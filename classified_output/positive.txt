Love it, it's fast slim, and very sleek.I am very happy with my cell phone.Beautiful and friendlyOne to use, and one to send back for repair.Actually a fine phone when it works.Like I say, just buy 2.Not the best quality.It is impossible to speak with anyone at the repair center and the customer service is equally hopeless.My advice is to keep your money.If you are ever unfortunate enough to need a repair you will be on your own.I've tried several things and no luck.It sits there and I'm not even using it, you guessed it, restarts.That is very irregular.My first time owning a Sony Phone.Its cheap plus have amazing specs.very goodGreatThank you for your time.Having been told it would take about 14 business days to fix and send my phone back, I am currently still waiting and we are on business day 28.I bought this one.Perfect .Amazing phone for that price .I recommended a lotReceived this product very quickly after purchase (I ordered it monday and got it on friday).Do not buy this product.This is my first comment.A very sturdy phone, little bit slushy at times, but makes my teen-aged son happy-happy.Heats up soon with few apps/games running (and especially if you have a protective case).As an ardent Sony fan, the price and the quality of this phone is good.Had for about a week, with no complains.Love itIt's a great size, lightweight and waterproof.Great deviceexcellent cellphone just a bit overheat when using it fullThis is Ok mobile, worth for the price.I've been a Sony user my whole life and I'm usually pretty pleased with them.Sony phones are super user friendly and I usually just like the overall quality of their phones, but this phone is a game changer!It does very well in low light and it seems to fit more into the picture, it also has cute editing settings for those who like to play with pics.A good phone.Very good phone!And bought another one from other brand!Anyway the phone is very fast and has a good size like the xperia z3!I love itGreat product.A good phone!Slow Phone!Looks good, takes good pictures but its slow and the Phone interface SUCKS big time.I'm delighted with it.Great phone.Its lack of LTE bands and limited space (16GB with no SD card) was a problem.CPU...not flagship quality but... you know.Its not a flagship phone but it is also 1/3 the price of a flagship phone.It offers all the gsm LTE bands you could want (for the US).Its thin.I like the relatively squared corners of the M4.It gives the illusion of a good phone to screen size ratio.I completely understand others might not share these opinions.Its just my preference.For the money its a good phone.Its a beautiful phone..especially in its price range.The battery has been absolutely fantastic for my use.When I am at work I probably listen to music (from the SD card) for about 4-5 hours a day.Well the camera itself is quite nice.Its slow.Everything was working fine for days/weeks.Its been fine since then.Not sure what happened or what caused the issue but all seems fine now.Great phone.Battery lasts all day even with high usage.Their quality control is completely ridiculous and constantly send out defective phones.Downloads are super quick on LTE (Panama's 10x10Mhz 700Mhz Band 28 LTE went as fast as 50mbps/20mbps dl/ul) Micro SD card support up to 128GB.Bootloader can be officially unlocked and there is a small custom ROM community on xdaCons: Can get laggy with games.Display is not as good as the Z3 seriesCamera quality is so-soGets a bit hot with extended use though it cools quickly.No double tap to wake like on the Z3 series.Comes with useless bloatware installed,luckily some of it can be eliminated.Overall.I'm happy with it for now.As always Sony is ahead of the pack of phones I have ever owned.The processor is pretty quick and it has 16GB memory with the capability of adding a microSD to expand an additional 128GB.Calling and texting work well.Phone instantly started overheating as soon as I turned it on and began to set it up.Horrible.Excelent price, excelent hardware and price... great phone....Heats up like hell.Cant hold to the face.This is the behavior right out the box.Wished had opened it sooner to send back.Over heating and restarts on it own several time in a day.As a second for my house hold use.Cobtiuesly having issues of restart regardless of uninstalling lot of apps and running with n dafe mode for a while.May be next time I should think or wait till get a good review on new phones.Good design but it slow compared for the price rangeGreat phoneMy son loves this phone.It worked great with the Straight Talk Sim card I purchased here on Amazon for a discount.awesome phoneMIC/SPEAKER STOPPED WORKING 2 WEEKS AFTER THE 30 DAY REFUND/RETURN PERIOD!!!Great!phone is very sleek and attractive.pretty quick response time .. overall impressed with this phone.has gotten a little warm with heavy use but nothing extreme like noted in some of the other reviews, completely happy with my choice.. my last phone was a galaxy s4 active.i would so make the same decision againvery goodLove it.It's awesome for a $200 phone!It is waterproof.It works with any network that uses Sim cards.Camera is okay.The warranty is badass.Very good!You get what you pay for has some issues bit price was rightLove this phone for my daughterExcelent price.It's a good Android Phone, not the top but good enough.MY husband loves itI bought this product on january 2016 as new.This is a review on both the product and Sony's service.Sony received the RMA shipment on May 25th.Contact us next week...".Just as expected, a good phone with good specs and great durability.good price for smartphones.this phone suffer from Sudden death and the Sony support its the worst.No lo compre se apaga y no vuelve a prender el servicio de sony apesta es el peor te mandan de un lado a otro.nice phone, recommendedThis model is mid range ,I can't imagin what a top of the line Sony would be like.Xperia fan for lifeI will not be buying this again.Excellent phone.Couldn’t be happier.What else can I say.nice!Figured I'd just buy a new phone.Worst phone ever had in life.Please adviseGood phone.VERY waterproof.The speaker is the worst, you can barely listen at people The camera takes horrible pictures and using the flash you only see big giant white stainsI am very satisfied, I exceeded my expectations, excellent cost-benefit.This is a disappointment for a phone with "aqua" in the name.It often lasts less than 12 hours.Sony customer support was worthless as usual.I purchased this phone when the price first dropped to $200 on Black Friday.I use this for everything, from setting appointments, sharing files across apps, playing Candy Crush, running with RunKeeper and playing music, using Waze/Google Maps and posting on Facebook.It acts fine with using one app at a time, but crashes, overheats and slows down completely when multitasking.It takes decent photos, and is just the right size for me.Bought for my wife.She takes a lot of pictures with her camera and this works perfectly for her.The phone part is also nice.I have a Sony and like it very much.Bluetooth with my Sony TVExcelent phone at a good price !!Recomended 100%I love itT-Mobile sim bought with it was perfect, too.Pros+Good Looking Design+Good Performance+Waterproof+MicroSD Expansion+Good Camera+Android Pay CompatibleCons-Okay Screen-Average Speaker-Average Battery Life-Decent Performance-Not the only good phone availableShould you buy: YESActual Value $200Sony has made a lot of great, if a bit too frequent, phones.With a waterproof design and glass construction, it has a great record of making phones.In 2014, I would’ve recommended this phone instantly.However, in 2016, is it still a good buy among the rest of the excellent lineup of 2015?In short, it is a good phone.This also makes it a bit disappointing to find a plastic frame instead of a metal one that is found on its older brother.But considering its price, this is something that can be forgiven.That being said, I recommend buying a case immediately in order to prevent any part of the glass from shattering.The top one is an earpiece for calling and the bottom one is a microphone.There is also your typical power and volume rocker, along with a two-stage button.It is packing a Snapdragon 615 with 2GB of RAM, 720p display, Android Lollipop, and microSD card expansion.It is a respectable score for the price.But sometimes the bloatware that Sony adds to the phone makes it stutter a bit, particularly when multitasking a lot of apps.Signal quality, for the most part, is good.Call quality is also good from both ends of the call, with both earpiece and loudspeaker providing loud volume and above average quality.But it still performs well and should be great for most people.-Display-The phone has a 1280 x 720 HD display with a pixel density of 294 ppi.Colors are good, but not excellent.They are good enough, but next to something like the S5, OnePlus, or even the Alcatel Idol 3 the colors look a bit washed out.The white balance is slightly towards the blue side, but it isn’t that noticeable.Thankfully, Sony does allow for tweaking the display settings should you want to make it good.Only thing I have of concern is the glass on the display.I have not found a confirm report as to what the glass is (Gorilla Glass, Dragontrail); the only thing I have found it to be listed as is “scratch-resistant glass.” Just something to keep in mind.I couldn’t find any specific information on the sensor in the back, with Sony limiting themselves to only saying it is a Sony Exmor RS model, but no specific requirement in particular.So, is it good?In general, yes.Low light is surprisingly good for the price.Sure, it isn’t up to the level of an S6 or a G4, but it is above what most other phones can deliver.The phone has a custom Sony skin that would look okay if the other apps that you had look similar.Apps such as XPERIA Lounge and Playstation Video are useless for me since I don’t have a Playstation and other such as Sketch and AR effect are fun, but ultimately just gimmicks.There are also a few small apps that can be used while using another app, for example the browser, a timer, and a calculator.There are also some small apps that can be downloaded from the Play Store, but you still can’t use any apps.Everything else works similarly to stock Android, with performance being much better if there hadn’t added some annoying bloatware to the mix.The good news is that Sony promises an update to 6.0 Marshmallow for 2016, so that is a positive note.Just a little bit of information that you should know: Sony never directly states that it is completely waterproof.Nevertheless, it is good on its promise of being water resistant.Placing it underwater for 20 minutes completely submerged didn’t harm it and listening to music in the shower worked great.Independently, it is a really good phone with good performance for what it is in addition to a beautiful design and waterproofing that gives users the confidence to have it in the rain.For starters, if you want the best bang for your buck, there is the Blu Life One X with a better screen and similar design for less money at $149.If you want a compact phone, there is the Alcatel Idol 3 4.7 at $179 which is still a good phone that is lighter.Honestly, any of the above options are great and they are cheaper than the M4.If you really need the waterproofing, then this is one of your cheaper options and definitely the one to get.But for everyone else, the other options would probably be better.Each time this happens a factory reset appears to correct the issue, but clearly that is inconvenient.Love this phone!I get 4g LTE with tmoblie.All I can say is WOW!Works great on Tmobile network.Had this for about 3 weeks now.I'm an Iphone user who purchased and set this up for my mother in law.I was also impressed with the versatility/configurability of android, as this was my first real time spent setting it up.Thanks, very goodIt just resets on its own.I needed a spare phone and was considering a BLU phone until I found this at 50% off the MSRP.I love the aesthetics.It feels dense though.How small do you need your text?I have not been using it at its fullest limit.Next is the storage… this phone has the smallest of the 3 phones with 16 GB.So, this will limit the number of apps you can use and install.I saw this limit on a Samsung tablet and I believe this is the greatest detractor.Now, this also has an MicroSD slot.So potentially, you can store more pictures and music in this device.The LG G3 wins hands down with 32GB internal with MicroSD card expansion slot.As a spare phone, this Xperia M4 is perfect for me.The LG G3 wins this factor with a replaceable battery.Processor speed… This is the slowest on paper but it is future proofed with a 64-bit processor.The LG G3 speaker is on the back.Of the 3 phones mentioned, this has the BEST SPEAKER phone volume and SPEAKER for music.Camera… This has a 13 MP camera.IT IS THE BEST CAMERA OF ALL 3 PHONES NOTED.So, I can put this under the sink faucet and wash my phone.This phone uses a Nano-SIM.Sony splits ALL the received messages and sending a group MMS requires a subject.Get another app, like Google Messenger, Textra, Evolve SMS, etc.With all the benefits of this phone, I could not rate this phone below a five star.This is an good phone for the price you pay for it with a fluent minimalist interface that I like much more than other Android customizations, like TouchWiz.Awesome!Good quality & affordable price!Thanks Sony!Great!!!nice phoevery nice phone love itVery goodit good for price, work tmobile nano pin litle hot dowlingThe headphone plug doesn't seem quite as sturdy but if it works it works, the sound with my sony earbuds (the best earbuds for price too) is louder and seems to sound better on the M4 Aqua which is also good.Love the phone and it's under water capabilities.I absolutely love this phone.And yes it is waterproof which makes it even better.I will strictly be buying Sony Xperia phones from now on.I am enjoying my phone.It's my first non-windows phone in 7 years.But nope, is just ok. Ah, is really a pretty phone, good quality screen.ITS A GREAT PHONE!Great smartphone.The price was even better.Thanks.Another great Xperia smartphone from Sony.Nothing to complain about.Great phone.to prank my friends I poured water on it thrown it in puddles and tossed around with a case of course and it's still fine.Excellent works very well in Venezuela MovistarOh this phone is great.I love SONY!!Sleek design and very good.all fineExcelentLove itReally good for the price.If you buy a phone for casual photos you'll be fine... if the camera is biggest deal ever for you then you may be disappointed.This is a sweet phone.They make the phone look really classy like Sonys higher end models.The insides are quality components that should perform better, but comparison tests show that it is a bit slower than similar hardware.Attribute that to the 'pretty'sony software/theme.What more to ask for?Battery life is impressive: with everything on (broadband data, wifi, bluetooth) and normal use (texting, phone, some surfing) it can go 3.5 to 4 days between full charge.Incredible phone, and looks very nice.Yes, get this phone and you will have a smart phone with a smart user, instead of blowing a grand on some ARM PoS that can barely compute.Overall.User experience is excellent with the price.Very Good Smartphone!Im happy with this cellphone is very fastGreat!So far it's nice.I really hope I can enable voice to text.The port covers are awesome, much better than those on the first z.great phone easy to use, the only disadvantage I found is that it heats rapidlyboth the frontal and back cameras have a very good resolutionAmazon cheated me on this.I tried to register on Sony support site.Battery drains fast.Back Camera takes awful pictures.Feeling cheated.Best phone I have ever owned and clearly one of the top ten Android phones ever made.Excellent phone does everything as advertised.I'm very happy.This is my first mid grade Smart Phone, and I love it so far!If I have one word to describe this phone, it would be: slow.It takes 3-4 sec to take the shot, which is a very very long time.I was taping two of our friends saying 'I do' at their wedding, and afterwards it turned out there was absolutely nothing on the tape (you did see that something was taped though, and I could 'play' it, but as said, it is completely black).Next video I tried turned out fine - no idea why.This is completely unacceptable for a brand new phone!Their only solution is to restart the phone.ExcelenteI got this on a lightening deal for $200 bucks.If you are a heavy user, you might not get one day.In spite of reviews, games with a lot of graphics do not play well with this phone, a lot of lag.Angry Birds, Minion Rush, laggy.Audio connected thought Bluetooth is loud.Call quality is ok. Works great with Android Pay.Great phone, good price.Pros- Thin.Is water resistant.Cons- Weak radios for wifi and LTE signal strengths weaker than $25 Moto G. "Skips" during playback of MP3 files-- that is just downright pathetic!Comes loaded with all kinds of Sony bloatware.Slow loading apps.Slow loading Chrome and Maps.About me: I'm a old school nerd.Very speedIt works very well!The Sony Xperia M4 Aqua is an excellent device for those on a budget looking for a good Android phone.Although, the first phone I received would keep powering off on its own.But I contacted Amazon about the issue, and they sent me a replacement.The front, and back cameras are both very clear.The flash on this Sony phone is bright and gives you the right lighting to take capture every moment.The phone features excellent speakers to listen to music.Watch a movie, or anything else you want.What can I do I just bought the phoneNo noticeable lag other than starting the camera.Although the phone might be pretty awesome for the price IT IS NOT COMPLETELY WATERPROOF!just love it!Great deal!Decent quality phone for the price.New phone works perfectly so far.EXCELLENTTried to fix it using several different versions of Sony's software updater to little effect.I only write this review because I saw it for the price I bought it for.Update 10/11/2016Tried another new update from sony still stuck on the bootloop.This is just becoming my own fault.I should of made the time to finally get the RMA and return this phone.It must no t put out a very strong signal.Excelent celphonebuena maquina.Great product.If you purchase this phone, also realize that accessories are extremely limited.Nice phoneFast processor and Sony makes it easy to update android versions.After a google search we weren't the only ones experiencing this problem.I say pass and get something more reliable and less bloatware.My advice is, if you plan to take an extended trip some where be sure to take your charging cable and a spare charge.I do like the phone anyway.Build quality is good, processor is fast, and the screen is beautiful.I'm very pleased with this phone and for the price it's a winner!very good phone !!It is amazing and it works as good as a phone of $400Got this for $150 before Christmas.The processor speed and internal storage of only 16GB might deter some from considering buying this M4, but consider what that means in real world functionality.The difference of a processor that is 1.2Ghz or 1.8Ghz in real word application is so minimal that the average smartphone user will NEVER notice the difference.What makes a huge difference is the smoothness of the OS and the skins companies overlay on top of a platform like ANDROID.I have used NEXUS brand phones with similar processing speed and I have noticed a slight difference in the smoothness of the OS, but I would attribute that to the fact that a purely vanilla ANDROID experience will always give you smoother performance when compared to other phones that come with "bloatware" or other skins.(But yes it comes with bloatware that really impacts your storage, so delete as much of the bloatware as you can, your battery and phone will thank you!Very slow focusing and the pictures appear to be overly saturated.(An SD card will absolutely be needed, so if you are going with this phone, please order on along with it.Summation:In all the price and build quality is a plus for a phone that is 2 years old.The smartphone industry moves fast and there is always a better phone that is better than the BEST phone out there....(does that make sense?)But for everyday use for people who value a good value, I would recommend the SONY line and especially the M4 or comparable models.I do appreciate support that Sony offers on its products, and that alone helps me to be confident that I can get "some support" software wise and otherwise with this product.If you're considering this phone for yourself or spouse or other...it's a good buy in my opinion.Hope it helps you with your decision.Cheers!A very solid, budget-minded phone offering from Sony!And at a reasonable price.I'ts a good cellphone!I'm connected to WiFi in different locations.I'm not happy with this purchase at allQuick response time.Great product.Good unlock phone for the price!great smartphone!I have always liked the little UI improvements Sony has done to the Android interface.Its thin, light and fits fairly well in the hand for a 5" phone.I'll give some info on how I use my phone so you can compare.Facebook, snapchat, some news feed aps, hangouts for sms and another 2 social aps.With using all those a few times over a 10 hour span I was over 60% all of the time.Speaker is not goodThis is my first Android phone, and it was purchased for a very specific purpose; I wanted a waterproof device to use for web browsing, reading, and messaging while I was on the beach or in the tub.Actually, it is more than just a complimentary device.I have an IT background, and I like tweaking options and squeezing extra battery or performance out of my devices.It's like a fun little challenge to me.As much as I love the reliability and increased productivity that iOS gives me, I loved the ability to mess around with so many options.It's plastic, and not glass like Sony's more elevated offerings.I tested this multiple times.The headphone jack and the usb port remain open during submersion though.As crazy as it sounds, it always works fine after a dunk.Do not buy this device for the camera.- This device lags a bit.Minecraft Pocket Edition has this constant choppiness regardless of how turned down the graphics settings are.Oddly, Pokemon Go worked great.I have a set of Eeros in my house, and this device had no problem connecting and offering great speed.- The Micro SD card slot is helpful, and kind of necessary.16GB is great for a casual user like me, but if you want to do anything above and beyond you're going to need some extra storage.This is both in terms of them hearing me, and me hearing them.- The screen size is perfect.I truly wish Apple made a single phone that was this size, instead of its current offerings.It's sleek.It's thin.It's from my second favorite hardware company in the world, Sony.It's water resistant.It's bright enough to use in the sun.It really makes a perfect second phone.Great design awesome music play back camera is good haven't used it much to be honestThey r not charging as they should..Love the slim look.With the Marshmallow update, I am using the SD card as adoptable storage, and as the storage backing the /storage/emulated/0 space (so it is the default spot for pictures, app data, etc).The storage space reported in settings->storage also is a little wonky.But other than that, it works fine.Everything is fine... 👍Good smartphoneHas Russian in settings.Excellent phone.I was pleased with the Sony Xperia M4 Aqua.Thank you Sony and Amazon!PerfectoPrice worth the livingI only had it for 4 days, it was awesome till I got it stolen.This is my second Xperia phone and boy do I love it.The pictures are perfect.Completely waterproof (Tested with the bathtub) and works great.Not too excited with performance.Wifi is iffy.a bit wonky system wise but overall a good phoneGrat phone.Quality / PriceGreat Phone forGreat pricePhone is sleek and nice.funciona barbaro, espero que siga asiReally good!excellent product qualityIt takes nice pictures, and it works very well apart from the fact that I can't hear it some times.I have normal hearing by the way.I bought it for $145 and it is what it is.I do like the look.This phone is awesome.The phone looks amazing and takes amazing pictures as well.The media experience for music, pictures, and video all have a nice appearance and easy navigation.GoodAs expected good productI love the looks, I love the OS, I love the theoretical waterproofing.The challenge is durability.The first one stopped recognizing the SIM card.This is a beautiful phone.75% as good as my blu, the touch is too or less sincitive .At diff.Times.A few Sony phones have a known issue with their ear piece speaker (this model included), and you will have to wait for months to get it repaired/replaced even under warranty.Aside from all this, the interface is great, super fast.This is a very slow phone.As person who's lost several phones to water, this phone meets that expectation, but overall, this phone is lackingeverything was perfect!Nice phone.Excelent phone!Good item.Excellent product, arrived at the right timeI was very optimistic, im an Android lover.I tried to love the phone, the build material is great and feels good in the hands.Excellent phone for an excellent price!Looks and feels great, and the screen is awesome.Thanks excellentAwesomef.... small sim card .For the sub-$300 price, this device sounds great on paper.One major downside of this device that actually also affects the flagship z3 (and z5!)is the screen-to-body ratio.The top and bottom bezels on this device are LARGE.It's also quite slick, due to the rounded edges.The Snapdragon 615, while definitely a mid-range CPU, should really make this thing at least "feel" snappy with regard to the interface.In extremely bright outdoor lighting, you can definitely capture some great STILL shots.Indoors, or with moving subjects, do expect much less than stellar image quality.After shooting, expect several seconds to pass before you can take another shot.Using a third-party camera such as Google Camera or Camera FV-5 are lightyears ahead in speed.No dice.Well, surprise of the year, it didn't solve anything.After chatting with a second Xperia Care rep, I was told I had to CALL for an actual RMA.To my disappointment, I was not even provided a return shipping label with my RMA number.I was furthermore warned several times that if there was any sign of water damage that my warranty would not be honored.It's quite inexpensive, at least.If you are looking for the dual sim model this is NOT it.Thought it was but had to return it.Other than that it is a lovely phone.Dual sim models are E2333, E2363, E2312.I am now fresh on the hunt for the E2363 16gb.Good price & goob phoneVery nice, solid performer.I like it very much.Perfectgreat product, excellent serviceexcellent phone.Perfectexcellent product, 100% recommendedit's amazingfall in love with thisI bought this as a Christmas gift for my brother.He loves it.I'm glad it's waterproof and dustproof, as he can be kind of clumsy and forgetful at times.This phone it's great!bought bring your own phone kit.make sure gms service.You have to restart it to play YouTube videos.Comes with an awkward charger and earphone.Too much expectationsExcelentCheap phone that has very good specs for the price ($150).UPDATE: Decreased from four stars to two stars.Reasons:1.A lot.Faulty GPS location.Don't let the stylish exterior fool you, there are better phones within this price range.Great phone.-Fast and very sleek looking.-Screen is good for what the cost.-Pretty good battery life.-Button are clicky and nice to touch.-Great to hold.Not a flagship be any means, but is good overall phone.Have some issues from time to time, when it restarts in sleep mode with data on.It's worth the moneyNice look & speedyI love itGot this phone as a gift for my mother and she found it easy to use!The only downside is that it only has one speaker.Given the price its still a great phone!I don't usually look for extreme performance.Great phone, definitely a Sony customer nowLaggy performance.Restarts occasionally on its own.Very cool phone.Light and attractive phone.Will update when replacement arrives.Excelentereceived all ok.Thank you very much.Disappointed!!I bought the phone on behalf of my brother, he surprise his wife with the phone for Mothers Day.It works great she said!She is very happy with the phone.Has got heating Issues.Gui could have been much better.Rest works wellHORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!I purchased a case and screen protector with the phone and take very good care of it.Then it was flagged as requiring immediate attention by a supervisor.There is no oversight and no accountability for totally disregarding their own policy and for the dissatisfaction of their customers.I got this with a warehouse deal for $139, at that price this is a great phone.The form factor is durable and attractive, but it is incredibly light.Same goes for when multitasking demanding apps.I was satisfied with this phone.Its says unlocked but it isn'tThe Phone just randomly restarts, multiple times a day.I reset it, and have done everything I can think of.I can be using it and all of sudden it will restart.greatSony makes solid phones.Incredible phone, perfection at a very reasonable price.Good product for the price.Would easily slip from your fingers though.A good solution is to purchase a rubberized case.I love it!Good phone at a great price.I'm coming from a Nokia 635.I looked at the Alcatel Idol 3 (4.7 the 5.5 seemed too big), which I almost purchased but, the M4 aqua had a slightly better processor.I really liked the design of the Moto G 3rd gen but it was $20 more for the 16gb version and had a lesser quality processor.the speaker.Horrible tiny sound, heck my Nokia 635 had better sound.I'm happy with it so far to post pictures on FB and such.Like I said, shady and DISHONEST CUSTOMER SUPPORT.Google sends a replacement phone for their customers.3.It takes a while to boot up and even receiving messages.Sony will not allow you to make a return.This 14 day period doesnt include shipping and repair time, also they don't send you a label unless u ask for it.Heats up freezes.I bought this for my mother as she keeps dropping her phones into liquid.She is now getting great reception inside her house using the newly added GSM band 12.I'm sure the improved signal has something to do with that.Overall, no heating issues and mom is happy.It is a great phone for the price range.its like second hands.Every went well with the purchase and arrival time.Everything works greatScreen is very sensitive!it good for price, work tmobile nano pin litle hot dowlingVery happy with this purchase !The phone is brand new and came sealed in its package.Great phone.Highly recommended.Had three iPhone previously and this is better.Only downside is that Apple blocks my group text messages.Easy fix by downloading textra.If you're thinking about switching from iPhone to android you should but read the blogs about group messages first prior to turning off your iPhone.Nice phone for the price.Voice quality is good.playing your music or listening to the radio comes out quite clear and I have no problems with any additional apps which I added.Bought Phone in Dec 2018 New Worked fine until May 2016 phone continues to run hotter and hotter until the newest flaw is it sparks when inserting charger!What a piece of Junk!Typical Sony product, simple, fun, fairly easy to use....Love it!Slow camera, little space.It works in Argentina so, couldn't ask for more, good performance,and excellent camera.Is good!niceTerrible customer service.Its fine, but the wifi power its little than than m2, I have both...Excellent Product, RecommendedsatisfyPhone is sluggish during routine usage and touchscreen is inaccurate.Camera and sound are top-notch.I love this phone Is The best cell I buyVery Nice Phone, Good Shape and nice Tech SpecsSlow Phone!Looks good, takes good pictures but its slow and the Phone interface SUCKS big time.I personally like the Samsung Galaxy phones, but I really like the security of knowing that this model is waterproof.extra clear hi def display and feels solidI started using ios a few years ago.After a few years, I got bored of it.I got it 2 moths back (November 7).The skin is very close to stock lollipop android.There are lots of settings to enhance your photo experience.A very big setback is its lack of flash.The heating problem is not a big deal.These games played pretty well with occasional lag, although it's almost unnoticeable.The phone scored 25841on antutu, single core 527 on geekbench 3, and multicore 1905 on geekbench 3.Decent enough.Conclusion: overall I am very pleased and satisfied with the experia m4 aqua.Loud and deep bass.But so far is the best for under $100.For the price, it's great.Overall, good phone.Amazing phone.Not goodIts not very good as its written in descriptionsA Google search indicates that this is a common problem, great.Great phone for a great price.Waterproof too?Winner!When I transfer my Sim card it says it's not supported.I am not satisfied at all with this sony product.I am going to return this product.Great phone!Good features in low cost..Good shipping and item.I am extremely happy with my purchase.The display buttons are larger than the phone I had before, and now I can text almost twice as fast.So do your research think about it, then get this phone.Works perfect and arrived earlier than expected :)Good product por the priceReturned next day.waterproofI thought maybe because it was a damaged box product.Absolutely Fantastic phone for the money....Everything okGood.Perfect!Thank You very much!AwesomeVery nice, the battery life is awesome.Not happy whit this purchase.I don't usually write reviews but after using this phone for a couple of weeks, I feel like it deserves the rating that I am giving.This is a really good practical phone to be using.Great phone with great qualityWill not buy another[ keeps shutting down ]Bought the phone as a cheap back up and for when we go to the beach or in wet conditions.Returned the phone and got a moto G 3rd generation.Do not buy this phone.Super great phone.Don't miss the note 4 a bit.Ecellent cellphoneThis one works perfectly once you remove all the pre-installed crapware.It does a slide show screen saver thing with your pictures that was a welcome surprise for my wife.The phone is amazingly thin.It actually makes me nervous, because it's so thin.I like to dunk it just for fun.GoodDo not buy this phone!!!!!!!I bought this phone on Cyber Monday 2015 as of today March 13th 2016 the phone took a dump on me.It keeps shutting off and there is no way to fix it.Well guess what.I'm assuming this might be the case but I'm not sure.You will regret it.WRONG!!!You WILL be very frustrated with this phone and have buyers remorse.Its battery is pathetically weak.processing is slow.it hangs, it becomes unresponsive so many times.Excellent ProductWaste of money.great.Embarrassing buy.I'd skip this.- Try the Blu Studio Energy 2ExcellentGreat product, accurate description and reasonable price.I'm only giving it 3 stars as my previous phone was a Z3 and the build and camera quality is a noticeable step down.Excellent.!compared to the price of the phone is very good.among the shortcomings is a tendency to run hotter and the camera is not like top models.I've had it barely a day.Excelente producto.This phone, just i love it!Great phone.Came with 16GB of non-volatile memory,has expansion slot for micoSD card up to 128GB.Unless you are a pro photog, the camera is more than adequate.Battery life seems typical of what I have experienced with other phones.Great deal!Decent quality phone for the price.New phone works perfectly so far.EXCELLENTTried to fix it using several different versions of Sony's software updater to little effect.I only write this review because I saw it for the price I bought it for.Update 10/11/2016Tried another new update from sony still stuck on the bootloop.This is just becoming my own fault.I should of made the time to finally get the RMA and return this phone.It must no t put out a very strong signal.Excelent celphonebuena maquina.Great product.If you purchase this phone, also realize that accessories are extremely limited.It's a great size, lightweight and waterproof.I'm delighted with it.Great phone.Its lack of LTE bands and limited space (16GB with no SD card) was a problem.CPU...not flagship quality but... you know.Its not a flagship phone but it is also 1/3 the price of a flagship phone.It offers all the gsm LTE bands you could want (for the US).Its thin.I like the relatively squared corners of the M4.It gives the illusion of a good phone to screen size ratio.I completely understand others might not share these opinions.Its just my preference.For the money its a good phone.Its a beautiful phone..especially in its price range.The battery has been absolutely fantastic for my use.When I am at work I probably listen to music (from the SD card) for about 4-5 hours a day.Well the camera itself is quite nice.Its slow.Everything was working fine for days/weeks.Its been fine since then.Not sure what happened or what caused the issue but all seems fine now.Great phone.Battery lasts all day even with high usage.Their quality control is completely ridiculous and constantly send out defective phones.Downloads are super quick on LTE (Panama's 10x10Mhz 700Mhz Band 28 LTE went as fast as 50mbps/20mbps dl/ul) Micro SD card support up to 128GB.Bootloader can be officially unlocked and there is a small custom ROM community on xdaCons: Can get laggy with games.Display is not as good as the Z3 seriesCamera quality is so-soGets a bit hot with extended use though it cools quickly.No double tap to wake like on the Z3 series.Comes with useless bloatware installed,luckily some of it can be eliminated.Overall.I'm happy with it for now.As always Sony is ahead of the pack of phones I have ever owned.The processor is pretty quick and it has 16GB memory with the capability of adding a microSD to expand an additional 128GB.Calling and texting work well.Phone instantly started overheating as soon as I turned it on and began to set it up.Horrible.Great phone, good price.Pros- Thin.Is water resistant.Cons- Weak radios for wifi and LTE signal strengths weaker than $25 Moto G. "Skips" during playback of MP3 files-- that is just downright pathetic!Comes loaded with all kinds of Sony bloatware.Slow loading apps.Slow loading Chrome and Maps.About me: I'm a old school nerd.Very speedIt works very well!The Sony Xperia M4 Aqua is an excellent device for those on a budget looking for a good Android phone.Although, the first phone I received would keep powering off on its own.But I contacted Amazon about the issue, and they sent me a replacement.The front, and back cameras are both very clear.The flash on this Sony phone is bright and gives you the right lighting to take capture every moment.The phone features excellent speakers to listen to music.Watch a movie, or anything else you want.What can I do I just bought the phoneNo noticeable lag other than starting the camera.Although the phone might be pretty awesome for the price IT IS NOT COMPLETELY WATERPROOF!just love it!MY husband loves itI bought this product on january 2016 as new.This is a review on both the product and Sony's service.Sony received the RMA shipment on May 25th.Contact us next week...".Just as expected, a good phone with good specs and great durability.good price for smartphones.this phone suffer from Sudden death and the Sony support its the worst.No lo compre se apaga y no vuelve a prender el servicio de sony apesta es el peor te mandan de un lado a otro.nice phone, recommendedThis model is mid range ,I can't imagin what a top of the line Sony would be like.Xperia fan for lifeI will not be buying this again.Excellent phone.Couldn’t be happier.What else can I say.nice!Figured I'd just buy a new phone.Worst phone ever had in life.Please adviseGood phone.VERY waterproof.The speaker is the worst, you can barely listen at people The camera takes horrible pictures and using the flash you only see big giant white stainsGreat deviceexcellent cellphone just a bit overheat when using it fullThis is Ok mobile, worth for the price.It's taking up a lot of memory space.I've been a Sony user my whole life and I'm usually pretty pleased with them.Sony phones are super user friendly and I usually just like the overall quality of their phones, but this phone is a game changer!It does very well in low light and it seems to fit more into the picture, it also has cute editing settings for those who like to play with pics.A good phone.Very good phone!And bought another one from other brand!Anyway the phone is very fast and has a good size like the xperia z3!I love itGreat product.A good phone!Love it, it's fast slim, and very sleek.I am very happy with my cell phone.Beautiful and friendlyOne to use, and one to send back for repair.Actually a fine phone when it works.Like I say, just buy 2.Not the best quality.It is impossible to speak with anyone at the repair center and the customer service is equally hopeless.My advice is to keep your money.If you are ever unfortunate enough to need a repair you will be on your own.I've tried several things and no luck.It sits there and I'm not even using it, you guessed it, restarts.That is very irregular.My first time owning a Sony Phone.Its cheap plus have amazing specs.Great!phone is very sleek and attractive.pretty quick response time .. overall impressed with this phone.has gotten a little warm with heavy use but nothing extreme like noted in some of the other reviews, completely happy with my choice.. my last phone was a galaxy s4 active.i would so make the same decision againvery goodLove it.It's awesome for a $200 phone!It is waterproof.It works with any network that uses Sim cards.Camera is okay.The warranty is badass.Very good!You get what you pay for has some issues bit price was rightLove this phone for my daughterExcelent price.It's a good Android Phone, not the top but good enough.T-Mobile sim bought with it was perfect, too.Pros+Good Looking Design+Good Performance+Waterproof+MicroSD Expansion+Good Camera+Android Pay CompatibleCons-Okay Screen-Average Speaker-Average Battery Life-Decent Performance-Not the only good phone availableShould you buy: YESActual Value $200Sony has made a lot of great, if a bit too frequent, phones.With a waterproof design and glass construction, it has a great record of making phones.In 2014, I would’ve recommended this phone instantly.However, in 2016, is it still a good buy among the rest of the excellent lineup of 2015?In short, it is a good phone.This also makes it a bit disappointing to find a plastic frame instead of a metal one that is found on its older brother.But considering its price, this is something that can be forgiven.That being said, I recommend buying a case immediately in order to prevent any part of the glass from shattering.The top one is an earpiece for calling and the bottom one is a microphone.There is also your typical power and volume rocker, along with a two-stage button.It is packing a Snapdragon 615 with 2GB of RAM, 720p display, Android Lollipop, and microSD card expansion.It is a respectable score for the price.But sometimes the bloatware that Sony adds to the phone makes it stutter a bit, particularly when multitasking a lot of apps.Signal quality, for the most part, is good.Call quality is also good from both ends of the call, with both earpiece and loudspeaker providing loud volume and above average quality.But it still performs well and should be great for most people.-Display-The phone has a 1280 x 720 HD display with a pixel density of 294 ppi.Colors are good, but not excellent.They are good enough, but next to something like the S5, OnePlus, or even the Alcatel Idol 3 the colors look a bit washed out.The white balance is slightly towards the blue side, but it isn’t that noticeable.Thankfully, Sony does allow for tweaking the display settings should you want to make it good.Only thing I have of concern is the glass on the display.I have not found a confirm report as to what the glass is (Gorilla Glass, Dragontrail); the only thing I have found it to be listed as is “scratch-resistant glass.” Just something to keep in mind.I couldn’t find any specific information on the sensor in the back, with Sony limiting themselves to only saying it is a Sony Exmor RS model, but no specific requirement in particular.So, is it good?In general, yes.Low light is surprisingly good for the price.Sure, it isn’t up to the level of an S6 or a G4, but it is above what most other phones can deliver.The phone has a custom Sony skin that would look okay if the other apps that you had look similar.Apps such as XPERIA Lounge and Playstation Video are useless for me since I don’t have a Playstation and other such as Sketch and AR effect are fun, but ultimately just gimmicks.There are also a few small apps that can be used while using another app, for example the browser, a timer, and a calculator.There are also some small apps that can be downloaded from the Play Store, but you still can’t use any apps.Everything else works similarly to stock Android, with performance being much better if there hadn’t added some annoying bloatware to the mix.The good news is that Sony promises an update to 6.0 Marshmallow for 2016, so that is a positive note.Just a little bit of information that you should know: Sony never directly states that it is completely waterproof.Nevertheless, it is good on its promise of being water resistant.Placing it underwater for 20 minutes completely submerged didn’t harm it and listening to music in the shower worked great.Independently, it is a really good phone with good performance for what it is in addition to a beautiful design and waterproofing that gives users the confidence to have it in the rain.For starters, if you want the best bang for your buck, there is the Blu Life One X with a better screen and similar design for less money at $149.If you want a compact phone, there is the Alcatel Idol 3 4.7 at $179 which is still a good phone that is lighter.Honestly, any of the above options are great and they are cheaper than the M4.If you really need the waterproofing, then this is one of your cheaper options and definitely the one to get.But for everyone else, the other options would probably be better.Each time this happens a factory reset appears to correct the issue, but clearly that is inconvenient.Love this phone!I get 4g LTE with tmoblie.All I can say is WOW!Works great on Tmobile network.Had this for about 3 weeks now.I'm an Iphone user who purchased and set this up for my mother in law.I was also impressed with the versatility/configurability of android, as this was my first real time spent setting it up.Thanks, very goodIt just resets on its own.I needed a spare phone and was considering a BLU phone until I found this at 50% off the MSRP.I love the aesthetics.It feels dense though.How small do you need your text?I have not been using it at its fullest limit.Next is the storage… this phone has the smallest of the 3 phones with 16 GB.So, this will limit the number of apps you can use and install.I saw this limit on a Samsung tablet and I believe this is the greatest detractor.Now, this also has an MicroSD slot.So potentially, you can store more pictures and music in this device.The LG G3 wins hands down with 32GB internal with MicroSD card expansion slot.As a spare phone, this Xperia M4 is perfect for me.The LG G3 wins this factor with a replaceable battery.Processor speed… This is the slowest on paper but it is future proofed with a 64-bit processor.The LG G3 speaker is on the back.Of the 3 phones mentioned, this has the BEST SPEAKER phone volume and SPEAKER for music.Camera… This has a 13 MP camera.IT IS THE BEST CAMERA OF ALL 3 PHONES NOTED.So, I can put this under the sink faucet and wash my phone.This phone uses a Nano-SIM.Sony splits ALL the received messages and sending a group MMS requires a subject.Get another app, like Google Messenger, Textra, Evolve SMS, etc.With all the benefits of this phone, I could not rate this phone below a five star.I am very satisfied, I exceeded my expectations, excellent cost-benefit.This is a disappointment for a phone with "aqua" in the name.It often lasts less than 12 hours.Sony customer support was worthless as usual.I purchased this phone when the price first dropped to $200 on Black Friday.I use this for everything, from setting appointments, sharing files across apps, playing Candy Crush, running with RunKeeper and playing music, using Waze/Google Maps and posting on Facebook.It acts fine with using one app at a time, but crashes, overheats and slows down completely when multitasking.It takes decent photos, and is just the right size for me.Bought for my wife.She takes a lot of pictures with her camera and this works perfectly for her.The phone part is also nice.I have a Sony and like it very much.Bluetooth with my Sony TVExcelent phone at a good price !!Recomended 100%I love itExcelent price, excelent hardware and price... great phone....Heats up like hell.Cant hold to the face.This is the behavior right out the box.Wished had opened it sooner to send back.Over heating and restarts on it own several time in a day.As a second for my house hold use.Cobtiuesly having issues of restart regardless of uninstalling lot of apps and running with n dafe mode for a while.May be next time I should think or wait till get a good review on new phones.Good design but it slow compared for the price rangeGreat phoneMy son loves this phone.It worked great with the Straight Talk Sim card I purchased here on Amazon for a discount.awesome phoneMIC/SPEAKER STOPPED WORKING 2 WEEKS AFTER THE 30 DAY REFUND/RETURN PERIOD!!!excelenteThis is an good phone for the price you pay for it with a fluent minimalist interface that I like much more than other Android customizations, like TouchWiz.Awesome!Good quality & affordable price!Thanks Sony!Great!!!nice phoevery nice phone love itVery goodSo far it's nice.I really hope I can enable voice to text.The port covers are awesome, much better than those on the first z.great phone easy to use, the only disadvantage I found is that it heats rapidlyboth the frontal and back cameras have a very good resolutionAmazon cheated me on this.I tried to register on Sony support site.Battery drains fast.Back Camera takes awful pictures.Feeling cheated.Best phone I have ever owned and clearly one of the top ten Android phones ever made.Excellent phone does everything as advertised.I'm very happy.This is my first mid grade Smart Phone, and I love it so far!If I have one word to describe this phone, it would be: slow.It takes 3-4 sec to take the shot, which is a very very long time.I was taping two of our friends saying 'I do' at their wedding, and afterwards it turned out there was absolutely nothing on the tape (you did see that something was taped though, and I could 'play' it, but as said, it is completely black).Next video I tried turned out fine - no idea why.This is completely unacceptable for a brand new phone!Their only solution is to restart the phone.ExcelenteI love Sony always....Perfect .Amazing phone for that price .I recommended a lotReceived this product very quickly after purchase (I ordered it monday and got it on friday).Do not buy this product.This is my first comment.A very sturdy phone, little bit slushy at times, but makes my teen-aged son happy-happy.Heats up soon with few apps/games running (and especially if you have a protective case).As an ardent Sony fan, the price and the quality of this phone is good.Had for about a week, with no complains.Love itvery goodGreatThank you for your time.Having been told it would take about 14 business days to fix and send my phone back, I am currently still waiting and we are on business day 28.I bought this one.I got this on a lightening deal for $200 bucks.If you are a heavy user, you might not get one day.In spite of reviews, games with a lot of graphics do not play well with this phone, a lot of lag.Angry Birds, Minion Rush, laggy.Audio connected thought Bluetooth is loud.Call quality is ok. Works great with Android Pay.ExcelentLove itReally good for the price.If you buy a phone for casual photos you'll be fine... if the camera is biggest deal ever for you then you may be disappointed.This is a sweet phone.They make the phone look really classy like Sonys higher end models.The insides are quality components that should perform better, but comparison tests show that it is a bit slower than similar hardware.Attribute that to the 'pretty'sony software/theme.What more to ask for?Battery life is impressive: with everything on (broadband data, wifi, bluetooth) and normal use (texting, phone, some surfing) it can go 3.5 to 4 days between full charge.Incredible phone, and looks very nice.Yes, get this phone and you will have a smart phone with a smart user, instead of blowing a grand on some ARM PoS that can barely compute.Overall.User experience is excellent with the price.Very Good Smartphone!Im happy with this cellphone is very fastGreat!Great smartphone.The price was even better.Thanks.Another great Xperia smartphone from Sony.Nothing to complain about.Great phone.to prank my friends I poured water on it thrown it in puddles and tossed around with a case of course and it's still fine.Excellent works very well in Venezuela MovistarOh this phone is great.I love SONY!!Sleek design and very good.all fineThe headphone plug doesn't seem quite as sturdy but if it works it works, the sound with my sony earbuds (the best earbuds for price too) is louder and seems to sound better on the M4 Aqua which is also good.Love the phone and it's under water capabilities.I absolutely love this phone.And yes it is waterproof which makes it even better.I will strictly be buying Sony Xperia phones from now on.I am enjoying my phone.It's my first non-windows phone in 7 years.But nope, is just ok. Ah, is really a pretty phone, good quality screen.ITS A GREAT PHONE!
