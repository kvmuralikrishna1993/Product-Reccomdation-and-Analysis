"258488","New 5.5""Sony Xperia C4 E5333 Black Factory Unlocked International Version no warranty",1,"Battery never lasted more than a few hours right from the first use. Ended up changing plans and got a better phone for a lot less money."
"258576","New Hatsune Miku Limited Edition SO-04e MK (Official unlocked mobile phone) (Limited Green)",5,"This is a very stunning looking phone with very nice exclusive apps that are only on this phone. If you are a vocaloid fan, you should really consider getting this phone. I would just like to say this though. I had used Verizon for quite some time but when I got this phone and did some looking into different networks and how they work I realized that Verizon uses very unique technology and after talking to their tech support for quite awhile we concluded that the technology they use is too different from the rest of the world to get this phone functioning on their network. However, I took it to AT&T (as they use a network much more similar to the rest of the world than Verizon) and it worked beautifully. Talk, text and wifi all worked great with just putting in a SIM card. In order to get the over the air internet (3G) working I had to set up an APN on the phone for AT&T's network (you can google the settings real easy).I thought about giving it 4 stars for not working with Verizon, but then realized that I can't take any credit away from this phone for being incompatible with a network that is different from pretty much ever other network in the world. 5 stars from me."
"277509","Nokia N97 Unlocked Phone with Touchscreen, 3G, 5 MP Camera, A-GPS, 32 GB, MicroSD Slot, and Integrated Ovi Applications--U.S. Version with Warranty (White)",4,"Tengo una semana de estar utilizando este teléfono celular. Es mi primer Nokia y al principio fue un poco frustrante por que no sabía donde buscar las aplicaciones, yo estaba acostumbrado a los celulares Sony Ericksson y me sentía muy cómodo con ellos pero por las características que presentaba el N97 su gran cantidad de memoria ser de tecnología 3G, los buenos comentarios que había escuchado y por precio decidí comprarlo en lugar de un Sony Ericksson.Como mencioné al principio me frustré pero era mas por desconocimiento que otra cosa por ejemplo le instalé el navegador Opra mini ya que el navegador que el trae no me gustaba pero cuando me conectaba a Internet lo hacía atravez del navegador predeterminado y yo no sabía que tenía que entrar a aplicaciones y de ahí accesar a Opra. Pero poco a poco fui encontrandole las aplicaciones y debo decir que ahora estoy muy contento.Las cosas buenas de este celular:1) Esteticamente es muy lindo, la resolución de la pantalla hace que las imágenes se vean muy nítidas.2)La cámara y el video no tienen nada que envidiarle a un artefacto dedicado es decir a una cámara digital o a una videocamara, las fotos son muy bien logradas y el flash realmente funciona en lugares oscuras se pueden apreciar perfectamente los detalles.3) La conexión a Internet es muy buena, gracias al zoom puedes agrandar o disminuir la imágenes las cuales se aprecian muy bien, logicamente hay páginas que por ser tan grandes no se observaran como en la computadora, pero en realidad la navegación es placentera siempre y cuando no tengas que estar digitando algo.4) Conectarte a las redes sociales o a tu correo electrónico esta a un click de distancia y como dige antes en segundos y puedes leer archivos en formato de word excel o PDF. Es decir si no estas cerca a de una computadora no hay ningún problema te sacará del apuro, aunque repito la experiencia aun no es como con la computadora pero ese es un problema en todos los teléfono inteligentes. Yo reviso mis estados de cuenta, puedo hacer una compra en Amazon pagar recibos entrar al banco hacer transacciones, etc, etc.5) El teléfono es robusto se ve fuerte aunque aun no se ha llevado ningún golpe6) Tiene todas las funciones de los teléfonos convencionales pero a diferencia de otros estas realmente cumplen por ejemplo si tienes una grabadora tu esperas que cuando des click esta realmente grabe y esta lo hace, yo he tenido telefonos que cuando quise usar la grabadora esta simplemente no funcionó. Puedes vivar con ello pero da cólera que una aplicación no funcione como debiera.Pero bueno no todo es perfecto y lo que no me gustó es lo incómodo que resulta a veces el teclado qwerty a veces cuando estoy navegando si por alguna razón tengo que digitar algo puedo desplegar texto en pantalla pero en otras ocasiones esta característica no esta disponible y me obliga a usar el teclado y no se si es la falta de costumbre pero soy mucho mas diestro con las teclas de un teléfono que con este tipo de teclado y me demoro mucho por lo que me resulta engorroso. Pero bueno no se talvez dentro de unos meses ya me halla acostumbrado.Pero por lo demás creo que son mucho mas las satisfacciones imaginense pueden utilizar este teléfono como un GPS yo en la particular no lo uso por que ya tengo un Garmin que es una belleza y al cual ya estoy super acostumbrado pero bueno esta es una aplicación que bien vale la pena utilizar si esta disponible. En sintesís le digo comprelo no se va a arrepentir, a y se me olvidaba la pantalla táctil funciona a las mil maravillas esta era una de mis principales dudas, pero me di cuenta que si funciona y excelentemente bien, el secreto es calibrarla la pantalla a tu gusto, si gustas de apretar mucho el lápiz pues así la calibras a mi me gustan los trazos suaves y así la calibré y apenas dejo caer el lápiz y la función se aplica. Así es que es una buena inversión la única razón por la que no le dí cinco estrellas fue por la razón del teclado por lo demás no hay quejas."
"277510","Nokia N97 Unlocked Phone with Touchscreen, 3G, 5 MP Camera, A-GPS, 32 GB, MicroSD Slot, and Integrated Ovi Applications--U.S. Version with Warranty (White)",4,"Big and heavy. It is difficult to configure access to web. Excellent sound and screen resolution."
"277511","Nokia N97 Unlocked Phone with Touchscreen, 3G, 5 MP Camera, A-GPS, 32 GB, MicroSD Slot, and Integrated Ovi Applications--U.S. Version with Warranty (White)",2,"This is an expensive phone with three major problems for which I gave it a two-star. First, the reception is much weaker comparing to my old phone (Motorola Ming). Once the reception is lost, it could take a minute or more for you to be able to see some signal bars appeared again. Second, the connection is another issue for this cell phone. It gives a lot of ""connection error"" messages, and I have experienced way more call drops since I changed to this cell phone. Also, the home screen rotates easily from vertical to horizontal, but it doesn't do the same backward. I have to shake the phone with some strength for the home screen rotate back to vertical. Overall, I am very disappointed with Nokia N97, but since I paid a good amount of money for it, I have to stick with it for a while."
"277512","Nokia N97 Unlocked Phone with Touchscreen, 3G, 5 MP Camera, A-GPS, 32 GB, MicroSD Slot, and Integrated Ovi Applications--U.S. Version with Warranty (White)",5,"I am very satisfied with this phone. Works great on AT&T 3G & EDGE networks. The Ovi Store is a great app store that allows you to download apps, themes, and other content for your Nokia phone safely. I would not recommend installing any apps that are not through the Ovi Store. I did and ended up having to reset my phone, losing some of the content that came originally on the phone. Great phone, though. Only drawback I have noticed is that depending on how you hold the phone, sometimes your voice comes across muffled to the person you are on the phone with."
"277513","Nokia N97 Unlocked Phone with Touchscreen, 3G, 5 MP Camera, A-GPS, 32 GB, MicroSD Slot, and Integrated Ovi Applications--U.S. Version with Warranty (White)",3,"I am a big Nokia fan and really liked my 5800 and 5530, so I was quite looking forward to playing with the N97. This is a exquisite piece of hardware, the feel of the device is the nicest of any phone I have owned. But the software is really showing its age, even compared to newer, cheaper Nokia phones.Nokia really are asleep at the wheel, the 5530 shows they can do reasonable job of making a touch phone using S60 but they have let their S60 flagship lag far behind other S60 phones that are less than half the price. I gave both the 5800 navigation edition and the 5530 XpressMusic 5 stars based on the great usability and incredible value, but the wonderful N97 hardware is let down by old software.Good:- Wonderful hardware.- Excellent call quality- Very extensive feature set.- Very nice screen in sunlight.- White color looks great.- Nice keyboard (except space bar).- 32GB internal storage.Bad:- Home screen lacks scrolling contacts of 5530.- Inconsistent touch menu (some double, some single tap).- Very small space bar.- Mediocre browser.- Weak FM transmitter (not powerful enough for car use).- Ovi Maps lack search (you need to have google maps installed too).- No in-line spell check.Don't even waste your time comparing this phone to true smartphones like nexusone, droid or iphone 3gs, its just not in that league software wise, only price wise. When you see what google and apple have done so early in the smartphone game, it really is a shame for Nokia. Such great hardware let down by such bad software. And before you say N900, I had one and returned it, maemo shows promise but is far from ready for primetime use and the hardware is a brick.If you have lots of money, already like Nokia S60 phones and have never used an iphone or droid you should love this phone. Everyone else steer clear of it, looks at the 5800 or 5530 if you wanna go Nokia."
"277514","Nokia N97 Unlocked Phone with Touchscreen, 3G, 5 MP Camera, A-GPS, 32 GB, MicroSD Slot, and Integrated Ovi Applications--U.S. Version with Warranty (White)",3,"The phone is very clean looking and I loved the keyboard and everything. However, the OS of this phone is old-school looking, and I didn't like that I had to use my nail to select things on the phone. I was use to the iPhone where you use your actual finger. The phone does let you use your fingers, but you end up choosing stuff that is above, below, or next to it. They give you an option to buy a stylus, but why do you HAVE to get a stylus to get better performance from the phone?There were also quite a few buggy problems that I had with the phone, but not serious enough to handicap the phone. This is a nice phone if you don't care about specifics and just need a phone to do basic things on.The camera I didn't feel was as awesome as they keep advertising. The quality was good enough but that's it. Not a huge WOW factor. Video was the same. Then again it is a phone, not a digital camera. I didn't like how I would turn off the flash of the phone and the light still went off when I took the picture (hard to be discreet).Overall, I think the phone was okay, had more cons than pros in my opinion."
"277515","Nokia N97 Unlocked Phone with Touchscreen, 3G, 5 MP Camera, A-GPS, 32 GB, MicroSD Slot, and Integrated Ovi Applications--U.S. Version with Warranty (White)",4,"Symbian is an acquired taste, if you don't like/not used to s60v5, you won't like it even with 2.0 firmware. 2.0 firmware is what the N97 should have been released with. Given the N97 mini is $50 cheaper and it is 99% of what the N97 is, I would get the mini instead."
"277516","Nokia N97 Unlocked Phone with Touchscreen, 3G, 5 MP Camera, A-GPS, 32 GB, MicroSD Slot, and Integrated Ovi Applications--U.S. Version with Warranty (White)",4,"Nice phone. Does not have the license to use all the applications included in it like the document editors, etc."
"277517","Nokia N97 Unlocked Phone with Touchscreen, 3G, 5 MP Camera, A-GPS, 32 GB, MicroSD Slot, and Integrated Ovi Applications--U.S. Version with Warranty (White)",4,"This phone and the Nokia service are superb. After the V2.0 Firmware update the phone runs smooth and fast. All the issues i was complaining about when I got it got improved and now it is a perfect phone. The keyboard is good the screen with kinetic scrolling are nice and the homescreen is not only good-looking but also very user-friendly. With 32 GB you can leave your mp3 player at home. It comes with a 3.5mm headphone clinch so you can use your normal headphones.I needed to send it already to repair because i dropped it really hard on the floor. The phone wouldn't switch on anymore and the slider was damaged, too. I send it for repair hoping not to pay anything. I waited a week for a email and actually wanted to call already but then the phone arrived without send me even an email. One week, inclusive shipping! The most impressive part was that they didn't just make it work again, but they also corrected all cosmetic damage. I didn't get a bill or anything. I was really surprised and that is a major + for this phone.I have to take off one point of this phone because of the Ovi Store. Most apps are ''light'' or you have to pay. There are actually very few apps only available. Most of the Ovi stuff are wallpapers and really bad ringtones. They have to really improve that store.My conclusionN97+appstore=the perfect phone. It is still an iphone killer i would say. If you're not to main stream and like phones nobody really has. Go with this. It's nice"
"277518","Nokia N97 Unlocked Phone with Touchscreen, 3G, 5 MP Camera, A-GPS, 32 GB, MicroSD Slot, and Integrated Ovi Applications--U.S. Version with Warranty (White)",3,"So I started using this phone about 5 or 6 months ago and have recently come to this decision to ditch it for a Nokia E75. I will list the pros and the cons I think that the Nokia N97 has....pros*Nice and eye-catching design....Many friends really liked the look of the phone and the sliding keyboard really excited some people*Satisfying web browsing....It has been really nice to look at some much-visited web pages and do some shopping online with the phone, most web sites load quickly and fully*Nice camera*Pretty decent music player....I used this phone with a 16GB card full of music as my primary head-phone music player most of the summer*Large screencons*widgets are a mixed bag...most of them are not really useful and would not connect consistently*""lock key"" on side of the phone has been a real pain....sometimes it would work, then not work, then not unlock, get stuck, etc*the touchscreen is just soooo not smooth and slick. I would often wonder if I had pressed something hard enough or not hard enough.*QWERTY keyboard is not very easy to use. The ""character"" button is right next to the ""space"" button so I was CONSTANTLY calling up a page of characters at the wrong time, which really slows down typing*on screen numeric key-pad is ok for T9 typing but very clumsy.... I am a very heavy texter and this got so frustrating for the amount of backspacing and deleting for most text messages*not pleasing photo gallery....the biggest problem I felt with this was just how unattractive it looks. I once had a Nokia N85 and the way it displayed the photos was very streamlined and neat looking. This device just lays them all out with no styling and also near the end of my using the device it would take so long to load that it got kind of embarrassing if I were trying to show someone a photo*general bulkiness of the device*high price tagand finally I just got tired of it turning off unexpectedly, re-booting itself, not being able to unlock it with the lock key, etc.So, as you can see it really isn't a bad phone. It just fell way short of my expectations for a Nokia ""flagship"" phone and also as a touchscreen device. I ordered the E75 out of sheer frustration and the desire to get away from a touchscreen. I've only had the E75 for a few days but in spite of the smaller screen, I now have a smaller, easily pocketable phone with a VERY VERY VERY nice QWERTY keyboard and a traditional keypad for T9 texting. Very happy with my new phone and kinda glad I don't have to deal with the frustration of all the N97's inconsistencies. Thanks for reading!"

Some menus disappear, navigation with the scroll bars is complicated, answering calls is not very functional and not very intuitive, has no blocking software toolmaker."
"277520","Nokia N97 Unlocked Phone with Touchscreen, 3G, 5 MP Camera, A-GPS, 32 GB, MicroSD Slot, and Integrated Ovi Applications--U.S. Version with Warranty (White)",3,"I found the product interesting because it promised 32 Gigabyte of memory. However accessing this memory is clumsy and navigation through the functions of the phone is combersome. It's touch screen functionality is primitive when compared to the Samsung Omnia, HTC Google phone and the iphone. I am not too impressed!"
"277521","Nokia N97 Unlocked Phone with Touchscreen, 3G, 5 MP Camera, A-GPS, 32 GB, MicroSD Slot, and Integrated Ovi Applications--U.S. Version with Warranty (White)",5,"This is the best phone I have ever owned, and I have owned plenty haha. This phone is so easily accessible and everything is where it should be. My only knocks on it is the GPS Signal is not very strong. I will have wide open blue skies and still cant get a GPS signal. Also I wish it was compatible with the Internet Radio that Nokia offers. I am sure it is only a matter of time. Some great things about this phone is the Video Ringtones the OVI Store, OVI Contacts, and I especially like the 32GB Internal Memory. It can be an MP3 Player and with the FM Transmitter good bye to CDs and I dont even use my iPod anymore. I also love the fact that the homescreen apps are up to date. I have Facebook, Weather, and a Video Game App that always let me know whats going on. The camera is amazing and has a great flash. I went to Vegas and took my digital camera and ended up not using it. I just used my N97. The battery life is great too. I had the fm transmitter on all day, along with normal phone calls, browsing the internet and excessive text messaging I still had 4 bars before I went to bed. I would recommend this phone to all. I also bought a phone cover from [...]. It is an extraordinary Industrial Strength full Phone cover and it is guaranteed for life so if it breaks they will replace it for free."
"277522","Nokia N97 Unlocked Phone with Touchscreen, 3G, 5 MP Camera, A-GPS, 32 GB, MicroSD Slot, and Integrated Ovi Applications--U.S. Version with Warranty (White)",1,"UPDATE: (Changed review from 1-star to 3-stars) After shipping the phone to the Nokia Service Center for repairs (sent on a Friday received back by the following Wednesday), the phone is working fine. There are still a few, small glitchy software issues - but otherwise functioning properly. I am not sure if it was this individual phone or if all N97s have software issues to start. However, now I am afraid to update the phone software, for fear that it will have more problems. One note: it was difficult to get in touch with support and speak to someone ""live."" I sent the phone in on blind trust without speaking to anyone - but all's well that ends well..._____________________________________________________________________________ORIGINAL REVIEW: I have had this phone since July 3, 2009. Since purchase I have had to deal with one issue after another, all related to the software and application interface. The hardware (physical) phone itself was great.Negatives:Too numerous to list all of them here, but essentially the software and applications are not intuitive and have MAJOR issues. I am fairly tech savvy and I cannot even imagine how someone who is less knowledgeable in this area would be able to deal with this phone. Very high maintenance.--It took me, and several tech geek friends, A LOT of time to figure out how to set up 2 email accounts.--The wireless access would not ""remember"" my wireless WEP key and typing that long# in repeatedly is not fun! It started 'saving' it on its own one day. (see reboot story below - now it doesn't save any more)--Facebook app and ""Favorites"" app won't load onto the home screen (just says ""Loading"" but never does). I tried to reinstall the Facebook app, but had to go to a 3rd party site to find it. Nokia's Ovi store no longer has a FB app available. Once an app is gone from your phone - good luck trying to reinstall it. Impossible. If you can even find the app anywhere.--Apps randomly work, then don't work. Very mysterious.Yesterday I had to do a hard reset back to the factory settings (which means I had to back up and then delete all of my data, photos, text messages, music, and loose all of my settings, including difficult-to-set-up email connection settings, etc), to try and get the non-working/disappeared apps to work. There wasn't much else I could do the software was so messed up. It was the last resort to get the phone to function properly. However, resetting it essentially ""killed"" the phone interface entirely. It is so bad that I just sent my phone to Nokia's repair site in Alabama (their ""customer care"" phone and email are essentially non-existant: phone tree loop and a ""generic"" email response is what they consider ""care."") Now, I am waiting to see if/when they fix the phone. Here is how the phone was ""working"" after the hard reset (that was supposed to bring it back to the original factory settings):--The key pad won't function (on screen) so I can't even try another hard reset.--The phone doesn't work (can't access it).--The camera won't function.--Most of the apps are missing. Including facebook and 'favorites'.--Most of the apps that are still on the phone won't function.--The phone shuts off when connected to the computer to update software.--The phone randomly shuts on and off when you try to access an app.--The 'memory full' message keeps appearing when there is nothing on the phone and there are no apps open.Among other issues...My main concerns about having to mail my new, $700 phone to a far away repair place are:(1) now I am stuck with NO PHONE for ""7-10+ days"" and I am trying to run a small business (ironically enough it is for usability testing of products such as this - and boy does Nokia need to test their N97 interface - have they actually read the Nokia Users Discussion board?), and;(2) the ""Repair form"" instructions for returning the phone state that they will ""call me with an estimate of the cost(shouldn't it be free?!)"" or that they will ""return the phone if it is not repairable."" That's just great. Can you tell that I am really annoyed? The phone cost $700!!!Positives:Nice hardware. The keyboard is easy to use and read. I liked the matte feel of the keys. The screen is large and crisp in terms of readbility, and I love the fact that you can use your finger or a stylus (or finger nail - which you can't do on the iPhone) to activate the touch screen. I love the weight and solid feel of the phone. The silver buttons and edging is also a nice touch. The camera, when it worked, took nice photos that rivaled my digital cameras' pics.The white phone is pretty cool looking - too bad it doesn't work!"
"277523","Nokia N97 Unlocked Phone with Touchscreen, 3G, 5 MP Camera, A-GPS, 32 GB, MicroSD Slot, and Integrated Ovi Applications--U.S. Version with Warranty (White)",1,"I had a Nokia N95 and I loved it. It was getting a little long in the tooth, so I was looking to replace it. I considered the iPhone but was convinced by someone not to get one but to stick with Nokia. So I purchased this phone. I have never been sorrier about a purchase in my life.The phone not only doesn't hold up next to the iPhone, it doesn't even do everything my old N95 did!No VIOP calls, No Slingbox player, No internet radio, ( all of which the iPhone and the N95 did )all you get is a touchscreen, but no decent software to run on it.I did however try to make the best of it. Until today when it had hung, and I had to power cycle it. Now it is just a lump of useless plastic, as it never came back from the reboot.And Nokia support requires you mail the device in for repairs ( at their discretion ), If I had an iPhone I could walk into any Apple store in the USA and get it serviced.Will I ever by a Nokia product again? Hell no. And please save yourself the aggravation and avoid this phone tool.I wish I had returned it the moment I got it, as now its 14 days too late to return it to Amazon.UPDATE 10/23/2009Well, I got it fixed, and put it up for sale on eBay. Its gone, and I now am the happy owner of the Apple iPhone.Guess what? The iPhone JUST WORKS, no messing about, everything works like a charm. What was I thinkingbuying the N97? Ok. as hardware went the n97 had much going for it. Pretty much everything the iphone had.What was the problem? The OS. The OS on the N97 was junk. Its almost like they weren't trying. If I wanted that experience, I would get a Microsoft phone. Now I see Nokia is suing Apple, maybe because Apple gets what customers want, a phone that is high tech and works."

Here are some of the issues I facea) The phone Freezes often requiring the battery to be removed to reset. This for me is a non starter as the widgets and software on the phone should not impede the phones basic functionality but rather enhance it.b) Applications are just not as numerous and ones that exist (Except Bloomberg) are of inferior quality vs similar iPhone/iTouch apps.c) GPS functionality is poor an took a number of software updates to get it to even workd) Phone seems to strangely run out of memory even though a lot is available, it does not seem to be able to load balance memory between partitions.e) Lastly, poor battery life. I cannot squeeze out a full day on while in a 3G networkAll in all it is a poor imitation of the iPhone and if one wants a device that just works and does not have to wait while nokia gets its act together get an iPhone or an Palm Pre.

Its fine until u start viewing large web pages heavy in flash and ads. Im typing this review from my n97 right now, it handles full desktop pages really well, no need for the mobile versions, but like i just said, pages requiring a lot of memory r slow and glitchy, an example is [...]...thats really the only place u'll c a lot of slowdown or lag. If u have multiple tabs/pages open it wont always have the memory to handle it and close the oldest tab without warning. It will randomly fall behind doing other things, but for the most part its quick. Keybooard is great, u'll get fast on it quick, its great. So is the touchscreen, very accurate and perfectly tuned sencitivity, u can draw easily, u can do some greatly detailed drawing w a stylus...but thats just 4 fun... Camera is pretty good, macro is amazing, best close ups ive ever seen on a phone. Video does great w motion, ya no 30 fps, but it doesnt blow up real well on a computer, not to clear, little grainier than i was hoping. Music sounds great. Fm transmitter works great. Does a great job w video playback, but could use better codec support."

This is their flagship??? She is ok with it but isn't very technical minded and doesn't tend to use it for much except calls. Call quality is terrible. FM Transmitter does NOT work. 32 Gig harddrive, yet you can only store a couple apps on the phone at a time. I absolutely abhor this phone, and yes I've done an update to the OS for her. BAD BAD BAD in almost every way. Shockingly bad in my opinion for the money spent! Better off with Blackberry, iPhone or Android. I have almost never given a bad review to a product bought from Amazon. But seriously, this is the worst product we've ever had the misfortune of spending over $500 on. Never again Nokia!"

Besides this inconvenience, the N97 is really a great phone with nice features and a much easier to use touchscreen when compared to the Iphone."
"277542","Nokia N97 Unlocked Phone, Touchscreen, 3G, 5 MP Camera, A-GPS, 32 GB, MicroSD Slot, and Integrated Ovi Applications--U.S. Version with Warranty (Black)",1,"I never thought I would hate a piece of technology, but the N97 phone changed everything. The N97 was a big disappointment from the very first moment of handling it. The battery cover refused to go on. After thirty minutes of failing and sore fingers, I started reading the manual. For god's sake, I shouldn't need to read the manual to put on a battery cover! The manual was of no help and I began to be violent with it until it was forced on. It has been downhill from there.The N97 is of an exceptional poor design; It looks common from the outside, and is garbage on the inside. Let me review each main function separately:1. Voice: The phone is awkward to hold and speak. The addition of a keyboard really makes it heavy and fat.2. Contacts: This is the WORST aspect of this phone. The phone RANDOMLY chooses when to display an incoming caller Id! All you get is a phone number, and good luck trying to remember which phone number belonged to whom in your contacts. I have had this phone for 5 months now and I still do not know how to fix this major issue. At first, I thought I needed to transfer all the SIM card contacts to the phone's memory contacts, but this did not work.3. Keyboard: The keyboard is not practical. You have to use shift keys for numbers and symbols. A shift key for a period or a colon. A shift key for a smiley face. A terrible Idea.4. Web: The web browser is slower than death, and unresponsive. At one point I almost cracked the screen while surfing from all the frustration. Once you access a web page it is another task to scroll down or sideways.5. GPS: if you are in a pickle or driving and need some quick help finding your way, then don't even consider the N97 as an option. The GPS does not lock onto a signal quickly, it takes the phone a minimum of 15 min to find a signal, and one time it took me 45 min!6. Applications: No good apps. There are applications for facebook, twitter and myspace. However, they are not enjoyable to use. If you have your N97 while among a group of iphone users you will be ashamed to show it off. You look at all those apple users play and laugh about the cool apps they have on their phone, while I am still wondering who is calling me, because this phone can't display the name from the contacts.7. Camera: the photos are OK, not great thought. The flash is a big waste of power, it gives those being pictured a sickly jaundiced look.I urge all who see this to NOT buy this phone, and to tell all their loved ones not to as well. I on the other hand am cursed with this abomination, this travesty of dysform and dysfunction, until I can afford another phone."

The phone is larger than the N95 and does indeed have a resistance based touchscreen. The touchscreen was he only thing I felt would make the N95 the best phone ever. However, with the N97 as you chat on the phone your face will activate items on your home screen, particularly an alarm setting.The phone did not come equipped with free symbian software for word, spreadsheets and abobe documents as the N95 did. That you had to pay $20 to download which was disappointing.The internet connection shifting from webpage to webpage is slow to load, even with a 3.5G network, it was very fast(moreso than my computer) on the N95 phone with a 3G network.Many of the features are hard to figure out without a manual and it is annoying to have the memory card inside the same compartment areas as the battery. Everytime you wish to remove the memory card you have to remove the backplate cover of the phone, instead of having a slot on the side of the phone. There are many icons whle connected to the internet and looking at your email that you have no clue what they mean unless you are used to seeing them. Lot of trial and error. Simply the N95 was easier to work with, more compact and lightwieght and came preinstalled with many items of use that I appreciated so the price was worth it.This N97 is too pricey for the lack of preinstalled full useful versions of symbian software."

"277556","Nokia N97 Unlocked Phone, Touchscreen, 3G, 5 MP Camera, A-GPS, 32 GB, MicroSD Slot, and Integrated Ovi Applications--U.S. Version with Warranty (Black)",1,"Before I write this review, some history. I used this phone for over 1 year, before this I owned a Nokia N95 for 2 years, a nokia 3650 for 4 years and a nokia 2260 before that. Needless to say, I was a big time Nokia fanboy. I was really impressed by Nokia's innovation, sturdiness of their phones and the ease of usability (and sleek designs some might say). That ofcourse changed after N97. I have one sentence that sums up this phone. It does a LOT of things but does not do anything well. I will go over each of its major components and tell why there is a problem: Camera: By far, the best feature of this phone. This is where Nokia did well. Unlike other phone manufacturers, they did not make a phone which also has a camera. They made a phone + camera. The lens is great and the resolution is great. The quality of pictures and all the available options makes it as close to a real camera as possible. However, I compare it to the camera on N95 and I am less than satisfied. The earlier camera was a lot more ergonomically stable and the lens cover was a lot nicer but I'm not going to complain too much about it. Still, the quality of images I get are a little less satisfactory than N95 and it didn't entirely replace my existing camera. I give it an 8/10Phone itself: The phone interface is really weird. Who sets automatic landscape setting on the phone itself? I go and try to answer a phone call and the bloody thing is trying to reset the orientation. So I have to wait before the image comes back on the phone. WTF! And then there is the connectivity. If for some reason I go out of network and then back in, there are chances it wont connect for a while. While my friend (who has the exact same carrier as me) is enjoying a conversation, I'm still waiting for a bloody signal. It is disappointing when the function like calling and receiving calls seamlessly should be the first thing the phone does. I give it 5/10Navigation: A new feature which was installed after I bought the phone. Good except its not very good when working offline. Kinda sucks when you go out of network. But some genius decided that a navigation software does not need a history! What? You mean I have to type the entire address everytime I add it? What if for some reason I accidentally exit? Re-type. What if I go there everyday? Re-type. Weird! And there is no bell or anything like normal navigation systems to warn you to turn now. Silly. 6/10Music player: First is the sync. If you transfer music via the mass memory feature then you wont see the songs in your list but if you sync them via the media sync feature then you will. I dont understand why there can't be one simple way to transfer everything. Why do you have to keep changing the mode? Also, if you push the back button on the song, guess what! It takes you back to the main phone screen! Hey! I only wanted to go back to the album! No sir! You cannot do that at all! Gets REALLY annoying especially if you are listening to music in the car. 5/10Touch and keyboard: The responsiveness of the touch screen is average. The touch keyboard is again a genius design. Why make the touch keyboard just like the old phones when you had to click on one key 4 times to type ""c"". Isn't that the point of the touch keyboard? The thing appears on a screen! Why not have all the letters of the alphabet there? Every other manufacturer does it. Why are you the only idiots who don't? And then you don't even give people the option. Why Why why? 3/10Memory and operating system: Wow! If there is anything that put the final nail on the coffin was this bit of the phone. Lets talk about the memory first. Nokia says the phone has 32GB memory. To be fair, that is true. If you want to transfer your music, pictures etc etc. Yes, it has 32GB of memory. What they however fail to mention is that there is something called a NAND memory. Which is only 64MB! What is this memory you ask? Why, its only the place where the entire operating system and most critical apps sit! Things like maps, push e-mail sit here. There is no way to transfer them to the mass memory as its called by Nokia. I wonder what the designers of this phone were thinking? In this day and age of all these apps that go on to smart phones, 64MB was going to be enough? You run out of memory very quickly and then are left to try and figure out ways to free up memory. It gets old really quickly and starts impacting your phone performance. The operating system is just the worst thing ever dreamt up. It has so many things wrong with it that I don't know where to begin. First off, finding any of the functions it does do is a full time job in itself. On top of that, it flashes a message every time you are out of network. You can't make it go away I have tried. No imagine you are receiving a call. Since my carrier does not have that capability, a message will flash while the call is coming in that data exchange is not possible. I know! Just let me answer the phone. Nope! It will flash that message for however long and then you can take your call. Combine that with the automatic landscape feature, voila! Its almost a second before you are allowed to answer your phone call. You are a bloody phone first! Let me get to my phone call! And the features like weather and e-mail widgets. Shouldn't they connect to the internet and retrieve your e-mails automatically? They do. For the first 30 mins and then stop doing it. If God forbid you get disconnected from network for some reason, the connection aint coming back unless you start it manually. Genius. Oh yeah, and the phone software crashes a LOT! Requiring a restart almost every day. 0/10Ovi store: When I bought this phone, I knew it wasn't an iphone so I wasn't expecting the app store but it should still work right? Here is my experience, I tried downloading an app and paid for it like a responsible consumer but there was an error while downloading. Guess what happened, it couldn't find my app. THere was no way I could go back and re-download it because it wasn't there! I tried contacting the OVI store. There was no phone number listed. So I e-mailed them. It took them a week to get back to me and they weren't able to understand my problem. How hard is it to send me a link to enable me to re-download the app? I am not trying to get it for free. I've already paid for it (my card was charged). Finally I get someone on the phone who tries to blame my network for it and sends me a download link which I have to use in the next 3 hours or it will disappear. I used the same link over my network without any issues. The problem was with OVI store. (Its even a lame name to be honest). There are a bunch of free apps too which are tried. They are all bad. 2/10Other complaints: I have ranted a lot here and I hope people read this and stay away from this phone. Frankly, I am done for life with Nokia products. I read things about their new n900 phone and saw similar issues with it. Here are some more issues I encountered. 1) My charging port broke. Now the only way the phone will charge is if I put it at a certain angle and connect it to my PC. Wouldn't help if I were travelling now would it? I think its past its warranty period so no point contacting anyone. 2) The mini-SD card is just plain hard to use. The card doesn't pop out all the way so you are left trying to pry the card using your finger nails praying it doesn't break anything. All in all, shows how bad the design is. Whatever was good about Nokia was destroyed by this phone. I paid $650 for this phone and I don't think its unreasonable at that price to expect that stuff works. Not only did it not but the things about Nokia like sturdiness, innovation, design etc that I mentioned earlier, are absent. I am thru with Nokia for good and want to warn everyone before buying a Nokia as it seems they don't want to test their products anymore"

I have till date not seen any software freeze and can work on multiple apps at the same time. I am not a person who is always stuck to the phone for checking emails, face-book but use it while travelling to listen to music, reading pdf or playing games and I can perform more than 2 tasks easily without any issues. The camera is awesome and this was one of the important criteria I went for the N97 instead of the iPhone.Loading music in the cell phone is a cake walk and not to forget the FM that is available. Since I did not have an iPhone, I got used to the resistive touch screens and double clicks for opening the apps even though some of the reviews do mention this as a problem. Keeping the price in mind, Nokia should have included the pdf reader and office for free instead of having it to download from [...] for a fee. All in all the phone comes in with load of features at a price, but I guess if you manage to get an unlocked iPhone, you would probably paying the same price. Lesson learnt..always wait for couple of months for the product to stabilize and then go for the purchase."

I was willing the N97 to have a serious gadget, computer and entertainment all in one device. Now i am happy that i made a good decision. The only thing i am facing right now is that there are little apps designed to the 5th edition Symbian OS. I have to recommend the quickoffice great application which gave me the oportunity to transfer my adobe and quickoffice licenses to this edition. The other problem is the battery, i thought nokia was going to fix the duration but it's better to purchase more batteries or i recommend better the new and updated cradle from boxwave. Nokia N97 Desktop Cradle (With Spare Battery Charger) The qwerty keyboard is so great that when you combine the autocomplete option you obtain great productiviy. I'm so happy with the design, but i'm so concerned that the Symbian OS isn't so develop like others, but the multitasking feature is what ended taking my final decision.

Sure it has a few glitches and bugs, but have already done two firmware updates and most of these seem to have been ironed out. What piece of technology doesn't have weak points? The only thing that is a little off seems to be the signal strength. I live in a marginal area and it doesn't seem to be as good as previous phones. Call quality is good. In saying that it has improved slightly since the updates. GPS is a little slow acquiring the satellites, but this also is better (not perfect).The one issue everyone seems to worry about is the qwerty keypad. I can assure you that once you get the hang of it, it is simple to use, and it seems that it was designed well. Once you learn the shortcuts it is pretty fast to type on.Battery doesn't last very long - but what do you expect when you are running all the features non-stop and constantly opening it up to play on it - because it is a cool phone.I recommend this phone to anyone.

For videos and photos N97 is as good as N95 (very good), except for the len cover in the N97, that eliminates my worries about damages in it. GPS features are identical in both machines, but I perceived better results in my N97 I guess because of the processor speed (loading maps, etc).In terms of storage capacity, 8GB of the N95 was enough for me, but 32GB in the N97 is even better.Finally, I've read some articles related to the dilemma in the market of touch-screen only vs touchscreen+keyboard in smart phones.

I find myself regularly waiting for pages to load rather than reading what is already loaded.) Also, even when loaded pages don't scroll around very well.6. The software availability is much less than I expected. Maybe I'm just bad with google, but it seems like most the programs I want are from the US. And US developers seem to develop in this order: 1. iphone 2. blackberry 3. windows mobile. They just don't develop for s60. For some reason I can never fine the European equivalent of the programs I want. Also, very few programs seem to have been updated from s60v3 to s60v5 so even if someone HAS done the software, it doesn't necessarily work on this phone. That includes most of nokia's own software.7. Battery life is not enough to make it through an entire day if you're using it regularly throughout the day. It'll make it if you leave it in your pocket while you're at work, but if you leave it on your desk, (say because work blocks all the websites you want to visit), you better plan to have it plugged in the whole time.8. The call log stopped recording so I can't see who called me any more.9. I have to leave it on vibrate so it doesn't ring at work yet can rarely actually feel it ring. I don't know if it's not vibrating or just so week I can't tell but I miss 100% of the calls I get when I'm not looking directly at it.10. The phone app does not interact well with any other app so you'll likely screw up a call if you're in an app when you get it. Alternately I regularly have trouble actually hanging up. I don't think the red button on the bezel works the same as the ""end call"" soft button.11. It takes at least 3 clicks to do basically anything whether it's run a program, view a contact or pick who to send a text message to. nothing is well laid out.Minor issues:1. All the configuration options are buried, obscured or unavailable. It's a hunt to try and configure anything.2. The Facebook app requires 2 clicks just to tell it 'yes you can connect to the internet' every time you open it. (This is pretty consistent. Everything wants your personal interaction to tell it how to connect to the internet. This is easy: if available, use wifi, if not use cellular. With AT&T there are another 2 or 3 options I don't even understand.)3. The Facebook app stopped loading pictures.4. It doesn't come with a password keeper and all the options are mediocre on this phone. (There are 3 or 4 options but none I consider acceptable. I could do an entire post on whats wrong with the different password keeper options.)5. Ovi Store doesn't let you re-download programs. It knows you've bought them but it won't let you reload them.6. The podcast program doesn't automatically download your podcasts in the background and it doesn't save your spot in them. (However, I found out if you play the podcasts through the music player it will save your spot as long as you don't play anything else in between.)7. The screen does not redraw well8. The music player is mediocre at best. It seems I have to dig down to the song just to play anything. I'd like to hit 'play' and have some random song play. This is an acceptable player for maybe 2 or 3 years ago. Today people expect a reasonably thought out interface.9. The rss reader is built into the web browser and has to be dug down to. Why can't I just hit an RSS app and have my RSS's, updated, at my fingertips?10. Ok, I know below I throw a bone to the keyboard, but it's quirky. I regularly hit the 'right' key on the d-pad when trying to type which sends my cursor to the front of the text, (where I then type half a sentence before realizing it). Also, I regularly confuse the 3 'alt' keys, (which you'll use regularly). This slows me down and causes me to retype a lot. Also, I'll get an 'alt' key locked in place and type a whole sentence in numbers and symbols.11. Just can't find a reasonable game for it. I just want a simple RPG to keep me busy when I don't have a cellular connection but can't find one that will install.12. The cut and paste are very poorly implemented.That said, it's not a completely terrible phone1. In general, all the hardware is good. They've got a decent platfrom, their just abusing it with terrible software.2. I get a TON of use out of the 32gb of memory. It's just like having a 32GB memory stick with you as long as you've got the cable.3. I like podcasts on my phone. If the software was a bit better it'd be perfect. I let them download in the background and then play them in my car whenever I drive, (and all things considered and morning addition aren't on).4. At least it can kinda sync. It brought over my exchange contacts and calendar. That is pretty nice though I'm not sure it's actually sync'ing changes backwards.5. I like the integration between the GPS, the Nokia 'locations' program, google maps, etc. There's even a program to GPS tag your photos.6. The camera takes great photos and reasonable video. Qik is cool for streaming/sharing video online.7. The keyboard isn't bad inherently. The keys are definitely ok to type on.8. Size and feel of the phone are pretty good. The flip up is great.9. The widgets are nice though I don't use the facebook (I had it up for a bit but I never really cared about anything it was showing me) or the weather (the weather has a solid background which is an ugly contrast to most other widgets that are semi-transparent) widgets.10. It makes a great modem for a laptop, whether as a wifi access point or as a tethered modem. That said, I wish the hardware supported WPA because, being at DEFCON this week, WEP is just asking someone to crack it.Hope this helps others avoid a very expensive mistake. I'll probably try and sell it on ebay and go back to my 8800 while I wait for AT&T to get the HTC Touch Pro 2. I just hope it's not crippled in some way."
"277568","Nokia N97 Unlocked Phone, Touchscreen, 3G, 5 MP Camera, A-GPS, 32 GB, MicroSD Slot, and Integrated Ovi Applications--U.S. Version with Warranty (Black)",2,"First, let me say that I've been a user of S60 devices for years now. I even had that awful 3650 with its goofball round keypad. Off the top of my head, I've had and used 3650, 6620, 6682, 9500, 9300, E61, E70, E50, E51, E61i, E65, E71, N73, N82, N95 and the ill-fated N97. I even had a 5800XM for half a day, but returned it when I found that the 3G capabilities were hopelessly borked. Fortunately for those users it got fixed, but I never did jump back in on the 5800XM.Back to the N97 though. Crazy version number jumps aside (I read something about 4 being considered an unlucky number in some Asian cultures, so they skipped from S60v3 to v5), I was jazzed about the N97. Under the hood, the Symbian underpinnings that I've grown to know & love over the years, with a slick new touch interface. I even went to the launch party in NYC. That commercial with LL Cool J had me humming ""Mama Said Knock You Out"" so much in my head that I went and bought the song from iTunes.Then I got the phone, retiring my N82. Cue the sad music. First problem - no iSync support. At all. No worries, been there before. I hacked together an N95 plugin back in the day, so how hard should it be? Bzzz.. No go. My method of sync on the device was using Mail for Exchange with Google Sync to sync up contacts & calendar events. It worked mostly, but was a bit of a pain to set it all up. To get the data to the phone, it's My Mac -> Google -> Phone. Of course, that's 2 different 2-way syncs, so there's always potential to have change collisions at the Google part of the equation.Next up - battery life. Wow. It's not iPhone-bad, but it's pretty bad. I will take my hat off to the boys from Espoo on one point here - Micro-usb charging. It's about time, kids. Seriously. Keep that up.The CPU and available memory felt a bit anemic. Not as much CPU as I'd thought would be the case - out of memory was a common message I saw. Definitely slower than I'd have liked, so I must also say the CPU is definitely not up to snuff.The screen. Oh the screen. It's certainly beautiful to look at, no disputing that. I thought the colors were vibrant and looked great. I was concerned that a touchscreen would mean it would be hard to see anything from finger marks, but not so here. My chief problem with the device, which ultimately led me to return it was the screen. The resistive touchscreen employed on the N97 just wasn't sensitive enough. I found myself doing 3 or 4 touches when one should have sufficed.The camera. 5 MP, dual LED flash. It took very nice pics, but why not use a single xenon flash? The flash on the N82 is the best I've ever seen on a phone.I really really tried so hard to like this phone, but between the screen that didn't really seem to work correctly and the < 1 day battery life, I couldn't in good conscience keep it."

I would be the first to say that it has some issues that should be solved by future firmware updates.(kinetic scrolling throughout, ram issues) I'm by no means a power user. This phone accomplishes everything I need it to do and also gives me options to do some fun stuff as well. I'm a Nokia phone guy. I grabbed the N97 and was up in running in no time. The os is very familar. Some would say that this old and boring. I say that this is a major selling point. I don't want to learn everything over again just because I'm getting a new phone. It's great being able to listen music, check my email, and chat with my wife. I love the camera. This is a major selling point to me because most phones have crappy cameras. The Fm transmitter is also a plus to me. I've used that feature more than I can count. The touch screen is very usable. I wish they would have included a virtual qwerty keyboard. I use the virtual T9 keyboard often and I must say that it is great. The physical keyboard takes alittle getting used to but within days I was typing without much effort. In closing I would say that this phone is great. If you are looking for an Iphone killer this isn't in the same boat as the Iphone. If you are on the fence on buying this phone go ahead you will not be diappointed."

It doesnt get 5 stars because of the battery."
"277575","Nokia N97 Unlocked Phone, Touchscreen, 3G, 5 MP Camera, A-GPS, 32 GB, MicroSD Slot, and Integrated Ovi Applications--U.S. Version with Warranty (Black)",2,"I've got a BlackBerry Bold, as well as an iPhone 3G. I'm not writing this review exclusively for comparing the N97 side-by-side, but given the price of this phone, the bar is set reasonably high. Obviously, nothing's really ""as good as"" a BlackBerry when it comes to e-mail (and you're using a BES), and nothing available right now is ""as good as"" an iPhone when it comes to web browsing or application availability. So for reference, those weren't taken in to consideration.The N97 arrives in a very nice package, with a pre-charged battery and thoughtfully written manual. The included software doesn't run on OS X, so I spent very limited time working with it.Within a couple of minutes of receiving the box, I threw my SIM card in and the phone was happily asking for some settings. What impressed me immediately, is that the N97 seemed to know exactly how to configure itself for data and MMS services. This is the first unbranded phone I've used that didn't need me to enter the settings for my carrier (AT&T).The N97 almost instantly showed a strong 3.5G signal, and started filling the home screen with information. I placed a couple of test calls, and was extremely impressed with the sound quality. Without question, this is one of the best sounding wireless phones I've ever used.And then, the wheels started to come off...First task: sync my work mail, contacts, and calendars via ActiveSync.This started out reasonably easy, until I realized about halfway through the wizard that I had entered a setting incorrectly. Unfortunately, once you have something in the wizard, it's there. There's no ""Back"" button. So, the Mail For Exchange program started complaining immediately.""No problem"" I thought, I'll just change the settings. This turned out to be far more convoluted than it should be. ""Options"" doesn't give you a path to the settings. You have to go to hit the silver button, then go to Applications, then go to the ""MfE"" folder (which is incredibly cryptic, if you don't know what you're looking for) to change the settings.Once I had them changed, the N97 happy started grabbing everything I wanted from my Exchange server. I went back in to Options and saw some well thought out options, like setting ""prime time"" for a constant sync, and a schedule for when you don't need instant access. There were also options for setting Out of Office notifications, and the overall experience was quite good.Second task: set up my personal e-mail account.Having used the wizard already, this was straightforward. The program asked if I wanted to connect to get my mail, and I confirmed that I did. Mail showed up, and all was good. Until I tried to leave the program. That's when I learned that the N97 is apparently incapable of maintaining two mail connections.Annoyed, but willing to accept this limitation, I tried to put the account on my home screen, along with my Exchange account. Apparently, the N97 can't do this, either. You can have one mail box on the screen, regardless of the number of mail accounts you may be using.Third task: connect with my Bluetooth speakerphone.My car has a Bluetooth speakerphone. Since I can remember Bluetooth being a feature on wireless phones, Nokia seems to have dominated this space by including just about every Bluetooth profile under the sun. Pairing the N97 wasn't a problem. After it was set up, I made a couple of calls (which again, had awesome clarity) and thought everything was fine. Until...When I returned to my car later in the day, I noticed that calls weren't being directed to the speakerphone. As it turns out, the N97 won't re-pair with anything on its own. So while I could use the speakerphone with my Bold and iPhone without doing anything at all, the N97 requires you to hit the silver button, then go to Setup, then Connectivity, then Bluetooth, then Paired Devices, then pick the speakerphone, then hit ""pair"" every time.Speaking of which...Fourth Task: answer the stupid phone.I'm not 100% sure this is even possible with the N97. When the phone rings, you have a large bar with an arrow that points to nothing, and is labeled ""Answer"". If you tap it, nothing happens. If you hit the green button, nothing. If you unlock the phone and try either, nothing.Feeling like a complete moron, I had to look it up. It turns out, the bars are sliders, similar to the Unlock slider on an iPhone. Yet, this is really the ONLY thing in the OS that acts like an iPhone.Fifth Task: get Facebook working.This wasn't difficult at all. Enter your name and password, and go. The application looks similar to the BlackBerry version, which I happened to like more than the iPhone version.It does just about everything you'd expect it to, until it crashes. Yes, that's right. Until it crashes. Constantly. Sometimes it does a full ""I'm kicking you back to the home screen"" crash, and other times, you get a red box telling you that your phone needs to be restarted. Sometimes the red box goes away on its own. There's really no rhyme or reason to it.Sixth Task: read my e-mail.Well... on the first try, I had a message that said my phone was out of memory. You see, despite having 32GB of storage for music and movies, the amount of memory your phone can actually use for programs is quite limited. The out of memory message suggested closing other applications, which I did, and which resolved nothing. Rebooting the phone worked.That's when I discovered that the N97 is actually quite awful at rendering mail that isn't plain text.That's also where I started to give up on the N97. In between all of this, I also discovered that:*Your choices for incoming message alerts are either at the same volume as your ringer, or disabled.*Some things need to be double-tapped, others single-tapped, with little indication as to which is which.*The Ovi Store is basically a kludgy mess.*The keyboard will constantly register any key that you so much as brush your finger next to when typing.*There is virtually no connection between what the battery display chooses to tell you, and how much battery life you actually have.*The N97 is basically a hopeless mess of a phone.Admittedly, there are some bright spots:*The back camera takes surprisingly good pictures.*The included weather application is actually pretty cool, since it uses GPS and updates often.*The overall build quality of the phone is quite good.And sure, there are a boatload of hacks and tweaks you can make to the phone to get it to do things closer to what you want. But in my estimation, the amount of research and effort to do so is unreasonable, given this phone's cost.I've also heard that a new software update is imminent (as of this review, the most recent version available for this phone is 12.0.24), so that may solve some problems. But with the N900 not costing substantially more and a release date ""any day now"", the N97 is for Symbian fans only."
"277576","Nokia N97 Unlocked Phone, Touchscreen, 3G, 5 MP Camera, A-GPS, 32 GB, MicroSD Slot, and Integrated Ovi Applications--U.S. Version with Warranty (Black)",1,"I am a Nokia customer and enthusiastic for over a decade. In the recent past, I have lectured a lot to anyone on how N95 (my previous cell phone) was far better than iPhone. Finally, I've waited anxiously for N97 release since it was announced until I bought my own piece in Amazon, by the opportunity of a friend's trip to USA, because I live in Brazil.The phone handling is quite good, but lacks a lot of functionality and intuitive commands you find in iPhone, but so far so good. It irritated me a lot the constant auto-reset ""obsession"" shown by N97, but I looked to me as an issued to be fixed in next firmware. It was sooo frustrating when I had to configure my e-mail account more than 3 times because it simply disappeared from my phone without any trace...When I was just getting used with all N97 peculiarities and handling, just listening to some music (with no other application running simultaneously), I tapped on the playing song's name and tried to add it to a specific playlist and the phone just froze... and showed the same froze image for over an hour, until I decided to take off the battery and reset it by force, since the hard reset (hitting 3 buttons) wasn't working at all.Well, ever since my phone did not work anymore. Whenever I start it up, it stops and freezes at the white page with Nokia logo. Not even the start-up song is played... In a desperate measure, I left it ""thinking"" alone for over 7 hours, but it didn't revive. Plugging it to a computer and exchanging batteries also did not work.Left it in a Nokia authorized tech support, but they just returned it to me with its death sentence, since it would be necessary to replace the mother board...Now, I'm trying contact with Nokia and Amazon for over 5 days, but still no response from none of them. I think they are going to just turn their backs to me...That's why I am buying tomorrow the new iPhone 3GS 32GB, a more reliable and fancy phone. Why I didn't buy it ealier? Because iPhone did not have video camera and still does not have a true GPS with navigation. Guess what? N95 showed me how it sucks to be trying to reach somewhere and someone calls you... It's annoying. That's why I'll buy also a dedicated GPS, which will certainly work better than N95, N97 and iPhone all together.PLEASE BE SMART AND DON'T BUY N97 AND ANY OTHER NOKIA CELL PHONE.Leandro Armani"

I wanted a Nokia smartphone so badly that I couldn't wait for the n900. However this will be my last Nokia product. Best said on the forums ""$700 and you too can become a beta tester for Nokia."" I spent a month trying to workaround all the bugs and kinks. The second firmware upgrade did help in that the charger stopped draining the battery and crashes were much more rare. I never got the hang of answering the phone and touching the device without setting off the camera proved imposable. Then the screen broke at day 31. Nokias support has taken a nose dive and told me it would be a month to check it out. However I found a workaround with recalibrating the screen. Sick of the bugs I gave it away to someone who's HTC phone broke. His opinion toned down my hatred of this phone saying it's a great phone for free but paying for the phone makes the quality unacceptable.Pros.-With the warranty GPS upgrade OVI maps 3.0 is fantastic. It stores locally and replaces the need for a Garmin when on buiness trips.- With the warranty lens cover upgrade the camera takes pictures beyond any other phone.- If you delete all the stock apps and reinstall on the 32 gig phone area the multi tasking is flawless beating all other phones hands down.- Once you figure out how to configure the setting the applications are very professional and reliable.- Battery life is vastly superior to other smart phones but not what one has grow accustom to in Nokia.Cons- Quality control has taken a nose dive. It is only beta at best.- Customer support is useless and on the att bad level- Need to sent the phone to Nokia for upgrades.- No t-mobile 3G support- The notifications are too common and awkward ie loud painful beep in your ear telling you the data is not active when dialing on a GSM based network.- Answering is a nightmare. There is a magic combo of lock keys sliding arrows and button presses. I never answer on time.- They throw the camera in your face it is very annoying to always press away from the video call option.- Lots of dead batteries with pictures of you answering the phone and inside of your pocket - There is a wide array of activities that stop the charging process.- poor touch screen response- None standard USB cable-n900 is much better."

For starts, the phone presents constant lock ups and memory loss requiring hard reset (having to take out the batrery and memory card for the unit to start up). Lock ups are most noticeable when the phone memory (ram) is low, even though no widgets or programs running the phone eats up ram by itself, and you receive a phone call. Right after hanging up the phone locks ups and have to go throught the whole process of reseting the phone. Options for the different screens are hard to acces since have to go through several menues to get to them. The camera lens is very prone to scratches, taking night pictures is basically unusable due to the flash being reflected from the scratches of the lens. Key pad feedback is basically not there, keys have no real sence of travel. The phone is under powered, there is a very noticeable lag between screen selection of a program and actualy opening of the program, screen rotation is slow to the point were you have to shake the phone to make it realise that you wish to go to portrait mode or back to landscape. Overall I personally do not recomend the phone, specially for the price of the unit. There are a lot of other phones that even though, might have less functionality, work a lot better and are less frustrating to use then this unit. Support from Nokia is lacking, not very helpfull when you finally are able to contact them.Overall a very disapointing experience, leaves you feeling as if your were ripped of for paying a premium price for a substandard so called phone."

"277587","Nokia N97 Unlocked Phone, Touchscreen, 3G, 5 MP Camera, A-GPS, 32 GB, MicroSD Slot, and Integrated Ovi Applications--U.S. Version with Warranty (Black)",2,"I ordered this phone from Amazon assuming that I am getting the right phone as I am used to Palm lines of phone with both Qwerty and touch screen phones and I wanted an unlocked one with the same function. There were issues with Nokia. They shipped with a wrong battery type which even after full 4-5 hours of charging, would discharge the moment I disconnected from the charger and did an ON/OFF. I called Nokia USA customer service 2-3 times and they didnt even bother to call me back even after a week.Then the address book search is not very user friendly as the search on firstname or last name is not bringing out the correct match. In all, those who need a real qwerty kb and touch screen phone, this may not be the right choice - Atleast it wasnt for me. I decided to return the phone to Amazon for a full refund."

My only complaint about it is that the web browser could be better. A few sites like Google Wave will not render correctly and other times the browser will just crash out and bring me back to the home screen."
"277593","Nokia N97 Unlocked Phone, Touchscreen, 3G, 5 MP Camera, A-GPS, 32 GB, MicroSD Slot, and Integrated Ovi Applications--U.S. Version with Warranty (Black)",5,"I just got my N97 phone few days ago and I'm already enjoying the everything about the phone. Its fast, it responds very well to touch. One of the great thing about the phone is the double clicking. It means you can open/select what you really wish to open instead of mistaken opening something else because you touched the wrong part of the screen.Well, with the problems all other people are having with the phone, my advice for people buying this is that:As soon as you buy the phone, before you install, copy or enter any contacts, calender or even do anything. Just put your SIM card in the phone and go to the Nokia PC Suite to upgrade to the latest firmware. That was exactly what I did and its working great."
"277594","Nokia N97 Unlocked Phone, Touchscreen, 3G, 5 MP Camera, A-GPS, 32 GB, MicroSD Slot, and Integrated Ovi Applications--U.S. Version with Warranty (Black)",3,"I was looking to switch from my Blackberry to another Smart phone that I thought could handle my daily requirements (I'm what you would call a power user). I paid almost $600.00 for the phone and consequently had high expectations. I had the phone for one day and realized at the end of the day this definitely wasn't the phone for me. The software was very unstable and if you haven't used the Symbian Interface before, it is not as intuitive as other smart phones. I'm not exagerrating when I say the phone for whatever reason froze up while being used at least 3 times an hour. I would have to remove the battery and put it back in to get the phone working again and this was the ultimate deal breaker. The fact that I couldn't browse the internet or perform basic functions on such an expensive smartphone convinced me to return the phone the very same day. Amazon.com offered spectacular customer service and I was immediately given a refund. Hope other buyers have a better experience than I did but for me, I'm back to my Blackberry Bold 9000 and waiting for the Blackberry Bold 9700 to go on sale at Amazon.com..."

"277596","Nokia N97 Unlocked Phone, Touchscreen, 3G, 5 MP Camera, A-GPS, 32 GB, MicroSD Slot, and Integrated Ovi Applications--U.S. Version with Warranty (Black)",4,"I made a lot of research before ordering this phone. Saw all the pros and against in many sites and based my decision upon them since I didn't know anybody who had it. I was willing to spend some money so I tried to choose carefully. My main driven was the physical qwerty keypad, updated technologies and the large screen. The N97 fulfilled them (except for the size of the letters in the keypad where Nokia did it again - TOO SMALL for people above the 40!). It's nicely built, very powerful and rich in specifications so I guess it covers almost every possible need with its 3G, GPS, bluetooth, WiFi, qwerty keyboard, touchscreen, SD slot, excellent camera, etc but I am afraid I (or it) was not prepared to deal with too many technologies put together. The system is not fast enough to manage them all and probably because of my anxiety it had actually frozen and had to be restarted twice in one week using it. I also fail to recognize the logic behind the menu tree, probably my fault as well.I still have a lot to learn and explore, since, as I said, it's a very resourceful machine. So, while I do not intend to give up, I am a bit disappointed with the so waited phone but, having experienced the only competitor for most of my needs, the Iphone, and being unable to deal with its touchscreen keypad, bottom line, it is still the best choice for me so far."
"277597","Nokia N97 Unlocked Phone, Touchscreen, 3G, 5 MP Camera, A-GPS, 32 GB, MicroSD Slot, and Integrated Ovi Applications--U.S. Version with Warranty (Black)",3,"On paper, it has everything that you would expect from a $600 phone (its available for $529 now), but its only when one starts using it that all the software shortcomings come to light.5 MP Photo Camera - great quality photos, but flash leaves a clear white mark on photos when used at night. I keep it turned off unless absolutely needed.Video camera - video quality is better than when i take video on my Sony 8.1mp digicam32GB internal memory - limitless space, but some apps dont install on this memory, instead defaulting to the phone memory(which is already very small). So whats the point of so much space, when it cant be used for proper management.Email software - doesnt support HTML; cant set unique notification tones for different email account, so when a new mail arrives and a person has 5 email acc setup, they will have to browse through all 5 Inboxes to see which one has the new emailBrowser - satisfactory;Battery - satisfactory; lasts more than a day with average usage.Google Apps/Facebook/Youtube - not satisfactory at all; facebook crashes all the time(I have finally uninstalled it), GMail app doesnt notify of new mails like it does on Blackberry; Google Maps has great interface, but I loose connection all the time when I am out of my wifi range.Multi-tasking - good feature and works well as long as all phone memory is not used up!Am waiting to download the v2.0 firmware upgrade that is being so much talked about. Hopefully it will fix the software issues."

"277600","Nokia N97 Unlocked Phone, Touchscreen, 3G, 5 MP Camera, A-GPS, 32 GB, MicroSD Slot, and Integrated Ovi Applications--U.S. Version with Warranty (Black)",4,"So far I like it, it's very stable for the most part but ocasionally it has issues with connecting to the net, this might be due to the phone or due to the fact that the at&t network in my small town has been neglected last 6 years and barely works. it tends to drop calls easily but overall is pretty good. also it doesn't get nearly as good of signal as a blackberry in low signal areas. it does require quite a bit of fiddling to get some of the settings the way you like but overall it's very easy to use, I love the 32 gigs of internal memory, provides lots of space for apps and music, the video quality on the phone is also very good but the format support is limited. the camera is exceptional, it takes extremely clear crisp images and the video quality when using in video mode isn't bad either. the second camera for video chat is of poor quality, it's not good for making pictures but it is perfect for what it's ment for, video calling.some questions I had about the phone when I ordered it I would like to provide answers for in case others have same question.first off, the phone has several types of memory avalible, your ram, which is required to run programs, it's got quite a bit for a phone but I think it could use more. second is the phone memory, I'm not sure how much is avalible total, never bothered to check, but I believe it's around 40-60 megabytes. this is the primary location you'll install most of your applications. the third area of memory is the 32 gigs of storage space, you can store anything in it and even install more programs here, please note not all applications will run properly from this memory, but most do. be careful about installing apps that are always running into this memory, cause when you plug the phone into your computer in mass storage mode, this memory is not accessable to your phone and apps running from it will run into problems. the same is true for the last area of memory, micro sd cards. insert any size you want up to 16 gigs and you have just that much more storage added to your phone. works just like the 32 gig memory, you can put apps or whatever on it, same thing about apps that run all the time in background applies to cards too. also some older apps will only recognize the first memory card device, the 32 gig memory looks like a card to most apps. meaning many older apps will see it, but will not see the sd card. this is a limitation of the older apps, not the phone.the gps reciever in the phone isn't very good, it takes a long time to get a lock and looses signal pretty easy, but it does work and works well enough to get the job done.I can't tell you how good 3g is on it, I do not live in area with 3g coverage, but edge is decent, that is, when I'm away from home, edge network here creeps at about 2kbs, it used to be much much faster but at&t neglected the network and it's gotten very slow and unreliable in past few years.problems I've found with the device is sometimes the os will get unstable, it's rare, but when it happens you'll just have to reset the phone in most cases, there is two methods to reset, one is to dial a code, the other is to hold a combo of keys while turning it on. I know both work as I've tried both, however I can't remember them of hand, google can help. the back doesn't seem well made to me, but it's held on rather well so maybe it's a little stronger than it appears. there is one app, accuweather that comes on the phone, I've had issues with this app from the start, it rarely works, recomendations on fixes or a better app is welcome. often times the phone will have issues connecting to the net, for no reason whatsoever the web browser will keep giving connection errors, most people have recomended powering the phone on and off to get it to reconnect. I found a quicker way that usually works. exit your browser and go to home screen, hold the end call button till it asks if you want to end data connections, answer yes, relaunch browser. works nearly everytime but sometimes you still have to resort to restarting the phone.overall my thoughts on the device are it's worth the money. most of the problems it has are fixed with the current firmware update, there are still a few lingering problems I hope the 2.0 update coming out will fix. but for someone who wants a decent media phone with lots of space, it's definately worth the money."

"277602","Nokia N97 Unlocked Phone, Touchscreen, 3G, 5 MP Camera, A-GPS, 32 GB, MicroSD Slot, and Integrated Ovi Applications--U.S. Version with Warranty (Black)",3,"I absolutely hate touch screens, yet I bought this phone.Why?This is a question for Nokia: if other people hate touch screens like I do--and they do--why do you think they'd buy the N97 with its inferior resistive touch screen over the iPhone's superior capacitive screen?Here's the reason: FULL QWERTY KEYBOARD.So when you make a phone with a ""full qwerty keyboard,"" and then you omit a dedicated row of numbers, it's not really a full qwerty keyboard now, is it? I come from a long line of QWERTY Nokia phones such as the 6820/6822, E70 and the Nokia E90 before this. The E90 has a full keyboard, complete with ctrl key so you can do seemingly simple things like copy (ctrl+c) and paste (ctrl+v). With my Nokia E90, typing was a breeze. You could even skip between words in sentences while typing text messages by holding ctrl and pressing left or right like you can in Windows (or even highlighting those words by pressing ""shift"").So imagine my disappointment when it took me a full minute of hunting through menus to forward a contact's phone number to someone via text message. Short of looking up the number, writing it down on a piece of paper, then typing it back, there's no other way to do this. What was a simple task on E90 and E70 (simply click options on the contact and it takes you to a sub-menu where you can copy the phone number into your clipboard), is an unwieldy chore on the N97. Here's how to copy a phone number to your clipboard: Contacts->Click on the contact->Options->Edit->Click on the phone number->Options->Editing Options->Copy->Start->Drag your finger across the number->Click Done. Absurd! And Lord knows how to paste it once you have it on your clipboard (you can only paste in apps that support the ""Editing Options"" submenu, so forget about pasting information in forms and menus on the phone for a quick lookup). I've scoured the Internet and there's simply no way to do this.Nokia has literally reduced functionality on this phone.Also, I can't stress enough how annoying it is to have to shift to type numbers, and to have to shift to type a comma. Are you kidding me? Commas are (or should be) the most used punctuation, up there with the period. Nokia's choice to make you shift to get a comma is dumbfounding.About the apps:-----------------Browser: the browser is frustratingly stupid. In older Nokia phones, you could simply type shortcuts while browsing 1 = enter URL, 2 = search, 3 = reload, 5 = switch between windows, etc. They removed this functionality from the browser. Why?! It's so annoying I could punch a vase. Why did you remove functionality that you had before, Nokia? Why? Nice one.-Facebook widget is okay; mostly sizzle, little steak. The presentation is nice, and it updates pertinent information, but you can only scroll through 20 or so entries in the live feed. There's no way to go trawling through a day or two of updates like you can by simply pointing your browser to the mobile version of Facebook.-Amazon app: throw it away. It's little more than a mobile front page that literally takes you to browsing on Amazon's mobile site.-AP News: does what it's supposed to. Video quality was good, news is what you'd expect from AP. Fairly functional app.-Guitar Rock Tour (like Guitar Hero): boring and unresponsive on the touch screen.. you have to tap too hard to register a click, so it slows the gameplay down and is exhausting to play.-AccuWeather: fairly accurate weather forecasts, though typing ""weather [zip]"" in Google seems to give more accurate results (AccuWeather seems to return results for the city you're in, but in a large coastal city like Los Angeles for example, a few miles can make a big difference).Usability:-----------There's a volume control button on the side that pivots up or down, and it only seems to work on calls. Since the buttons are there anyway, why not put them to use by allowing users to scroll up or down through menu items or web pages? Dragging around on the touch screen is frustratingly inaccurate and a chore.-There's a nice lock button on the side of the phone that seems fairly responsive (you can lock/unlock with a flick of your thumb). It did occasionally leave the screen black when I unlocked. I've updated to the latest firmware and haven't noticed the issue since, but it's disconcerting when it happens.-Exiting applications is TORTURE. In other Nokia phones, it's fairly easy to exit (just click the menu item, press up and it takes you to the bottom of the menu to exit). Or simply press the red ""hang up"" button and it will exit most apps. Not here. Pressing the red button does nothing (it only takes you to the home page). So before you know it, you have 20 different apps running in the background, all hogging up memory.-When you enter a sub-menu like the one for choosing symbols by pressing the ""Sym"" button on the keyboard, it's impossible to exit this menu. You have to choose a symbol, even if it's one you don't want, and then erase the symbol you chose. This underscores how poorly thought out the usability is.-Typing while in touch screen mode requires you to use a 10-key pad like on a traditional cell phone, and doesn't allow you to type using a full on-screen keyboard. This is so incredibly stupid that I almost vomited.Anyway, the phone has some pluses, such as the 5 MP camera, good 3G support, good storage, fairly quick, etc, but I won't go into the positives because there are a lot of other reviews on here that do. I've found that the negative reviews are always the most helpful on Amazon, even when an item has thousands of reviews (the negatives always point out stuff that I would also find annoying), so I hope that's also the case with this review.As I write this, I look at my pretty new N97 sitting next to my clunky old E90. The E90 is a beast of a phone, and yet, it did what it was supposed to do, and didn't make you jump through hoops to do it. I'll probably go back to the E90 and its dated apps, even if I have to use the terrible EDGE network for Internet. What I lose in transfer speed will be made up for in typing speed.------------------------------------------------------------------------Update: 11/30/2009I've now used this device for a few months, and have a few more insights and grievances:1. There is very little thought put into the alarm clock function. This is something basic I use all the time--instead of a real alarm clock in fact, so it's important for it to work well. When you set an alarm, the default setting is to create a permanent alarm that would repeat in 24 hours. Most people use alarms for quick reminders, such as when you park at a meter, or to take something out of the oven. So it's super annoying to have to go through and click ""do not repeat"" through a sub menu 5 times per day. Here's what really annoys me: even Nokia doesn't believe it should repeat 24-hours by default, because when you set an alarm for an event in your calendar, the default is to NOT repeat. Why the inconsistency Nokia?2. The slider button to unlock the phone is STILL GARBAGE. I thought it was a good idea, but it works correctly only 2/3rds of the time, even after numerous firmware updates (I always keep up to date). The slider leaves the screen lit every now and then, even when the phone is locked. Sometimes it does nothing (it vibrates but screen stays dark). Sometimes it's laggy so when you unlock it, it does nothing, then you do it again and it quickly unlocks and locks. Stupid. Get it together, Nokia.3. When you're on a phone call and you have to access any applications (such as your contact list to give someone a number), it's hard to get back to your dialer quickly (so you can switch to loudspeaker or switch calls). You have to hold down the button in the lower corner for 2 seconds, then flip through your open applications to your dialer. Stupid. Why does everything take so long to do on this phone?4. Speaking of, the entire phone is TOO SLOW. Basic functions like flipping from portrait to landscape, or pulling up your contact list, or going from locked to unlocked when you answer a phone call are almost always laggy (even with no running applications).5. Browser still has no keyboard shortcuts.6. Copy function is slightly improved (you can drag your finger across text in a text message and a ""Copy"" button will come up), but pasting is still IMPOSSIBLE unless the application specifically allows you to paste. So if you get a text message with an address in it, and you copy the text message into your clipboard buffer, you can't paste it into another application like say, Google Maps. You know, THE ENTIRE POINT OF COPYING AND PASTING ADDRESSES. UGH.7. The proximity detector doesn't work half the time. I'm so tired of the phone going to mute or to some random application because it was held up to my head while the phone's screen was active, so it thinks I'm pressing buttons with my face. Stupid.8. I hate this phone. The only reason I'm still using it is because of a few opensource apps that only exist on it, and it supports the US 3.5G networks, which the old E90 doesn't.I miss my E90.------------------------------------------------------------------------Update: 9/8/2010I absolutely hate this phone. I hate it.I've upgraded the firmware 3-4 times, I lost count. Nothing seems to help. The device lock still doesn't work. Sometimes it locks the screen (if you wait 3 seconds after a call), and sometimes if you don't wait long enough after exiting an app, it locks half the screen (most of it is dark but parts of the UI are still lit). Sometimes it doesn't do anything.I'm rebooting this phone 3-4 times per week due to lock ups. I tried to update Ovi Maps, but it still tries to download to the C: drive despite setting my download drive to E:, and it runs out of disk space. There's nothing more I can remove or delete on C: to run this update. I'm so tired of Nokia. I'm not the only one... the people who used to run Symbian Guru shut down the site recently. This is a big deal. There are no bigger advocates of your product than loyalists who run sites like Symbian Guru. To quote them:""To Nokia, you guys are losing. Hard. Wake the hell up. Doing the same thing repeatedly while expecting different results is the definition of insanity. I've been a huge Nokia fan since my 2nd cellphone, and I just can't do it any longer. You guys aren't competing like you once were, and everyone but you seems to see that. You used to build the world's best smartphones, the world's best cameras, the world's best GPS units - you've lost pretty much all of that, and with nothing to show for it. You unveiled your Ovi vision over 2 years ago - I was there. Today, it's still a complete mess. I have to log in every single time I visit the site - regardless of how many times I check the `remember me' box. I spent 6 months (and about 3 hours at Nokia World 2009) trying to find someone to help me with Ovi Contacts on the web - no one knew who to point me to. You spent millions of dollars purchasing your Ovi pieces - Ovi Files, Ovi Share, and a host of other little companies - are you proud of what you `built' with them? Most of your own employees (that I've talked to) don't even use them, so why should I?""I hate almost everything about this phone. If it didn't support the faster 3G network (faster than other Nokia phones), and migration wasn't such a chore, I'd have ditched it long ago. Alas, there are no great Qwerty phones with all the features I'm looking for, except maybe the new Droid phones coming out. I think that's what I'm going to move on to. Nokia's inability to satisfy their core user base with high quality, high up-time units has lost me as a customer. Nothing short of a full refund and an apology would get me back to Nokia's arms again."

I had the pleasure to play with them. After one week with iPhone 3GS, I am glad to have my N97. There are no so-called perfect phone. but this is what I can do with my N97, very basic, I can change the battery any time I want. I can pop in or take out my SIM card for or from another phone. I can expand my memory capacity by switching my memort card. When 32GB MicroSD is available, my N97 will have 64GB in total (my colleagues were so mad when I slowly put in the battery and 16 GB MicroSD card in front of them). The phone is solid built with great screen display quality. I love the keyboard. iPhone 3GS costs $699 without a contract. I paid less than that for my N97. I have no complain."

The maps feature can work by satellite GPS alone - so if you are really in the boonies -- and I get into those areas -- you can still get a fix on your location, even though you are not near a cell tower. I combined it with a ATT prepaid plan, so I get plenty of voice minutes, unlimited texts, and adequate data for $30 per month. Yes, $30. This is the frugal person's dream. And, it works with maps (for free) in over 70 countries. All for $200.

But you can also run many free Symbian apps and Java apps on it and transfer of data is a breeze (it just looks like a drive to the computer).Some people don't like the resistive touch screen - but I find it just as easy to use as the capacitive on the iPhone.

That left Symbian or first release of Android. N97 ended up in my pocket.First, the good. Except for the minimal memory this hardware is tremendous. Yes, the phone is big and heavy, but it is also nearly bullet-proof, and the keyboard is fine. Really it could replace any netbook/tablet for the uses they have been built for.Now, the bad. I went around and around, finally rating the phone for a 2. It's because of the way Symbian runs, and the small working memory (the only hardware shortcoming). This phone could easily be a 4 star or better except I am so tired of working around the ""memory full"" error, and the lack of apps. And apparently that is because even for my unlocked phone, Nokia has it wrapped up so tight that about half of the apps I want to install need hacks to get it done. And that's the crux of the biscuit, this great hardware is hobbled by the way it's applications are controlled. Mozilla has skipped developing for Symbian 5 and created a Fennec browser for Maemo, but I won't get locked into this lack of apps again. I'll be moving to an Android phone soon.End of MayThe minimal memory has become a very frustrating issue. No matter what I do, once or twice a month I spend an hour messing with that. It is SUCH a shame that this phone isn't great, because it could be so easily. It will be Motorola or HTC Android 2.1 soon."

The N97 was a big disappointment from the very first moment of handling it. The battery cover refused to go on. After thirty minutes of failing and sore fingers, I started reading the manual. For god's sake, I shouldn't need to read the manual to put on a battery cover! The manual was of no help and I began to be violent with it until it was forced on. It has been downhill from there.The N97 is of an exceptional poor design; It looks common from the outside, and is garbage on the inside. Let me review each main function separately:1. Voice: The phone is awkward to hold and speak. The addition of a keyboard really makes it heavy and fat.2. Contacts: This is the WORST aspect of this phone. The phone RANDOMLY chooses when to display an incoming caller Id! All you get is a phone number, and good luck trying to remember which phone number belonged to whom in your contacts. I have had this phone for 5 months now and I still do not know how to fix this major issue. At first, I thought I needed to transfer all the SIM card contacts to the phone's memory contacts, but this did not work.3. Keyboard: The keyboard is not practical. You have to use shift keys for numbers and symbols. A shift key for a period or a colon. A shift key for a smiley face. A terrible Idea.4. Web: The web browser is slower than death, and unresponsive. At one point I almost cracked the screen while surfing from all the frustration. Once you access a web page it is another task to scroll down or sideways.5. GPS: if you are in a pickle or driving and need some quick help finding your way, then don't even consider the N97 as an option. The GPS does not lock onto a signal quickly, it takes the phone a minimum of 15 min to find a signal, and one time it took me 45 min!6. Applications: No good apps. There are applications for facebook, twitter and myspace. However, they are not enjoyable to use. If you have your N97 while among a group of iphone users you will be ashamed to show it off. You look at all those apple users play and laugh about the cool apps they have on their phone, while I am still wondering who is calling me, because this phone can't display the name from the contacts.7. Camera: the photos are OK, not great thought. The flash is a big waste of power, it gives those being pictured a sickly jaundiced look.I urge all who see this to NOT buy this phone, and to tell all their loved ones not to as well. I on the other hand am cursed with this abomination, this travesty of dysform and dysfunction, until I can afford another phone."

That you had to pay $20 to download which was disappointing.The internet connection shifting from webpage to webpage is slow to load, even with a 3.5G network, it was very fast(moreso than my computer) on the N95 phone with a 3G network.Many of the features are hard to figure out without a manual and it is annoying to have the memory card inside the same compartment areas as the battery. Everytime you wish to remove the memory card you have to remove the backplate cover of the phone, instead of having a slot on the side of the phone. There are many icons whle connected to the internet and looking at your email that you have no clue what they mean unless you are used to seeing them. Lot of trial and error.

Though poorly packaged, the item is new [I think...], except for the battery and a tiny piece of rubber that's supposed to be covering a screw for vanity reason. The battery was in the box with the rest of the stuff unprotected/unwrapped with minor stains/dents. The original packaging from sony ericsson is very generic. There is no model number/serial with photos on box as you would expect if purchased from a sony store. The owner's manual is a generic one, not printed for any particular models. Inside, the phone/accessories [ie; battery, charger, lid] were tossed together like a salad, nothing was securely in their proper slot. I am not sure if that's how it came in from the manufacturer [sony ericsson] to the wholesaler, but this purchase could easily be mistaken for being used or refurbished. Fact, I check my purchase details several times upon receiving the package just to make sure I purchased a 'NEW' item vs used or refurbished. Nothing personal, but I'd think twice about this company before purchasing from them again. As for now, I am content with the item 'cause it works. Im keeping my fingers crossed hoping that it will hold up like a sony ericsson and not breakdown on me because it was mishandled by a third party, or it was used/refurbished and listed as new.

"387824","Sony Ericsson Unlocked Vivaz U5 U5i (Blue) Unlocked, International Version with No Warranty",4,"I'm still learning and bonding with my phone since acquiring it in April. This is my first smart phone, but it's a great transition from old school to the new models. I happened upon this phone after months of researching affordable phones and features, I was ready to give up and settle for something less. And then I saw this blue Sony Ericsson Vivaz U5. I was drawn to the 3G phone with the 8 mp camera and recording features that are easy to operate. However, I'm disappointed in my night and long-distance photo quality. It takes great action shots of kids on trampolines! I love the 3 options for texting, plus the slimness, lightness, and is easy to hold. The screen size is just right, and the scrolling is easy. As for battery, I only recharge a couple times a week--depending on camera use. It recharges pretty quick within an hour or two. One annoyance is whenever the phone is not used for a couple of minutes, it reverts to locked mode, (kind of kid-proofed), but all I have to do is press the green ""on"" button once and hit the ""Unlock"" and I can place calls. I still haven't figured out how to transfer my pictures from the phone to my computer or on-line, even using the USB cord attached to the charger cord that came with the phone. The phone was set up for AT&T which means it was new, but still locked. Issue was resolved after a week's worth of e-mails.

There are many disappointments for me though. #1 There is a space on the top of the phone where you put in the SD card...it already is worn out and pops up at anytime. This makes your podcast or music stop, once you clamp the top back on, it restarts whatever you were playing. #2 Texting. I'm not a huge texter, but this phone isn't the easiest. I had a Samsung rugby that seemed way easier. also...I've already had multiple times when my texts don't even get to the person I'm trying to contact. #3 The charge cord must go in the same place as the headphones.....so no charging your phone while using your headphones. #4 The headphones jack isn't the standard. You have to buy an adaptor which for me isn't ideal. It's almost a complete deal breaker. #5 While driving, I like to use the speaker phone, this is difficult because it is muffled. I can't understand the ppl I'm talking to. Now when listening to podcast the quality of the speakers seem fine. I spent tons of time researching trying to get the perfect phone...disappointed."

It won't connect to my computer via USB. I researched to see what the problem could be and I found out that I don't have the proper software to connect my phone. Well, the manual gives you the website where you can download this software except that the website is no longer functional, and the website that it redirects you to does not have this model on it.3. My 1GB Micro SD card doesn't work in the phone either. It clicks in place but the phone doesn't read the card. It's like it doesn't exist. Basically I can't put anything on the phone or take anything off.4.

"387875","Sony Ericsson W580i Unlocked Quadband Phone (Black)",4,"The phone is a great size. They matte black and orange is attractive. The slide works. The center button/circle takes a little more force than I'd like to push down, you have to really press on it. The screen is bright and the voice quality great. The music for the walkman part is great as well. I like the exercise tracking things that are included. Over all a nice phone. Cons: The screen really needs extra protection, I could see how it might break without something covering it over time; the battery. This phone drains almost half way down in one day of NON talk time. Seriously. If you make what seems like a few fairly short calls, by the end of the day the battery is about 3/4 gone. I can't imagine getting into an emergency situation where I'd need to talk for a long time, or be away from a power source as I'd be totally out of luck. As you can't turn the screen down to less than 50% brightness (plenty bright) and there are extra lights that you can't turn off, I can't even imagine having bluetooth or the internet turned on continuously as you'd end up with a dead phone probably 1/2 way through the day.

I have always enjoyed the walkman phones as a great sport phone even if i don't always use it as a primary phone. I can move my SIM and use it for biking, skiing, etc. My wife also enjoys the walkman phones as well. I really wanted to upgrade here to the W995a for Christmas. We had one but over use and wear and tear it needs to be replaced. I really want to get a W995a and was excited to see it here on Amazon. I see that this same seller orderinstantcom has both listing right now on Amazon. They show 2 separate listing, W995A and W995. I have attempted to order from them twice, to order the W995a. And they seem to have a good price and are prompt , ship right away , and the product shows up right away. Unfortunately they have shipped me TWO W995 international version twice in a row. I am not sure how to tell them to make sure they send me a W995a.They A version DOES do 3G on AT&T and that is what i am looking for. I have emailed the seller and also put a note in my last order when placing the order to ask if they could verify the W995a before shipping it to me. No luck. I did get prompt RMA service and FedEx the phone right back to them and am awaiting the credit back now. The 2nd order arrived today and was still wrong , so i am awaiting a 2nd RMA to get that one sent back. I am hoping to contact them directly and get a response because i really want to get the right product and am willing to try again and order the W995a if i can get the ""A"" Version.The plain W995 ( no a ) is still a great phone and will work on the GSM bands in the U.S. and overseas but will be slower on data and not support 3G in the U.S. the bands and electronics (internally to the phone) are different between the W995 and W995a and there is no Flash or Upgrade or Crack or anything you can do to make the non A version become the A version.Connectivity Data i got from Sony.Wireless Radio GSM 850/900/1800/1900 MHz UMTS 850/1800/1900 MHzCompatible Carrier & Service AT&T, AT&T 3G, T-Mobile, Rogers, Fido3G 3G / UMTSWi-Fi Support IEEE802.11b/gData transfer GPRS, EDGE, HSDPA, WiFi"

Speaking of which, all the ""cell phone"" icons on my new w995 are pictures of my old cell phone, the k790. Hella random! but yeah, it's been really good so far, except for the fact that Amazon Seller J&R Music/Computer sent me a German phone, with the instruction booklet in Deutsche, and some strange Euro-charger with a bulky US adapter.I'm a bit disappointed that the geo-tagging photos doesn't seem to be recognized on my computer, but it locates the photos OK on the phone. Lotsa pre-loaded and downloadable free games from Sony are nice! Conversation-style texts are a nice new feature. Battery life is awesome; usually 3-4 days between charges. Best new feature? The LED flashlight! Speaking of which, photos in low-lighting are extremely disappointing and grainy, not sharp at all. The kickstand is A-OK, despite all the other reviewers' claims. The side-button placement is a little annoying or awkward, with the volume/zoom buttons (which are very small) placed right next to the shutter button, and all the music-playback buttons right next to those - while the opposite side of the phone only has 1 button!"

"387935","Sony Ericsson W995a Walkman Unlocked Phone with 3G, 8.1 MP, WiFi, Stereo Bluetooth, and Assisted GPS--U.S. Version with Warranty (Progressive Black)",2,"I have been a Sony Ericsson cell phones fan since 2004. Last year (December 2009) after much thought I decided to buy this model being this the top of the line of the ""old school"" SE phones and by ""old school"" I am talking about the W,K,C and such series and not the newest models like the AINO or SATIO. Anyway I ended up giving this phone to my sister and I bought instead a iPhone 3GS much to my dismay. Why? Because the [...] application in the W995a just can't compare to the iPhone application. Even tough the W995a screen is way smaller than the iPhone one the video resolution is terrible, really terrible and almost unsee-able. When I made a comparison with the youtube iPhone application the difference was abysmal. The other big problem is with the camera. I mean, this is a phone not a professional camera but come on, it says 8.1 mega and the photos are worse than your regular 2 mega camera. Even the iPhone with just 3.2 mega takes better pictures. I think is the lens quality (very bad) that makes the W995a such a lousy ""camera phone"". Don't get me wrong: this is Sony Ericsson at it's best and as always the conversation audio quality is great, reception is great but when you come to other features like web browsing and reading emails this phone really fails in comparison with any smartphone, from HCT to Nokia to Apple. Even tough the screen is bigger than other phones the text is also big so you don't really use the bigger screen and the small font is unreadable. In conclusion: This is one of the best phones available but as that is VERY EXPENSIVE because in other features like web browsing, reading emails (it can't read any office or pdf attachment) and almost other applications it fails in comparison with other phones, specially with a iPhone. It really is a shame because this is the end of a love relationship with Sony Ericsson I have had since 2004 and I never thought I was going to get a iPhone but this phone didn't meet my expectations at all. As the title says, the phone really disappointed me. One last issue: the keypad is awfully small and very very hard to use. Other SE phones down on the range offers better keypads. The walkman function of the W995a is great I have to say and the 8g memory stick is great. I know this review seems like a contradiction but it is because its hard to say only bad thing about a phone made by a brand you have been in love with for so many years."
"387936","Sony Ericsson W995a Walkman Unlocked Phone with 3G, 8.1 MP, WiFi, Stereo Bluetooth, and Assisted GPS--U.S. Version with Warranty (Progressive Black)",4,"Not a smartphone, yet pretty smartAfter my Nokia E51 came to an end, I started looking for a replacement that would best suite my needs. Taught by previous experiences, my aim was a larger screen unlocked phone equipped with GPS device, intuitive user interface, decent sync, email and tethering capabilities, W-LAN and a modern media player.After days of research, my choice came down to two models: Nokia N86 and Sony Ericsson W995a. Both feature excellent characteristics, and seem to perfectly meet my needs. At the end, the design weighted in favor of the SE.The phone comes in three flavors: Red, Progressive Black and Brushed Metal. I bought mine from Amazon, and they only had the Progressive Black Model. Note that my model's name is W995a, which means that it supports frequencies across Americas, but rest reassured, it works in Europe and Asia as well on all networks, GSM and 3G.When you take it out of the box, it smells good, feels new and geeky :) Once you get to play with it, it feels solid in hand, and the sliding mechanism is excellent. The phone comes with an USB cable, wall charger, headphones, battery, printed and electronic documentation, and a generous 8GB memory card. Note that some operators in certain countries give you a set of plug-in stereo speakers, but those don't come standard.It's a slide form factor quad-band phone with 2.6"" display, 8.1 MP camera, kickstand, secondary video call camera, Sony Walkman with dedicated buttons, 3.5mm audio jack (thank you, Sony Ericsson, it was about the time) W-LAN, and loads of other features.At first, I found its buttons rather uncomfortable, for they are fairly flat and wide, and you need to operate them with you fingernails. The upper command buttons feel odd too, especially answer and hangup ones, for they are located at the very edge of the device. But it did not take me long to accommodate.The display is fairly large, showing crisp and clear images, and allowing various sizes of text to be displayed correctly. Its resolution of 320x240 pixels isn't exactly the top of the class, neither is the color range of mere 256k. However, I ran a test with a .jpg image taken with my Nikon camera on Sony Ericsson W995 and Nokia E51, featuring 16M colors. Surprisingly enough, comparing side-by-side the two models, the W995 display proved to have more vibrant colors, and the overall impression of the image was by far better Nokia's one.The phone comes with its own default animated and beautiful theme that goes great with its design. If you prefer the classic Sony Ericsson looks, you can switch back at any time, though the selection of themes that comes pre-installed is poor.Experience of browsing through menus, writing messages and making calls is ok, even though the interface sometimes lacks responsiveness due to animated themes and quantity of contents.Furthermore, W995 comes with tons of apps and features you easily get used to and never want to leave behind. For example, pedometer, accelerometer, shake control, location service, and many great solutions that exploit this hardware make this device a very versatile must-have multi purpose pocket device you always want to carry around. Less known goodies of this products are the camera flash that can be used either as torch or as SOS signaling device, and the USB battery charging capability. The last one is particularly useful when you say tether it with a computer to go online. This normally drains your battery very quickly, but in the case of W-series, your battery is being recharged instead of consumed. And when you press the +/- volume button in standby mode, it displays a clock with some basic information across the entire screen. Additionally, the phone comes filled with cool games that are great for killing time on airports :) and a coupon for a free download of 100 Sony production songs.What I particularly liked about this phone is the ease of tethering with any major OS platforms out there. I've tested it on a Mac (Snow Leopard 10.6) and Windows XP Professional, and it worked like a charm. With W995, using your phone as a GSM or 3G modem is no longer a nightmare. The functionality is built right in, and when you connect it to any computer via an USB cable, you get prompted to choose amongst the fallowing: use your phone as modem, mass storage, file transfer, sync or PC suite.Viewing / listening to media content is an amazing experience. The interface is easy and intuitive thanks to dedicated buttons, and the sound quality is unprecedented. However, getting your contents to your phone is another pair of shoes.While the PC suite is an excellent peace of work, the software for Mac looks and feels poor. It all seems like sugar and cream for you PC guys out there, but what about us, the Mac users? Well, it's not that we're not taken into consideration, far from that. However, serious improvements are yet to be made issuing Mac-Sony Ericsson friendship. What you get on the Sony Ericsson web site is an iSync plugin (available only recently), allowing you to sync your contacts, tasks, and calendars between W995 and your Mac. And MediaSync, which is, or should be, the equivalent of MediaGo. The truth is, it allows you to transfer music and podcasts, but not the videos. Kind of sad. The good side is that it works well with iTunes library, and manages your music and podcasts flawlessly. Yet transferring videos between a Mac and your W995 still remains an issue. There are ways around, but they don't always work.On the iSync level, things are not shining either. With the older version of iSync plugin, the synchronizing process was fairly time consuming since it was not incremental. That means that every time you want to synchronize your contacts, tasks and calendars, it completely replaces the entire content. This was soon fixed by an updated plugin, so now it takes far less time. Furthermore, it crippled my address book since the two databases are still far from compatible.However, this all shows that Sony Ericsson is still pioneering in the Mac compatibility field, and hopefully these issues will be addressed in the upcoming versions of firmware. What I do like about the Sony Ericsson bluetooth syncing is that you can enable it to always accept demands from known devices. That way you no longer have to frenetically look for your device (pocket? desk? handbag? quick!), each time iSync starts. Just make sure it's within the bluetooth range, and you're in sync, with no annoying dialogues around.Another annoying thing about this product is the lack of support for certain character formats. So when you receive an email written in say croatian keyboard layout, instead of the actual content, it displays a ""unknown character set"" message. So it's clear to see that W995 is still pretty much an unfinished product, from the firmware developing standpoint.And now to camera! I had no special demands on my phone's camera, so I completely forgot about it. But when I got to play with it, I found that it's not bad at all. In fact, it's a 8,1MP camera with autofocus, flash, face and smile recognition, and loads of other features from the k-series! And the picture quality is awesome! Holy cow! The down side is that the picture quality suffers dramatically in low light conditions: the colors fade or go crazy, contours mix up, and a huge amount of noise takes away all the pleasure. So you can either try to save it in an image editing software or just be honest and conclude that the pic sucks. Up to you :)So the bottom line is: shot on sun, and keep the good impression. Another interesting thing about the camera is a dedicated shutter button. Very nice feature. However, it can also be a problem at times. You see, when you want to take a picture, first you need to press the shutter button halfway down, to allow the autofocus to find objects you presumably want to sharpen up. The process takes up to 5 seconds, after which you get this annoying beep, meaning: Now you can press the button all the way down. Yeah, right. Your object is by than far away from the frame, the kids are no longer smiling, and the dog just knocked off chasing his tale. This can be particularly annoying when asking someone to take a picture of you.Last but not the least: the build quality. Though the phone is solid and feels expensive, my recommendation is to pay attention to scratches and bruises. The chassis is extremely sensitive to scratches, and I recommend buying a screen cover and a some kind of protective case right away. The Sony Ericsson logo is subject to damage as well as the ""W995"" sign, since both are no other but stickers and tend to peel off with the time.All in all, an excellent phone, but the competition in its price range is stiff. Some software issues remain loose ends, but they'll probably get ironed up.the GOOD:-features (big)-camera (despite all the odds)-3.5 audio jack-unprecedented media experience-usb charged battery-intuitive interface-DLNA (haven't tested it though)-sliding mechanism-attention to detailsthe BAD-poor Mac compatibility-poor build quality of the chassis-lack of character support for many languages in default email app-kickstand feels clumsy-WLAN doesn't work in some hotspots-lack of search storage capability-browsing through address book feels like the year 2000-other small imperfections in firmware"

"387940","Sony Ericsson W995a Walkman Unlocked Phone with 3G, 8.1 MP, WiFi, Stereo Bluetooth, and Assisted GPS--U.S. Version with Warranty (Progressive Black)",4,"I am using this phone for over a month now and am very very pleased with it. It would have got 5-Star rating if not for the 3 design flaws with the phone.1. Kick Stand design can't be any worse. It is not firmly stuck in closed position. If Sony Ericsson couldn't get it right they should have skipped this hardware. It would have saved them money and made the phone feel more solid.2. Battery cover - like others said in the review doesn't feel firm. You can feel slight movement when you press fingers around the Sony Ericsson name on the back. It feels little annoying to see a well built phone choke on battery cover design. I first thought I got a bad phone and thought of exchanging it but after reading reviews here and other forums it looks like a pretty common not with just this phone but several SE phones. I put a paper folded above the battery and it solved this problem.3. The Call Button and End Call buttons are not positioned ergonomically. They are located little too far from the D-pad and it hurts the fingers to reach them from center.Good things about the phone:1. Looks way better than in pictures and is getting lot of compliments from everyone who sees the phone.2. Feels solid and super sexy. Easily the best slider phone I've seen.3. Bright screen and very readable even in bright sunlight.4. Came with lot of games, applications, and 8GB Memory Stick Micro.5. GPS reception, AT&T 3G connection, WiFi connection - all are very good.6. First time I saw a 3.5mm audio output which is a great plus for me as I have several good headphones I can use.7. To compliment the 3.5mm audio output, this phone easily replaces my Zune 8GB during my workout sessions. Sounds just as good.8. The flash themes are very very good looking.9. Battery felt average the first few weeks but seem to have improved greatly after few weeks. I am heavy user of browser, office outlook emails, calendar, and songs listener and the phone easily lasts the entire day even after I talk on average over 60+ minutes.10. Works with my office Exchange Server to sync Outlook Email and Calendar as well as my Google mail.Amazon has the best price for this phone.TIP for W995a owners: Install Opera Mini 5 beta. The browsing experience is excellent with small fonts."

This works especially well for web and gps.Much improved over previous SonyEricsson sliders I've seen or used.The only drawback is the poor battery life - esecially when using wifi, bluetooth, and internet capabilities. When using these options, I usually have to charge each night. I guess I guess I was spoiled when I was using a phone without these options since I only needed to recharge my phone every 3 or 4 days."
"387942","Sony Ericsson W995a Walkman Unlocked Phone with 3G, 8.1 MP, WiFi, Stereo Bluetooth, and Assisted GPS--U.S. Version with Warranty (Progressive Black)",4,"I love the phone the camera features are wayyyy better than my actual camera the sound quality even better than before. I love this phone more than an iphone that every other person in the world has. HAPPY that it came with the 8GB M2 card cause my previous Sony Ericsson I had to buy. This is just the greatest phone I have ever bought!!!"
"387943","Sony Ericsson W995a Walkman Unlocked Phone with 3G, 8.1 MP, WiFi, Stereo Bluetooth, and Assisted GPS--U.S. Version with Warranty (Progressive Black)",3,"I purchased this phone from Amazon a week ago, after researching for over a month looking to replace my classic iPhone 16GB. I was looking for an unlocked multimedia phone and was leaning towards the Nokia N85. I have to say that while most reviews out there favor the Nokia, I cave into the looks of the W995a. Someone at Cnet said it is not the sexiest phone around, but I beg to differ, the phone is very sleek, the slider mechanism is flawless and the overall presentation of the hardware is much higher end that any of the new (available) Nokias I've seen. It is slimmer that the N85, and the brushed metal case is very elegant and looks way better than the plastic on the mentioned Nokia handset.It should be noted, as mentioned by other reviewers, that this is not a smartphone, meaning that there is limited customization and most of the applications you get are web based, a la iPhone two years ago. Since this phone is unlocked (something I really desired, and the main reason I did not upgrade my iPhone) you have to play around with the settings a little bit to get the most out of the features of this phone. For instance, I had a hard time figuring out how to get it to stream videos over the YouTube application that comes as part of the media interface. I have MediaNet (EDGE) service from AT&T and was not able to stream any video. Then I discovered that if you turn off the WiFi you will get it, though a bit chopped since EDGE is not the best for video streaming. That being said, I still have to figure out how to get it to stream over WiFi, which should be much better. Oddly, most reviewers elsewhere had the opposite problem: they were able to stream over WiFi but could not get it to stream over EDGE. The workaround for the WiFi problem seems to be opening extra ports on your wireless router, something I am completely illiterate on. So this is a major drawback of the phone: for a phone that is claimed to be the flagship multimedia device from SE, all these bugs and problems should not be present, especially at this price range. Not being able to access YouTube properly is just unacceptable. Paying customers should not have to waste time trying to figure out things engineers and technicians at SE get paid to do. If you go to the SE webpage and look for support for this device you will be able to get the settings sent to your phone for proper web navigation, email and picture messaging... but nothing for the video streaming problem.This phone comes with an 8.1 MP camera with single LED flash. The pictures outdoors with good natural light are OK, but things get much worse indoors or with limited light. If you already have a nice point and shoot, this phone won't replace it. If you are looking for a new phone and to upgrade an old point and shoot, then maybe this phone will save you some bucks. Don't get me wrong, the camera is very good, it's just that reading 8.1 MP on the specs creates very high expectations.The real treat of this phone comes from the music player. The sound is just amazing. I did not know how much sound quality I was sacrificing with my iPhone and iPods until I listened to the music player in this phone: I was blown away. It should also be mentioned that the phone comes equipped with FM radio, which is actually very nice. The bundled Media Go software serves as an iTunes-like application to manage all your media files on your phone. It has a drag and drop interface that makes easy to add any songs, videos or photos to your phone, and guess what? Also from your phone to your computer (take that iPhone!). As any new piece of software, Media Go is not without flaws. When transferring songs from my library into my phone I received many error messages about unsuccessful transfers. I was able to go back and fix some of those but sometimes there were so many that it was hard to keep track (the program puts a check next to all successful transfers but puts no visual indication whatsoever next to the unsuccessful ones). It also failed to display some of my iTunes artwork. However, if you already use iTunes as your music player and media organizing program, MediaGo will easily import everything from your iTunes folder. Another important caveat is that updating your phone's firmware erases the phone's internal memory (not the memory card or the SIM card), so it is important to back up your phone using the SE PC Suite before every update.Call quality is just OK. It can get pretty bad in noisy environments, e.g. supermarket. Google maps works great. So, to sum up, if you are looking for a great-looking phone with a superb music player, OK video player, and OK camera and do not want to sign up for a 2-year bleed-out contract, you should definitely consider the W995a.UPDATE (After 3 months with the phone): So even though the media Go experience hasn't been the best, I was happy overall with the phone. That is until today when I updated the firmware. I backed up the phone as recommended, and followed all the instructions. Then, after the update I restored my phone using my backup. The contacts failed to restore and now I have lost all my contacts, but what is worse, all the customizations I had for some of them, i.e., ringtones and photos. Not only that, but about half the music and all the videos I had in the memory card got erased, which was not supposed to happen, since only the phone memory is supposed to be cleaned during the firmware update. All these things are just unacceptable for a cell phone this expensive. I never had such problems with my old iPhone. I will try to get rid of this phone as soon as possible and go back to Apple's boring but reliable products."

It has a great camera and does good video. Some of the controls are a small (volume rocker)"
"387945","Sony Ericsson W995a Walkman Unlocked Phone with 3G, 8.1 MP, WiFi, Stereo Bluetooth, and Assisted GPS--U.S. Version with Warranty (Progressive Black)",3,"This phone is unbranded (meaning you cannot get it from your local at&t or T-Mobile store here in the U.S.) So since the phone is unbranded forget about customer service help from your wireless carrier. All they tell you is contact Sony Ericsson. When you call Sony Ericsson customer service, they're very arrogant, and all they try to do is to let you use their support page on their website.The phone is good looking and solid, however many reviewers in other places [...] have returned their phone due to faulty battery cover that wobbles, and the kickstand is loose and doesn't stay in place. Unfortunately these problem occurs when your 30 days are up and you cannot return your product for a full refund!SE claims a 8.1 megapixel camera, but that is far from taking great pictures, at best their okay!The case IC-45 that SE offers for the phone is generic (meaning not specially made for this model) and when you put the phone in there the latch doesn't close and you have to force it. Forcing it touches the off button and your phone is off without you knowing it. The belt case is made of plastic that is very hard to use and that it can break easily!The GPS program that come pre-installed is Wayfinder, and it's a European company not even comparable to Tomtom, Garmin. Telenav doesn't offer a program for this specific model and their CS is another story.So basically you're paying for a great looking phone without any support from your carrier and SE.The music player (Walkman) is great and sounds great! Youtube application doesn't work, you have to mess with the firmware and it's not recommended for none tech savvy people! (this is where you find that at&t doesn't care since it's not their branded phone and SE doesn't care since they really don't care after they sell you the device, and they tell you you should contact your carrier!).So, bottom line if you're tech savvy, you have $450+ to burn, and you change phone often then yes buy this phone by all mean. However if you want tech support, cheaper phone, buy a branded version from your own wireless carrier.[...]"
"387946","Sony Ericsson W995a Walkman Unlocked Phone with 3G, 8.1 MP, WiFi, Stereo Bluetooth, and Assisted GPS--U.S. Version with Warranty (Progressive Black)",4,"I decided to purchase the w995a after carefully researching some viable alternatives such as the Nokia n86 8mp, the still-good and underrated n96, and the n82. I chose the Sony because it looks and feels better than the other phones, not because it IS better than the others. Let me explain.This phone is absolutely gorgeous. Its made of brushed metal, it feels amazing in your hand, and the sliding mechanism is nearly perfect. It's a feature phone, so you really don't have any options to customize the UI like you would with a symbian phone (i.e. the nokias mentioned above), but if this doesn't bother you (which it did not bother me), it really won't matter because the menu layout is really perfect and intuitive. It has great sound, it's beautiful when lit up, and the call quality is superb. That being said, it's simply not a ""better"" phone than the nokias I've listed.For one, the camera is simply ""ok."" Shots taken indoors will disappoint you, while those taken outdoors look very good. The video recording is old-school at 30fps QVGA while the nokias mentioned record DVD quality video at 30fps in VGA. Not to mention the nokias have carl ziess optics (regarded as one of the best lense makers in the world).I decided not to go with the Nokia N86, it's ""closest"" competitor. The N86 is a better phone, it has an 8gb hard drive while the w995a comes with an 8gb card. The nokia can be expanded with up to a 16gb card, has a variable aperture 8mp that takes exquisite photos, and has the ever- customizable symbian UI. But its ugly, and plastic; typical Nokia.So, to sum it up:THE GOOD:-beautiful-well built-beautiful interface-good pictures-excellent media player-best sliding mech. everTHE BAD:-other phones in its price range are arguable better-should take great pictures, not good ones-video recording is 2004-era phone-has a TFT 256k screen, while all others in its price range have AMOLED 16M screens.It was a tough choice, but for me, the look and feel of this one took the cake!"

"387996","Sony Ericsson X10 Mini E10i Black Unlocked Android Phone (Internation Version No US Warrenty)",3,"This phone is good overall. It lets you do every thing I would expect from a smartphone at a low price. However, you should remember this is an old phone and it's not even supported anymore by Sony Ericsson. It comes with the latest Android version supported for this: 2.1. What bothers me the most about that is that you need Android 2.3 or more to be able to install apps in the microSD card, and the internal storage is very limited in this phone. In the specs I've seen it says it supports 16 GB microSD cards, but I'm using it with a 32 GB class 10 card without a problem.Physically the phone is compact and sturdy. A friend of my even was thrown into a pool with this phone in his pocket and as soon as the phone dried it started working again. Another friend didn't have such luck with his Samsung SII. Two thing I don't like about the design is that you cannot remove the battery and the cap for the USB cable, which gets impossible to remove."

Also i will recomend to avoid open wi-fi sources that you don't trust and sites that they can put cokies and malwares into your phone and install a good antivirus for full protection I am giving 3 stars because the issue that i have now is that after i am using my mobile data it is becoming slow and i have to restart it, and the battery it lasts less than a day, but after all i am happy that i am having my phone back."
"388041","Sony Ericsson Xperia Mini ST15i Unlocked GSM Android Smartphone--International Version with No US Warranty (Black)",1,"Don't buy this phone.I bought this phone to this seller two months ago, now this phone have problems with the touch screen and always is vibrating, can not use the menus because always come back to the home screen. there is a video where you can see this problem and other users with the same problem: [...]I don't know if can apply the guarantee with this seller."
"388042","Sony Ericsson Xperia Mini ST15i Unlocked GSM Android Smartphone--International Version with No US Warranty (Black)",1,"I didn't do much research before buying this phone and now I'm paying for it. After buying this phone, I found out that the phone has a manufacturing defect that can't be fixed. The phone gets hot after minor use, which automatically activates its capacitive touch buttons. This in turn leads to the ""menu and screen dance,"" where different menus and screens keep popping up automatically. Check out the attached video to see this problem in action. You can find thousands of people on internet who are facing the same issue. The phone is useless and the seller has washed his hands off by not providing any US warranty. If I talk to Sony customer service, they tell me that this is not a US phone and so they can't do anything about it. Why is the seller selling a defective product in the first place? Donate your money or do something better with it rather than wasting it this way."
"388052","Sony Ericsson Xperia PLAY Android Phone (Verizon Wireless)",5,"I bought this phone for the game element only. After receiving it I got it set up in under an hour using wi-fi only. Also the camera and video is a plus. Something my psp could never do. You can also browse the internet faster and use android apps. The phone also came with it's own screen protector. Thank you soo much."
"388053","Sony Ericsson Xperia PLAY Android Phone (Verizon Wireless)",4,"I got one of these just for $#!*$ & giggles, not too shabby!Sony xperia build quality impresses. The phone is not as largeas it looks on one of the original ads (girl must have had atiny hand lol ) the slide mechanism is a little slippery butsolid.As a game device, it's a bit underpowered, but this doesn'tseem to slow it down! Played all games i tried perfectly!Have yet to try it as a phone, wifi only so far.Gingerbread kinda stale by now but, NO ICS for the play.Sony cites instability issues that would compromise thePlay's core strength, GAMING.Custom roms around thought (rooted only, I did root only)The ergonomics of the phone are pretty good too.The slideout PS controller works great, even the ""Digilogs""?and the device as a whole doesn't feel to clunky in the hand.Only cons are the slippery slideout hinge and the overallGlossiness, which makes it a fingerprint magnet for usgreasballs...lol also wish the white was available toUSA carriers.Edit: UPDATEHaving had the phone for a bit longer I can say that in the openposition the phone is somewhat uncomfortable to hold for longperiods. I have average hands (large) slender and the slide outcontroller feels...to thin, and a bit smallish, leading to handfatigue fairly quick. The L & R shoulder buttons are difficult tomaintain your fingers at, while the touchpads feel to closetogether.Also the power/standby button is pathetically small, a smallsliver really. Sure you can use the menu buttons to wake thephone but eventually you need to use the power/standby buttonand it's tiny...But the phone really is a fun devise even just for gaming.Plus not being massive makes it a decent handset as well."
"388054","Sony Ericsson Xperia PLAY Android Phone (Verizon Wireless)",5,"Arrived way before expected date of arrival so that was definitely a plus. Phone was in perfect condition and no item was missing from the box. At a way cheaper price than the retail value at either Verizon's store or website can't really go wrong. Had it for more than a month now and am writing this from it so the phone will work. This version is specifically for Verizon in the u.s., so be careful about which version you buy."
"388055","Sony Ericsson Xperia PLAY Android Phone (Verizon Wireless)",3,"Buen dia el articulo no me sirvio por que e telefono es CDMA y ya no lo homologan en venezuela, no me di cuenta. De todos formas muchas gracias."
"388056","Sony Ericsson Xperia PLAY Android Phone (Verizon Wireless)",5,"My only advice when looking for apps is to use a google search and use the term ""apk""makes tracking down the Emulators much easierLove this phone on my second one after an encounter ocean water fried the first one"
"388057","Sony Ericsson Xperia PLAY Android Phone (Verizon Wireless)",4,"I really liked it but I wish it was a 4G phone. If you like gameing this might be the phone for you, that is if you don't mind 3G only."
"388058","Sony Ericsson Xperia PLAY Android Phone (Verizon Wireless)",1,"he product arrived in perfect condition, but to my frustration came with the CDMA technology that is not used in Brazil, this only works with GSM cellular technology. The mobile this useless, to make matters worse I was taxed in Brazil on 60% of what made the expensive product. The suggestion I make is for the amazon review is a way for your clients are not taxed, sending its products with a lower value in their notes."
"388059","Sony Ericsson Xperia PLAY Android Phone (Verizon Wireless)",4,"It is a good phone. This the second we have purchased. It lacks adequate space to load some of the better games.Overall a fun phone for my teenage son."

"388062","Sony Ericsson Xperia PLAY Android Phone (Verizon Wireless)",4,"this is a pretty awesome phone but it does take a bit of tinkering to really get it to where you like. The r800x now has official Sony support for unlocking bootloader for android development"
"388063","Sony Ericsson Xperia PLAY Android Phone (Verizon Wireless)",1,"Packaging was not what it described. Phone was not new and charger did not belong to device. The usb charge cable did not belong to the device wall charger.That should say it all. Highly would never recommend at all. And Amazon if these are the types of sellers you support I will stop shopping at Amazon."
"388064","Sony Ericsson Xperia PLAY Android Phone (Verizon Wireless)",1,"After two days the screen was messing up and things went bad from there by a week the screen didnt work and the phone wouldn't turn on"
"388065","Sony Ericsson Xperia PLAY Android Phone (Verizon Wireless)",5,"I love it l!! Runs games really well !!! I would recommend buying ! Best cross over gaming phone in existence"
"388066","Sony Ericsson Xperia PLAY Android Phone (Verizon Wireless)",2,"We got this phone to replace the original Xperia Play we had and dropped, thus cracking the screen. This phone shuts off whenever it wants to, alarm only works when it decides it wants, and it sometimes goes black and vibrates on it's own. I cannot recommend this phone as a phone, only as a portable game system with very limited games."
"388067","Sony Ericsson Xperia PLAY Android Phone (Verizon Wireless)",5,"Very awesome phone came fast love the controller set up"
"388068","Sony Ericsson Xperia PLAY Android Phone (Verizon Wireless)",5,"BEST PHONE EVER!!!!!!"

"388070","Sony Ericsson Xperia PLAY Android Phone (Verizon Wireless)",5,"awsome for games, but garbage as a phone. what kind of monster would sign off on a 400 megabyte internal hard drive. someone needs to be fired for that at sony. even when you root the phone and install everything on the sd card you fill up in about 10 games.The actual seller gets five stars not the phone. the phone gets 3 stars"
"388071","Sony Ericsson Xperia PLAY Android Phone (Verizon Wireless)",1,"The phone itself is awesome but the condition if the one I revived horrable I survived 4 tours in iraq and the phone seems like it did also only speaker phone works for conversation it shuts off randomly all the time and the key pad forget it your not sending any texts of this pos but its an awesome idea Sony had just wish I would have waited to get a wirking one"
"388072","Sony Ericsson Xperia PLAY Android Phone (Verizon Wireless)",3,"Item was described as new, instead some of the buttons were worn and the entire back cover was missing. It took several attempts to finally receive the back cover and almost a month to finally get the cover. If I had wanted reconditioned or used item I would have purchased for that price and condition."
"388073","Sony Ericsson Xperia PLAY Android Phone (Verizon Wireless)",1,"PoS. Vcast doesn't exist anymore. Cannot download additional games no matter what size SD card you buy unless you root/hack your phone ultimately risking bricking phone. All DL automatically go to phone which comes with no space, preloaded crap cannot be moved to SD & no games will fit long enough to manually move to SD & no option available to auto download to SD on this device. Waste of $$$."
"388074","Sony Ericsson Xperia PLAY Android Phone (Verizon Wireless)",5,"My favorite phone! Screw the iphone 6 I hate Apple! The New Z3 didn't have the slideout controll pad I was looking for originally I was dreaming that one day Nintendo would come out with a smartphone/game console of their own but that has yet to happen. So I'm satisfied with this for now. This phone is really going to train me on how to manage memory, cuz Sony wasn't smart enough to make their first gaming phone have more then just 255 megabites of memory u need to 32 freakin' gigs man! SERIOUSLY! But if I can puck wisely that one game that will be a fun ride as long as this phone lasts, I shouldn't need anything else. I gotta keep it to a minimum. I payed my own phone activation and this phone made me abandon MetroPCS!"

You can most likely find this phone used for 40-50 bucks where a psvita or 3ds will run you 125-150 used and have a much faster wi-fi and internet process speed, larger and clearer display.

When I opened the box the phone was in a Sony Ericson box for a flip phone .. I love this phone and expected a NEW (not used or refurbished one) phone ...Now to the problem:#1 I love the phone but the problem is when I use it everything works except when on the internet .. It will connect and stay online for 10 seconds to a minute (longer it you don't try to navigate past the Home screen of the page your looking at) then the phone powers down and back up without warning ...#2 The screen blacks out if the outside temp. is over 75 degrees and without warning and to reset that you have to remove the battery for a secondOverall the phone was CRAP unless that's all you wanted it for was to place a call (like a home phone or cell from the 80's) SO I can not stress the FACT anymore .. Buy it from someone not selling you JUNK like these guys"

"388163","Sony Ericsson Xperia PLAY Android Phone (Verizon Wireless)",5,"I can't comment on this as a phone, as I don't have Verizon service. I bought it solely as a portable gaming device, for emulators specifically. Google the Nesoid family of emulators (Gameboid, N64oid etc.) or go to XDA Forum's Xperia Play page, and you will not be disappointed with the potential this has a retro gaming device."
"388164","Sony Ericsson Xperia PLAY Android Phone (Verizon Wireless)",5,"I purchased this phone for my teenage son who selected this phone due to the gaming keypad. He loves the phone! Only issue is that the case he bought doesn't allow for use of one of the side buttons so he is not using a protective case. The phone was a good value on Amazon and I'd recommend the phone and this seller."

"388169","Sony Ericsson Xperia PLAY Android Phone (Verizon Wireless)",3,"For the first week i loved the phone. had no issues or anything other than it being stuck in roaming mode. i got the phone to play games and see how everything was over wifi before getting the phone turned on. but after having the phone for about 2 weeks, i have had it randomly crash on some of the apps that came on the phone. or completely stop responding. and just a few hours ago i unplugged it from charging and every 10 seconds (while the screen was off) the phone would light up for 3 seconds then go off.. it kept doing it. which would frustrate people who want the battery to stay alive while at work. so i turned the phone off and back on and that issue is gone. the battery life is really good compared to other androids. but honestly i have played for probably 5-7 hours on and off through out a day and it was still at 38 percent. i just kept the screen brightness down. so really i love the phone but it has some glitches. could be the android 2.4.2 which i haven't updated yet because it wont update while roaming even though it is only roaming i believe because i haven't had it connected to verizon yet. but remember this is my experience. if i update the phone im sure the glitches will go away or be less of them."
"388170","Sony Ericsson Xperia PLAY Android Phone (Verizon Wireless)",5,"i bought it to flash it over to Cricket. Everything still works on it except of course the verizon stuff. i mainly use it to play PS1 and SNES games"

"388176","Sony Ericsson Xperia PLAY Android Phone (Verizon Wireless)",4,"Verizon no longer sells these and we needed to replace one that was damaged in a mud puddle. First time we didn't have the optional insurance and no upgrade available. So, even though the phone is on its way still, we are very happy. The new price even beat what Verizon was selling used ones for before they ran out."

"388495","Sony Xperia Acro S LT26W Unlocked Android Phone--U.S. Warranty (Black)",1,"Had high expectations for this Sony Xperia Acro phone which was known to be a well-built and solid phone. The moment I opened it after receiving it in the mail, I found the port door missing. How could have Sony missed this detail? What kind of Quality Control did Sony implement on this so-called flagship model? I was actually more amazed that annoyed by this and I did not even bother to turn on the phone. Good thing I bought it from Amazon which graciously accepted my return as a defective product. Thanks, Amazon. Wake up, Sony."
"388496","Sony Xperia Acro S LT26W Unlocked Android Phone--U.S. Warranty (Black)",1,"Poor quality.

"388498","Sony Xperia Acro S LT26W Unlocked Android Phone--U.S. Warranty (Black)",2,"After a few months playing with this phone i realize the water proof feature is the only thing going for this phone . Speaker phone volume is way too low , No removable battery ,but i knew that just didnt think it would be a pain in the rear when the phone freezes ,and it will freeze from time to time you can bet on that .I spent $100 on a Galaxy s3 from at&t after rooting and installing custom os the Galaxy was clearly the better phone even before i rooted it . At&t will recognize unlocked smart phones now so your going to pay the smartphone fee anyway might as well enjoy a better phone . Screen not as clear as one would think but still very clear . Kind of clunky in the hand maybe due to the sharp edges not being rounded or the back not being curved .If the phone goes dead from needing to be charged , when plugged in the phone turns on and off without charging over and over again until you get the phone turned on then plug the charger in , I have no clue whats up with that but i have an older SE Xperia Neo that does the same thing . NFC is only compatible with other Sony's so thats kinda worthless.I do like the water proof feature but thats about where it ends i have been a loyal Sony/ Ericsson customer since the SE 790a. I think im about done with Sony until they fix that annoying charging problem, start using removable batteries and turn up the WORTHLESS speakerphone .APN settings you will need to input manually , the auto settings loaded into the phone via setup wizard for AT&T are incorrect and will cause the internet connection to go in and out . Not a big issue just do a Google search for at&t apn settings and you will find the correct settings.Battery life - You will need to plug the phone up at least once during the day from a full charge in the morning or it will be ready to die by early afternoon.Screen display is NOT gorilla glass! Sony uses a scratch resistant mineral glass so get a screen protector period ! I am very careful with my phones but i am starting to see small scratches in the screen . My 3 year old Nokia with Gorilla glass has no scratches and has never had a screen protector.Volume rocker is in a terrible spot you will wonder why Sony did this every time you need to turn the volume up or down.Reception is great i get a good signal almost everywhere without issue .Call quality is good but you will understand very quickly why i use my bluetooth headset all the time .Phone froze the first week with a full charge and i didnt know what to do so i called Sony for help. Sony quickly answered and instructed me how to do a reset . Press & hold power + volume up until it resets and it was fine after that .Anyway you have been warned ."
"388499","Sony Xperia Acro S LT26W Unlocked Android Phone--U.S. Warranty (Black)",1,"This is a very nice phone The phone starts to rebooting itself a week ago. I have tried factory reset for 3 times but didnt solve the issue. Then I called Sony but the phone did not have US warranty. No replies from the seller HassaleFreeCell regarding this but no replies as of yet.Other than this problem this phone is great on ATT network. 12 MP camera is great under water."
"388500","Sony Xperia Acro S LT26W Unlocked Android Phone--U.S. Warranty (Black)",5,"I was made ​​anxious to get this phone, to open the box and see it I liked its size because it is a cell phone not too big but it is small. The colors in the photos are wooww look surprisingly like the pictures, very sharp and very bright colors. The phone has good signal on calls, I call like call me and hear my cell phone perfect. The battery has an acceptable duration. The operating system is android is switched on upgrading to a new version. Let's see how it goes behaving the phone over time. Caracas - Venezuela"
"388501","Sony Xperia Acro S LT26W Unlocked Android Phone--U.S. Warranty (Black)",5,"I purchased this device primarily as a replacement for my subsidized Motorola Droid 2 Global. That device is off contract this month, and was looking for an unlocked GSM-Based device that I could run on Straighttalk or similar service in the US. Important features for me were as follows:Unlocked GSM serviceUnlockable bootloader for potential customizationUSB OTGHigh quality displayHigh quality cameraBattery lifeSome sense of ruggednessI would say that it has lived up to my expectations thus far. I love the Camera. With average use, I am getting a bit more than a day out of the battery. Sony needs to be commended on their approach to open development platforms. They did provide the unlock code for the boot loader within the hour I requested it. The skin they provide to the Android OS is lightweight by default. While some feel the specs of this device are a bit behind, it has handled anything I have thrown at it. The software runs well and I am please with the performance. No lag or general slowdowns observed yet.While I like the device, it may not be for everyone. I have larger hands and some people may feel the device it a little thicker. I think that mostly has to do with IP57 water proof rating. One complaint that I would have is that the waterproof doors do get in the way and are a tad annoying for any wireless peripherals, including headphones. Luckily I have a nice bluetooth stereo headset. Another item which could be considered a con, is that the volume rocker is lower than it might otherwise be.Everyone should also be aware that this phone is not yet compatible with TMobile's (or there MVNO's) 3G networks in most US locales. I hear that T Mobile is in the process of migrating their 3G HSPA networks to the standard frequencies this device supports within the year. Otherwise you would be stuck to 2G rates for data.Overall I would recommend this device to most people. It has a premium feel and feature-set without the price tag of a premium unlocked device. Between the display, camera, and what this device can save me a month (prepaid services around $50/Month). It will pay for itself rather quickly."

"388584","Sony Xperia E C1504 Unlocked Android Phone--U.S. Warranty (Pink)",5,"One of the things I like about this cellphone is price/quality ration. It offers many good features for a relatively low price. On the other hand, I like the sophisticated appearance of this device, it is sober and simple but shows a nice style at the same time. It does not have a great storage capacity (2 GB) but you are able to increase the memory with a Micro sim memory, which is not really expensive. For, me it is fast enough, altough it may not be fast enough for people that like to have many applications ON at the same time, if you only need about 4 ""big"" applications on, like facebook, twitter, wassapp and gmail, it would work well."

"388648","Sony Xperia E C1504 Unlocked Android Phone--U.S. Warranty (Pink)",5,"This phone is not the best I have seen but when you consider the price it is the best Android phone compatible with AT&T 3G network and unlocked. Many cheap GSM phones do not support the frequencies used by AT$T.It is elegant looking with nice feel to it. Call quality (even in poor service areas) is excellent. Good speaker, OK screen, OK camera, great battery life. Not the fastest but I suspect it is more than enough for the average user. I tested data speed while tethering this phone to a PC and it clocks at 3.6mbs. That is almost the same as my Samsung 4G that cost 4 times more. The Bluetooth works much better than other phones I have had with great sound through my car stereo. I have been using it for a while now streaming internet radio while driving and that also works really well. Just buy it, you will love it if you don't expect it to work like a $400 phone."

"388650","Sony Xperia E C1504 Unlocked Android Phone--U.S. Warranty (Pink)",2,"Pros:* Compact size* Soft-touch plastic back is relatively non-slip* Low price point* No problems with audio quality or call connectivityCons:* Not enough storage for apps* Inadequate processing power and/or insufficient RAM (slow)* Camera is borderline useless* Low screen resolution* Sony ""Xperia"" value-add is underwhelmingThis was my first smartphone purchase and I wanted something compact, unlocked, and relatively inexpensive. I've had the Xperia E for several months now, and in retrospect I should have paid-up for more memory and processing power. This is a classic example of ""you get what you pay for."" The phone can be infuriatingly slow to respond, even to actions as seemingly simple as unlocking the screen with a PIN. The screen resolution is too low for some apps, making them difficult to use. The camera is only good for capturing still subjects in daylight.By far the most annoying feature of this phone is its small internal flash memory. 2GB seemed like it would be enough when I was shopping, since I had no intention of loading a bunch of media on it. Little did I know that only about 750MB is allocated to so-called ""phone memory,"" which is where most apps are stored. This severely limits my ability to install much beyond than the preloaded apps on the phone. Some apps can be moved to ""internal storage,"" and I have managed to uninstall / un-update some of the preloaded apps. Nevertheless, updating large apps such as Chrome is often a tedious process of clearing caches and temporarily uninstalling other apps in order to free enough storage perform the update. I'm sure with enough time and effort I could find a solution in some Android forum. Those who expect things to ""just work"" should move on."

I play golf and the weather app. is perfect for letting me know what to expect. There was a software update to be done which was straightforward to carry out.Love this phone and would recommend it.

"388702","Sony Xperia E C1504 Unlocked Android Phone--U.S. Warranty (Pink)",3,"I bought this to replace my Samsung Galaxy Y, which is not a bad phone but I kept running out of space on the actual phone. Even putting a 32gb sd card didn't help. It only has 128mb on the phone. Also the old phone had such a small screen that some things got cut off. Enough about my old phone. This new phone, this Sony phone, is great. Although does have some minor things that might get on my nerves. The main issue is that when you send texts and I automatically get a reply about message being relayed. Which was not an issue on the old phone but when doing a google on it. I found some black berries also having that issue with the same phone service that I have. it sounds like that is not something you can change at least nothing I can find says how to change that. I don't mind it being relayed I just don't want to be notified. Another issue is email notifications do not always work. I mean email works it just does not always seem to notify you. The gmail notifications do work. I did a google on that one as well and actually found some one talking about sony xperia but not this one, an older one. I am not sure which one he was talking about but he had this same issue and could not find a fix for it. He also suggested getting the Samsung Galaxy S3. I would get one of those but they are a lot more money then this phone.Any way I do like this phone even with the minor issues listed above. Oh wait I just remembered another issue that is not a major one either. This new phone does not work with my FM transmitter. I have no idea why either as it uses a standard head phone jack to connect to the phone. Any way again I do like the phone and I like that things are not cut off and I am not longer running out of room on the phone.Update to this review. I now give it 3 stars instead of 4. Main reason. Some times it will lock up and you have to remove the battery as none of the buttons work to get it to come back on correctly. It is a pain to remove the battery as well. Another issue is when the phone restarts either after pulling the battery or just restarting it. The phone comes back on and starts making random sounds. This is not my rington nor does it stop after a while. The first time it did this the thing made random sounds for almost an hour. I was on the other phone so could not pull my attention to trying to get it to stop instead I just covered it until I was off the other phone. I can stop it by swiping from the top to the bottom and hitting clear even if there is nothing to clear. This stops it. I have yet to figure out what causes this or why."

I tried it, everything works, but it is way slower in processing speed than the $350 nexus phone.. its a neat little nice designed phone, but lacks processing speed and memory... compared to the more expensive phones...its good phone for a back up phone.. but if you are a techy person and looking at pictures online and facebook, then maybe its best to upgrade to a more memory and faster processing chip... I guess you get what you pay for... but its really cheap at $100... so I guess I can't complain... the screen is slightly small too... but size wise the phone fits well in my pocket.."

"388720","Sony Xperia E C1504 Unlocked Android Phone--U.S. Warranty (Pink)",1,"Update 09/09/2014: I have had this phone for about a year now and it's f*ing HORRIBLE. It was alright at first, but it went down hill fast and hard!! I had to delete 90% of my apps b/c my phone keeps running out of memory. I take pictures on a rare occasion if I need to document something for work. Other than that, it just keeps somehow running out of room. I don't update it anymore b/c that takes up memory. It freezes up a few times a week. Sometimes It freezes WHEN MY ALARM IS GOING OFF!! So I have to take off my phone case and remove the battery. Very infuriating when you're just waking up. There's a lot of lag on the phone. Yes this phone may be cheap, but trust me when I say save your money. Buy a cheap, non-smart, nokia phone and save up your money for an actual good smart phone. As for this phone, BEWARE and STAY AWAY. If you do buy it, a few months later don't say I didn't warn you. . .Previous Review: February 26, 2014:The phone works (I'm stationed in Italy). I'm able to put a european sim card in it with no problem. It's not the best phone out there, but it works as a good smart phone. I only have a short time left on my tour and I didn't want to spend a lot of money on great smart phone (ie. galaxy S5 or Note 3), so I wanted to get a budget smart phone for internet usage.pros:-responsive touch screen-decent speed-SD card slot available for extra memory-great speakers-has most features you find on any smart phone-checking fb, email, bank accounts, etc runs smooth.cons:-low quality camera with no focus-decent speed-not a lot of internal memory-reception is ehh inside certain facilitiesAll in all, it's a great smartphone for someone on a budget. I've had better and worse. So if you're looking for a temp phone for not too much money, this is it."
"388721","Sony Xperia E C1504 Unlocked Android Phone--U.S. Warranty (Pink)",1,"I'd probably love this phone but the truth is it is now a pain and burden after loosing money on it. Yea, I said it. I bought this phone because I needed a smart phone I could take out in the field for work purposes. I also have to remove the camera for security reasons. Anyway, when opened the phone up I found the four main silver phillips screws stripped. Selling me a referbished phone at close to market value, good on you. Selling me one that was damaged in such a way to be useless, you suck."

I have texted1100 messages and a handful of times it has frozen, but, easily ""re-booted""...and, frankly, it has only happened when signal strength was poor. It compares to wife's 3GS and 4. There isn't another phone under $175 with US warranty that is better and at $126, it is 5 stars."

Pretty fast only had a couple times where the phone would ring and it would take a moment for it to show up on the screen so I could actually answer. You'll need a micro SD card for sure, I downloaded about 6 additional apps before it ran out of space and I couldn't even download some the updates because of the lack of space. Other than that its a great phone I would recommend it as a decent, cheap fully functional alternative to the more expensive smart phones."

Display is horrible...when you just turn on the phone the graphics that appear look great...nice, clear and crisp...but when the icons load they all look fuzzy..far from looking clear and crisp. The phone does not have much internal storage...download a few updates and you can't even download a small game on the phone.

"388819","Sony Xperia E C1504 Unlocked Android Phone--U.S. Warranty (Pink)",2,"The phone is fine if you have minimal use, but if you plan on using more than 3 downloaded apps, you'll run into trouble with the limited memory. It maxes out at 700MB of internal memory and some apps can't be moved to an SD card. On the other hand, it is unblocked and works well if you do pay as you go in several countries (I can only speak for the American continent)."

I am not 100% familiar with it, but so far it is a great little phone. I wanted a simple phone with out a lot of hassle. This phone is easy to use. The light weight and shape make it comfortable to hold. The screen is smaller than some other phones. My screen is only a little shorter than my husband's iphone 5. In all I am very satisfied with my Sony Xperia E C1504 and Xperia may be my phone of choice for future purchases!"

I inserted my current ATT sim card and away I went. Decent resolution and good call quality. The phone looks slick also. Just the right size for my pockets. Battery life is decent for moderate users like me. I was a little disappointed that the camera does not come with a flash, but the editing software allows for lightening darker photos satisfactorily. I didn't buy the phone for it's camera though. Great phone with nice features."

"388832","Sony Xperia E C1504 Unlocked Android Phone--U.S. Warranty (Pink)",3,"I popped my GoPhone (AT&T) SIM with the $35 plan into this when I got it and it worked right off the bat, no issues whatsoever. I opted to turn off data and simply use wifi for all of my internet needs. The only problem I had upon unboxing it was figuring out how to get the battery cover off, as the instructions are mostly just pictures and not very descriptive - I figured out that what you do is simply put your thumbs above the little speaker on the back and push up.People who are used to more powerful, more expensive phones might be a little disappointed. I previously had a phone that ran Android 2.2 and really wanted a phone that would support my credit union's app which allows me to take pictures of checks to deposit them (otherwise I have to drive 2+ hours) and this phone does that perfectly, even with the low-grade camera.I love the ""swiping"" option with the keyboard, I find it to be much easier to text that way, especially if I need to text with one hand. (No, not while driving).UPDATE 8/31/14: I had to knock off a couple points after having this phone for awhile. It lags and freezes up a lot. It will freeze, the screen will lock after 30 seconds, and then it will just not respond for awhile. You either have to pop the battery out and completely restart it or wait for it to get itself together. Certain apps seem to be the cause. Snapchat and Vine have so far been unsuccessful for me, they don't record video and cause the phone to freeze. Shazam works but takes FOREVER and sometimes causes the phone to freeze. A lot of games that I've downloaded are also pretty much unplayable due to the lagging, like Dots, Piano Tiles, and Temple Run. The Walkman app sometimes locks up too, it won't stop playing music but just won't respond when you press buttons.Apps that I have NOT had a problem with on this phone are Facebook, Pinterest, Pandora, Tumblr, Facebook Messenger, Indeed, Dropbox, Discover Mobile, Opera Mini, and Google Maps. I have to say, this phone is incredibly reliable when using it as a GPS with Google Maps.The microphone on the phone also stopped working for me this summer. I don't know if other people have had any issues with that, but I didn't take any points off because it's hard to tell if it was caused by something I did or not. I have gotten the phone wet and dropped it before. At first I just sounded really far away to people and then they weren't able to hear me at all and would just hang up on me. Now the only way I can make calls is with the headset, which, on the bright side, works great.Overall, I think there are other phones out there at this price that probably perform better."

Also, I purchased this to bring to my AT&T account and had absolutely no problems with it!

And guess what?...... it was a looked phone. I bought this phone to go back to my country with it, but now that I m here I realized that it was a locked phone (aka it does not work).Thank you amazon for waisting my money,I was furious becaause I asked to double ckeck but..... grrrrrrrrr"
"388871","Sony Xperia E C1504 Unlocked Android Phone--U.S. Warranty (Pink)",5,"One of the things I like about this cellphone is price/quality ration. It offers many good features for a relatively low price. On the other hand, I like the sophisticated appearance of this device, it is sober and simple but shows a nice style at the same time. It does not have a great storage capacity (2 GB) but you are able to increase the memory with a Micro sim memory, which is not really expensive. For, me it is fast enough, altough it may not be fast enough for people that like to have many applications ON at the same time, if you only need about 4 ""big"" applications on, like facebook, twitter, wassapp and gmail, it would work well."

The phone looked like it went skidding across a parking lot before being thrown back in the box and sent to me. The screen was all scratched up, and the corner was chipped off the phone's trim. The box was all beat up, and the manuals that came with it had writing throughout. I didn't expect perfection, but this phone was clearly rode hard and put away wet, on top of the fact that it wasn't shipped until after it's guaranteed delivery time. I was extremely disappointed in this purchase, and would give it zero stars if I could."

"388895","Sony Xperia E C1504 Unlocked Android Phone--U.S. Warranty (Pink)",5,"This phone is not the best I have seen but when you consider the price it is the best Android phone compatible with AT&T 3G network and unlocked. Many cheap GSM phones do not support the frequencies used by AT$T.It is elegant looking with nice feel to it. Call quality (even in poor service areas) is excellent. Good speaker, OK screen, OK camera, great battery life. Not the fastest but I suspect it is more than enough for the average user. I tested data speed while tethering this phone to a PC and it clocks at 3.6mbs. That is almost the same as my Samsung 4G that cost 4 times more. The Bluetooth works much better than other phones I have had with great sound through my car stereo. I have been using it for a while now streaming internet radio while driving and that also works really well. Just buy it, you will love it if you don't expect it to work like a $400 phone."
"388896","Sony Xperia E C1504 Unlocked Android Phone--U.S. Warranty (Pink)",5,"It is a very nice device for the price. It is a little slow on RAM but otherwise it fits my needs."
"388897","Sony Xperia E C1504 Unlocked Android Phone--U.S. Warranty (Pink)",2,"Pros:* Compact size* Soft-touch plastic back is relatively non-slip* Low price point* No problems with audio quality or call connectivityCons:* Not enough storage for apps* Inadequate processing power and/or insufficient RAM (slow)* Camera is borderline useless* Low screen resolution* Sony ""Xperia"" value-add is underwhelmingThis was my first smartphone purchase and I wanted something compact, unlocked, and relatively inexpensive. I've had the Xperia E for several months now, and in retrospect I should have paid-up for more memory and processing power. This is a classic example of ""you get what you pay for."" The phone can be infuriatingly slow to respond, even to actions as seemingly simple as unlocking the screen with a PIN. The screen resolution is too low for some apps, making them difficult to use. The camera is only good for capturing still subjects in daylight.By far the most annoying feature of this phone is its small internal flash memory. 2GB seemed like it would be enough when I was shopping, since I had no intention of loading a bunch of media on it. Little did I know that only about 750MB is allocated to so-called ""phone memory,"" which is where most apps are stored. This severely limits my ability to install much beyond than the preloaded apps on the phone. Some apps can be moved to ""internal storage,"" and I have managed to uninstall / un-update some of the preloaded apps. Nevertheless, updating large apps such as Chrome is often a tedious process of clearing caches and temporarily uninstalling other apps in order to free enough storage perform the update. I'm sure with enough time and effort I could find a solution in some Android forum. Those who expect things to ""just work"" should move on."

I can't have it on airplane mode and use the FM radio?

"388937","Sony Xperia E C1504 Unlocked Android Phone--U.S. Warranty (Pink)",3,"I bought this phone last winter. It has survived numerous drops, even though it is small and not too thick (I bought a case for it on Amazon a few month ago though). I use this phone mainly for leisure purposes. You can install most of the apps from Google Play. It only has a 3.2 MP camera, so don't expect to take spectacular photos. It does take nice pictures in the day or with lots of light.My main issues: If you don't close out unused apps, the phone slows down significantly. It can just be one other app and it starts to crawl. On two different occasions, the phone erased my songs and pictures. They were sent to lost.dir and I had to manually rename each picture and song on my computer and then put them back on the phone. Some of the pictures were damaged and were permanently lost. The headphones that came with the phone didn't last long. I've tried several headphones, but the phone doesn't recognize most of them.If it wasn't for the phone surviving drops without cracking, I would have gave it a much lower rating."

The phone storage is low, using a SSD card is essential but doesn't totally help with all the apps, the camera is way low compared to what they can do (3.8 mp), but the screen is vivid and the sound is good, the in-call sound is clear and so is the pick up on the mic. It is simple to operate and to get to know. If you just want one to do basic stuff this is perfect for the price, but if you want a do it all phone try a Xperia TL or Z"

Display is horrible...when you just turn on the phone the graphics that appear look great...nice, clear and crisp...but when the icons load they all look fuzzy..far from looking clear and crisp. The phone does not have much internal storage...download a few updates and you can't even download a small game on the phone.

I try to close the apps so it doesn't get slow, it's fast and really cute, I love the light that syncs with the apps and the different messages and pictures. I live in Venezuela and the phone came in Spanish, latin Spanish wich is a plus, i use it with Digitel and it works well.I recommend this phone with my eyes closed, it works really good comparing it with the low price"
"389054","Sony Xperia E C1504 Unlocked Android Phone--U.S. Warranty (White)",5,"This is my first android phone having had a basic call and text service.

I play golf and the weather app. is perfect for letting me know what to expect. There was a software update to be done which was straightforward to carry out.Love this phone and would recommend it.

I have sony pretty much everything for my consumer electronics, and though this is not as sexy as my Xperia SL, it is plenty to be satisfied with where it's priced at. Deduct a star for the tiny screen & the bit outdated android & 3G. Otherwise, love it. :D"
"389060","Sony Xperia E C1504 Unlocked Android Phone--U.S. Warranty (White)",3,"swipe function is not that smart, no front camera, setting is confusing, touch screen not very sensitive, long lasting battery"
"389061","Sony Xperia E C1504 Unlocked Android Phone--U.S. Warranty (White)",3,"I bought this to replace my Samsung Galaxy Y, which is not a bad phone but I kept running out of space on the actual phone. Even putting a 32gb sd card didn't help. It only has 128mb on the phone. Also the old phone had such a small screen that some things got cut off. Enough about my old phone. This new phone, this Sony phone, is great. Although does have some minor things that might get on my nerves. The main issue is that when you send texts and I automatically get a reply about message being relayed. Which was not an issue on the old phone but when doing a google on it. I found some black berries also having that issue with the same phone service that I have. it sounds like that is not something you can change at least nothing I can find says how to change that. I don't mind it being relayed I just don't want to be notified. Another issue is email notifications do not always work. I mean email works it just does not always seem to notify you. The gmail notifications do work. I did a google on that one as well and actually found some one talking about sony xperia but not this one, an older one. I am not sure which one he was talking about but he had this same issue and could not find a fix for it. He also suggested getting the Samsung Galaxy S3. I would get one of those but they are a lot more money then this phone.Any way I do like this phone even with the minor issues listed above. Oh wait I just remembered another issue that is not a major one either. This new phone does not work with my FM transmitter. I have no idea why either as it uses a standard head phone jack to connect to the phone. Any way again I do like the phone and I like that things are not cut off and I am not longer running out of room on the phone.Update to this review. I now give it 3 stars instead of 4. Main reason. Some times it will lock up and you have to remove the battery as none of the buttons work to get it to come back on correctly. It is a pain to remove the battery as well. Another issue is when the phone restarts either after pulling the battery or just restarting it. The phone comes back on and starts making random sounds. This is not my rington nor does it stop after a while. The first time it did this the thing made random sounds for almost an hour. I was on the other phone so could not pull my attention to trying to get it to stop instead I just covered it until I was off the other phone. I can stop it by swiping from the top to the bottom and hitting clear even if there is nothing to clear. This stops it. I have yet to figure out what causes this or why."

The phone looked like it went skidding across a parking lot before being thrown back in the box and sent to me. The screen was all scratched up, and the corner was chipped off the phone's trim. The box was all beat up, and the manuals that came with it had writing throughout. I didn't expect perfection, but this phone was clearly rode hard and put away wet, on top of the fact that it wasn't shipped until after it's guaranteed delivery time.

It was alright at first, but it went down hill fast and hard!! I had to delete 90% of my apps b/c my phone keeps running out of memory. I take pictures on a rare occasion if I need to document something for work. Other than that, it just keeps somehow running out of room. I don't update it anymore b/c that takes up memory. It freezes up a few times a week. Sometimes It freezes WHEN MY ALARM IS GOING OFF!! So I have to take off my phone case and remove the battery. Very infuriating when you're just waking up. There's a lot of lag on the phone. Yes this phone may be cheap, but trust me when I say save your money. Buy a cheap, non-smart, nokia phone and save up your money for an actual good smart phone. As for this phone, BEWARE and STAY AWAY. If you do buy it, a few months later don't say I didn't warn you. . .Previous Review: February 26, 2014:The phone works (I'm stationed in Italy). I'm able to put a european sim card in it with no problem. It's not the best phone out there, but it works as a good smart phone. I only have a short time left on my tour and I didn't want to spend a lot of money on great smart phone (ie. galaxy S5 or Note 3), so I wanted to get a budget smart phone for internet usage.pros:-responsive touch screen-decent speed-SD card slot available for extra memory-great speakers-has most features you find on any smart phone-checking fb, email, bank accounts, etc runs smooth.cons:-low quality camera with no focus-decent speed-not a lot of internal memory-reception is ehh inside certain facilitiesAll in all, it's a great smartphone for someone on a budget. I've had better and worse. So if you're looking for a temp phone for not too much money, this is it."
"389120","Sony Xperia E C1504 Unlocked Android Phone--U.S. Warranty (White)",1,"I'd probably love this phone but the truth is it is now a pain and burden after loosing money on it. Yea, I said it. I bought this phone because I needed a smart phone I could take out in the field for work purposes. I also have to remove the camera for security reasons. Anyway, when opened the phone up I found the four main silver phillips screws stripped. Selling me a referbished phone at close to market value, good on you. Selling me one that was damaged in such a way to be useless, you suck."
"389121","Sony Xperia E C1504 Unlocked Android Phone--U.S. Warranty (White)",4,"I just got it and it was easy to move over my Sim chip to the phone. The phone will take a little time to learn more about it. yet, Its much better then the phone you see all over the place."
"389122","Sony Xperia E C1504 Unlocked Android Phone--U.S. Warranty (White)",2,"This phone was great for the first month. Now it freezes, lags and doesn't work properly only 5 months later. It rings when I have it set to vibrate only, and it doesn't ring at all when I have the ringer on! HORRIBLE phone! It will be used as a frisbee very VERY soon!"

"389146","Sony Xperia E C1504 Unlocked Android Phone--U.S. Warranty (White)",3,"I bought this phone last winter. It has survived numerous drops, even though it is small and not too thick (I bought a case for it on Amazon a few month ago though). I use this phone mainly for leisure purposes. You can install most of the apps from Google Play. It only has a 3.2 MP camera, so don't expect to take spectacular photos. It does take nice pictures in the day or with lots of light.My main issues: If you don't close out unused apps, the phone slows down significantly. It can just be one other app and it starts to crawl. On two different occasions, the phone erased my songs and pictures. They were sent to lost.dir and I had to manually rename each picture and song on my computer and then put them back on the phone. Some of the pictures were damaged and were permanently lost. The headphones that came with the phone didn't last long. I've tried several headphones, but the phone doesn't recognize most of them.If it wasn't for the phone surviving drops without cracking, I would have gave it a much lower rating."

"389154","Sony Xperia E C1504 Unlocked Android Phone--U.S. Warranty (White)",3,"The phone is OK. It's very durable when dropped (it happens to me quite often), but all the built-in apps are annoying, because they leave little room for apps I actually choose to put on the phone, and I ed up running out of memory often enough."

I would not recommend unless you dont plan on taking any pictures, or downloading more than three or four apps. that is assuming the problem i had with the connection was unique to me."

"389180","Sony Xperia E C1504 Unlocked Android Phone--U.S. Warranty (White)",3,"This phone is ok, main issue is it does not have enough internal memory if you are running several apps...I downloaded a few apps, and already running out of internal memory..However, for the price is a good phone if you just want the super basic phone..I'm using this phone as a temporary phone... until the new models come out in August..I used to have a Nexus 4, but I dropped it while getting out of the car and the screen broke, so I had to get a new phone in a hurry, this one seemed to meet the budget... I tried it, everything works, but it is way slower in processing speed than the $350 nexus phone.. its a neat little nice designed phone, but lacks processing speed and memory... compared to the more expensive phones...its good phone for a back up phone.. but if you are a techy person and looking at pictures online and facebook, then maybe its best to upgrade to a more memory and faster processing chip... I guess you get what you pay for... but its really cheap at $100... so I guess I can't complain... the screen is slightly small too... but size wise the phone fits well in my pocket.."

"389183","Sony Xperia E C1504 Unlocked Android Phone--U.S. Warranty (White)",3,"Good product. but this phone system has difficulty wire the files to the larger memory and internal memory is very low. But it is not a distress if you want a mid-range phone."

"389188","Sony Xperia E C1504 Unlocked Android Phone--U.S. Warranty (White)",2,"The phone is fine if you have minimal use, but if you plan on using more than 3 downloaded apps, you'll run into trouble with the limited memory. It maxes out at 700MB of internal memory and some apps can't be moved to an SD card. On the other hand, it is unblocked and works well if you do pay as you go in several countries (I can only speak for the American continent)."

The phone itself is pretty modern, very sleek, latest apps."

"389195","Sony Xperia E C1504 Unlocked Android Phone--U.S. Warranty (White)",3,"You will get a device with android 4.1, that's okay. But with awful display and no flash perphaps it will be smart find other phone."

I have texted1100 messages and a handful of times it has frozen, but, easily ""re-booted""...and, frankly, it has only happened when signal strength was poor. It compares to wife's 3GS and 4. There isn't another phone under $175 with US warranty that is better and at $126, it is 5 stars."
"389201","Sony Xperia E C1504 Unlocked Android Phone--U.S. Warranty (White)",5,"This is my first time using android, and i'm loving it. I'm not much of a tech girl so this phone works just perfect for me. I try to close the apps so it doesn't get slow, it's fast and really cute, I love the light that syncs with the apps and the different messages and pictures. I live in Venezuela and the phone came in Spanish, latin Spanish wich is a plus, i use it with Digitel and it works well.I recommend this phone with my eyes closed, it works really good comparing it with the low price"

Display is horrible...when you just turn on the phone the graphics that appear look great...nice, clear and crisp...but when the icons load they all look fuzzy..far from looking clear and crisp. The phone does not have much internal storage...download a few updates and you can't even download a small game on the phone.

I would recommend this phone to anybody who doesn't care much about built-in phone memory. The phone's built-in memory is 4GB. However, it could also handle a 32GB memory card."
"389261","Sony Xperia E C1504 Unlocked Android Phone--U.S. Warranty (White)",4,"Great Android phone for its price. Pretty fast only had a couple times where the phone would ring and it would take a moment for it to show up on the screen so I could actually answer. You'll need a micro SD card for sure, I downloaded about 6 additional apps before it ran out of space and I couldn't even download some the updates because of the lack of space. Other than that its a great phone I would recommend it as a decent, cheap fully functional alternative to the more expensive smart phones."

The phone storage is low, using a SSD card is essential but doesn't totally help with all the apps, the camera is way low compared to what they can do (3.8 mp), but the screen is vivid and the sound is good, the in-call sound is clear and so is the pick up on the mic. It is simple to operate and to get to know. If you just want one to do basic stuff this is perfect for the price, but if you want a do it all phone try a Xperia TL or Z"

"389274","Sony Xperia E C1504 Unlocked Android Phone--U.S. Warranty (White)",5,"This phone is not the best I have seen but when you consider the price it is the best Android phone compatible with AT&T 3G network and unlocked. Many cheap GSM phones do not support the frequencies used by AT$T.It is elegant looking with nice feel to it. Call quality (even in poor service areas) is excellent. Good speaker, OK screen, OK camera, great battery life. Not the fastest but I suspect it is more than enough for the average user. I tested data speed while tethering this phone to a PC and it clocks at 3.6mbs. That is almost the same as my Samsung 4G that cost 4 times more. The Bluetooth works much better than other phones I have had with great sound through my car stereo. I have been using it for a while now streaming internet radio while driving and that also works really well. Just buy it, you will love it if you don't expect it to work like a $400 phone."
"389275","Sony Xperia E C1504 Unlocked Android Phone--U.S. Warranty (White)",5,"It is a very nice device for the price. It is a little slow on RAM but otherwise it fits my needs."
"389276","Sony Xperia E C1504 Unlocked Android Phone--U.S. Warranty (White)",2,"Pros:* Compact size* Soft-touch plastic back is relatively non-slip* Low price point* No problems with audio quality or call connectivityCons:* Not enough storage for apps* Inadequate processing power and/or insufficient RAM (slow)* Camera is borderline useless* Low screen resolution* Sony ""Xperia"" value-add is underwhelmingThis was my first smartphone purchase and I wanted something compact, unlocked, and relatively inexpensive. I've had the Xperia E for several months now, and in retrospect I should have paid-up for more memory and processing power. This is a classic example of ""you get what you pay for."" The phone can be infuriatingly slow to respond, even to actions as seemingly simple as unlocking the screen with a PIN. The screen resolution is too low for some apps, making them difficult to use. The camera is only good for capturing still subjects in daylight.By far the most annoying feature of this phone is its small internal flash memory. 2GB seemed like it would be enough when I was shopping, since I had no intention of loading a bunch of media on it. Little did I know that only about 750MB is allocated to so-called ""phone memory,"" which is where most apps are stored. This severely limits my ability to install much beyond than the preloaded apps on the phone. Some apps can be moved to ""internal storage,"" and I have managed to uninstall / un-update some of the preloaded apps. Nevertheless, updating large apps such as Chrome is often a tedious process of clearing caches and temporarily uninstalling other apps in order to free enough storage perform the update. I'm sure with enough time and effort I could find a solution in some Android forum. Those who expect things to ""just work"" should move on."

I can't have it on airplane mode and use the FM radio? This makes no sense...)Slow (maybe it's because I'm running my mp3s off a sd card, but sometimes it takes forever to skip, pause, stop, etc)Bloatware"

I play golf and the weather app. is perfect for letting me know what to expect. There was a software update to be done which was straightforward to carry out.Love this phone and would recommend it.

I have sony pretty much everything for my consumer electronics, and though this is not as sexy as my Xperia SL, it is plenty to be satisfied with where it's priced at. Deduct a star for the tiny screen & the bit outdated android & 3G. Otherwise, love it. :D"
"389288","Sony Xperia E C1504 Unlocked Android Phone--U.S. Warranty (White)",3,"swipe function is not that smart, no front camera, setting is confusing, touch screen not very sensitive, long lasting battery"
"389289","Sony Xperia E C1504 Unlocked Android Phone--U.S. Warranty (White)",3,"I bought this to replace my Samsung Galaxy Y, which is not a bad phone but I kept running out of space on the actual phone. Even putting a 32gb sd card didn't help. It only has 128mb on the phone. Also the old phone had such a small screen that some things got cut off. Enough about my old phone. This new phone, this Sony phone, is great. Although does have some minor things that might get on my nerves. The main issue is that when you send texts and I automatically get a reply about message being relayed. Which was not an issue on the old phone but when doing a google on it. I found some black berries also having that issue with the same phone service that I have. it sounds like that is not something you can change at least nothing I can find says how to change that. I don't mind it being relayed I just don't want to be notified. Another issue is email notifications do not always work. I mean email works it just does not always seem to notify you. The gmail notifications do work. I did a google on that one as well and actually found some one talking about sony xperia but not this one, an older one. I am not sure which one he was talking about but he had this same issue and could not find a fix for it. He also suggested getting the Samsung Galaxy S3. I would get one of those but they are a lot more money then this phone.Any way I do like this phone even with the minor issues listed above. Oh wait I just remembered another issue that is not a major one either. This new phone does not work with my FM transmitter. I have no idea why either as it uses a standard head phone jack to connect to the phone. Any way again I do like the phone and I like that things are not cut off and I am not longer running out of room on the phone.Update to this review. I now give it 3 stars instead of 4. Main reason. Some times it will lock up and you have to remove the battery as none of the buttons work to get it to come back on correctly. It is a pain to remove the battery as well. Another issue is when the phone restarts either after pulling the battery or just restarting it. The phone comes back on and starts making random sounds. This is not my rington nor does it stop after a while. The first time it did this the thing made random sounds for almost an hour. I was on the other phone so could not pull my attention to trying to get it to stop instead I just covered it until I was off the other phone. I can stop it by swiping from the top to the bottom and hitting clear even if there is nothing to clear. This stops it. I have yet to figure out what causes this or why."

I am not 100% familiar with it, but so far it is a great little phone. I wanted a simple phone with out a lot of hassle. This phone is easy to use. The light weight and shape make it comfortable to hold. The screen is smaller than some other phones. My screen is only a little shorter than my husband's iphone 5. In all I am very satisfied with my Sony Xperia E C1504 and Xperia may be my phone of choice for future purchases!"

Battery life is decent for moderate users like me. I was a little disappointed that the camera does not come with a flash, but the editing software allows for lightening darker photos satisfactorily.

"389309","Sony Xperia E C1504 Unlocked Android Phone--U.S. Warranty (White)",3,"I popped my GoPhone (AT&T) SIM with the $35 plan into this when I got it and it worked right off the bat, no issues whatsoever. I opted to turn off data and simply use wifi for all of my internet needs. The only problem I had upon unboxing it was figuring out how to get the battery cover off, as the instructions are mostly just pictures and not very descriptive - I figured out that what you do is simply put your thumbs above the little speaker on the back and push up.People who are used to more powerful, more expensive phones might be a little disappointed. I previously had a phone that ran Android 2.2 and really wanted a phone that would support my credit union's app which allows me to take pictures of checks to deposit them (otherwise I have to drive 2+ hours) and this phone does that perfectly, even with the low-grade camera.I love the ""swiping"" option with the keyboard, I find it to be much easier to text that way, especially if I need to text with one hand. (No, not while driving).UPDATE 8/31/14: I had to knock off a couple points after having this phone for awhile. It lags and freezes up a lot. It will freeze, the screen will lock after 30 seconds, and then it will just not respond for awhile. You either have to pop the battery out and completely restart it or wait for it to get itself together. Certain apps seem to be the cause. Snapchat and Vine have so far been unsuccessful for me, they don't record video and cause the phone to freeze. Shazam works but takes FOREVER and sometimes causes the phone to freeze. A lot of games that I've downloaded are also pretty much unplayable due to the lagging, like Dots, Piano Tiles, and Temple Run. The Walkman app sometimes locks up too, it won't stop playing music but just won't respond when you press buttons.Apps that I have NOT had a problem with on this phone are Facebook, Pinterest, Pandora, Tumblr, Facebook Messenger, Indeed, Dropbox, Discover Mobile, Opera Mini, and Google Maps. I have to say, this phone is incredibly reliable when using it as a GPS with Google Maps.The microphone on the phone also stopped working for me this summer. I don't know if other people have had any issues with that, but I didn't take any points off because it's hard to tell if it was caused by something I did or not. I have gotten the phone wet and dropped it before. At first I just sounded really far away to people and then they weren't able to hear me at all and would just hang up on me. Now the only way I can make calls is with the headset, which, on the bright side, works great.Overall, I think there are other phones out there at this price that probably perform better."

I bought this item and I called the customer service of Amazon to ask if it was unlocked (even though nothing was written on it) and she confirmed that it was. And guess what?...... it was a looked phone. I bought this phone to go back to my country with it, but now that I m here I realized that it was a locked phone (aka it does not work).Thank you amazon for waisting my money,I was furious becaause I asked to double ckeck but..... grrrrrrrrr"
"389358","Sony Xperia E C1504 Unlocked Android Phone--U.S. Warranty (White)",5,"One of the things I like about this cellphone is price/quality ration. It offers many good features for a relatively low price. On the other hand, I like the sophisticated appearance of this device, it is sober and simple but shows a nice style at the same time. It does not have a great storage capacity (2 GB) but you are able to increase the memory with a Micro sim memory, which is not really expensive. For, me it is fast enough, altough it may not be fast enough for people that like to have many applications ON at the same time, if you only need about 4 ""big"" applications on, like facebook, twitter, wassapp and gmail, it would work well."

Great for me as I have two numbers. The only downsides for me are 1) Not super durable. The back is just plastic, and it'll probably break/scratch real bad if you don't have it in a case. 2) Not very much memory. At all. Get an extra memory card. Other than that, very happy with it :)"
"389387","Sony Xperia E C1604 Dual-SIM Unlocked Android Phone--U.S. Warranty (Black)",5,"Not the best phone ever but it works the only error i noticed is that you have to switch sims (if you are using dual) every time you want to call from a different sim you need to set a default one but it's a nice and cheap cellphone btw nice ram & calibration ! :)"

"389390","Sony Xperia E C1604 Dual-SIM Unlocked Android Phone--U.S. Warranty (Black)",1,"I would say that I am a bit of a Sony fan as I tend to purchase a lot of things they make. I've been buying Sony phones for a while and I really wanted to buy the Xperia C dual sim but couldn't due to time constraints as I was leaving the country for an extended period of time, so I went with the Xperia E dual sim. I will say this phone has been nothing but a disappointment.The moment I turned the phone on, I noticed I had an update available and updated the phone to JellyBean 4.1.1. From then on, the phone would randomly crash and restart. It then started crashing and restarting whenever the phone screen locked and I tried to unlock it. It would sometimes happen when I used the slide or entered the pin, it didn't really matter which method I tried, it would crash and restart.I have used PC companion to repair the installation several times, as well as Sony's update service and yet the issue exists. At this point, I need to return the phone but physically cannot."
"389391","Sony Xperia E C1604 Dual-SIM Unlocked Android Phone--U.S. Warranty (Black)",5,"For the price, it's a very complete phone. I really didn't expect it to be such a versatile and nice.And has all I need on it! Just loving it!"
"389392","Sony Xperia E C1604 Dual-SIM Unlocked Android Phone--U.S. Warranty (Black)",5,"I choose this rating after using the phone.

For the price of one phone I replaced two.Anyone who has two phones should replace them with this one. Android 4.1.1 is greeaatt also."

"389395","Sony Xperia E C1604 Dual-SIM Unlocked Android Phone--U.S. Warranty (Black)",2,"For this price, it's a great value. It does almost all that my girlfriend's iPhone 4s does, and more. It is not as fast and responsive as the iPhone, the camera and the sound are also not as good, but it does the job. The screen size is identical to the iPhone, and the screen resolution seems to be the same. I installed a lot of apps on it, and so far have not run out of memory (unlike with my previous phone that had Android 2.3 on it). It came with Android 4.0, and recently was updated to 4.1. So far I have not found any use of the dual SIM card capability, but it could come handy on my next European trip if I buy a local SIM card there. That's the way to save on phone bills while overseas. Highly recommended.After a few months of use, I change my mind about this phone. Too slow. I hate it now. I bought a Nokia Lumia 635 instead. Much better."
"389396","Sony Xperia E C1604 Dual-SIM Unlocked Android Phone--U.S. Warranty (Black)",5,"item was exactly as described, shipment was fast. I liked the phone pretty much. It's a great dual simcard with outstanding feature yet a combact size.."
"389397","Sony Xperia E C1604 Dual-SIM Unlocked Android Phone--U.S. Warranty (Black)",1,"Pros:- Dual Sim Capable- Responsive, doesn't feel slow and the UI looks nice- Phone design looks good, not ugly for a budget smart phone- microSD slot- Lightweight- Call quality (good even on International calls)Neutrals (features expected for a $150 smart phone):- Screen quality/resolution is average (320 x 480 pixels, 3.5 inches. 165 ppi pixel density)- Single core CPU (1 GHz Cortex-A5)- Memory is OK (4 GB, 2 GB user available. 512 MB RAM)- Battery Life is OK (not great but not bad either)Cons:- Dual Sims aren't very useful.- Only SIM1 is 3G capable, SIM2 is 2G only- Camera is useless, very poor quality pictures in most situations. Mediocre pictures in good light- Phone would lock-up if a call was made on one of the SIMs and it was ended before the other other party answered.- Random phone radio/dialer lock-ups (phone looks like it is working but no incoming or outgoing calls)- Random phone restarts- Phone doesn't shutdown after a lock-up, only fix is to remove the batteryThese problems were with NO 3rd party apps installed. Just what was on the phone itself.I regret buying this phone, it would have been better to just use 2 phones rather than this phone. It was bought so we could use it when traveling internationally. The Samsung dual SIM phones all supported 3G only on SIM1 (unlike Sony, Samsung was honest and stated this in their specifications). This phone just like the Samsung phones has one 3G radio which is for SIM1 only.In most countries 3G wouldn't matter for voice calls but if you travel to Japan or South Korea you need a 3G phone/radio, 2G doesn't work at all. Which is why I wanted a dual sim phone that supports 3G on both SIMs. I only found out of this problem while the phone was in Japan, SIM2 radio didn't work at all in Japan. This combined with the radio/dialer lock-up issue caused major problems.This phone was used by my mother (she knows how to use an Android phone just not troubleshoot it) and she had an awful experience with it. The phone lock-up and 3G radio issues left the phone inoperable for long periods during her trip. This made it impossible to communicate since we didn't know what was happening. The phone would work sometimes and not others. We tried several SIMs thinking it was a problem with the wireless service providers. What we didn't realize was that the phone worked for a little while because the battery was taken out and put back in during SIM swaps.This phone caused lots of stress for my mother & others trying to communicate with her during the trip and on her return. The day of her return she spent over two hours waiting at the airport after traveling for over 22 hours. Her flight was early, airport staff routed some passengers through a different terminal she thought we hadn't arrived yet and waited for us thinking we weren't at the airport yet. We arrived early as well because we saw that the flight was ahead of its schedule. We waited for her thinking customs/immigration might be taking time. We tried calling her but couldn't reach her since the phone was locked-up. She tried shutting down the phone (it never shutoff the phone was locked-up). She tried calling us but no calls went through, she thought the wireless service providers were the issue. Luckily she got tried of waiting and a couple of Good Samaritans helped her out, they called me for her so I was able to find her.Save yourself lots of headaches and stress, don't buy this phone."
"389398","Sony Xperia E C1604 Dual-SIM Unlocked Android Phone--U.S. Warranty (Black)",5,"So far, so good. Have had it for just a couple of weeks.

"389414","Sony Xperia E C1604 Dual-SIM Unlocked Android Phone--U.S. Warranty (Black)",2,"I use both SIMs - one for professional and one for friends. It's clumsy to inform the phone which SIM one wishes to call or send from. One has to go deep into ""settings"" to switch the ""default"" SIM. Further, incoming text messages to one SIM (phone number) get blended with the messages incoming to the other SIM (phone number). Voice mail is the worst. After one listens to voice mail from one SIM, the ""message waiting"" icon goes off, and one has to go change the default SIM, then check voice mail for the other SIM because there may be unheard messages there.Later: I have to be honest. I found a better way to switch the ""default"" SIM - Slide the main screen to the left and change it there. No solution for the voice mail or message problem though. This phone was put on the market in 2013, and once the alarm goes off - it cannot be silenced if one has it in one's pocket and touches the screen getting it out unless one totally shuts the phone off (holding on-off button for 6 seconds). One would think they would have fixed that by this time."

"389456","Sony Xperia E C1604 Dual-SIM Unlocked Android Phone--U.S. Warranty (Black)",1,"I am not picky. I am not a big review writer. This is a warning.I bought this xperia to replace a low end samsung gravity whose screen i had cracked. This phone got decent reviews on androidandme.com and the price seemed right, esp for android 4+. Unfortunately:. This phone is painfully slow. Much slower than my old samsung which was android 2+. Imagine every time you press a button or swipe. Then wait many seconds. Sometimes 30 seconds. Then you are about to hit the back/escape button to start over when you see the operation has finally gone through. This happens many times a day. A simpler example: your phone rings, you swipe to answer, then you have to stare at the screen a few seconds to make sure the call has gone through.. I thought i would get a lot more functionality with the higher android but i havent.. The screen is dark and muddy. Even on the brightest setting it's hard to see.. It has a very clunky low end look and feel. Cost $150 looks $50.. Dont make the same mistake i did, thinking you just have to get used to the new phone. Its the phone not you. Now its too late for me to return phone.. Im on a budget. At the time i bought this junk the google nexus 4 was $300. Now its a great buy at $200. I wish i could have that instead. If youre on a stricter budget get a blu phone for about $80. People seem to like it. Skip this xperia pr you will regret it."

I sought additional help through my internet carrier and was quickly able to connect to the Wi-Fi. Since then the phone has worked fine and more than met my hopes and expectations for a cell phone without the high price of an Iphone. Its an excellent product which I would recommend."

"389483","Sony Xperia E C1604 Dual-SIM Unlocked Android Phone--U.S. Warranty (Black)",2,"You get what you pay for, I know. For a $150 unlocked smart phone, it does everything you could expect. It's got decent battery life, runs a little slow, and is small and lightweight. My only real complaint is that the phone I received has a fixed focus camera, which is essentially useless. The description clearly states that the camera has auto focus, so I feel misled. Unfortunately I didn't notice this false advertising until after my return window had closed.Edit: I came back to say that I've upgraded to the Moto G, another low-price unlocked smartphone but it is WORLDS better. Makes the Sony look miserable by comparison. Do yourself a favor and do not get this phone."

She didn't need anything fancy, but I wanted to make sure her new phone had a newer version of Android as we plan to keep them for a few years. She likes it, and it does everything she wants it to do (which honestly, isn't much). Runs smoothly enough, and has great battery life if your aren't a hard user.One thing that would bother me if it were mine is the screen resolution. You can definitely tell that this is a budget phone. Fortunately, my wife doesn't really care that much."
"389488","Sony Xperia E C1604 Dual-SIM Unlocked Android Phone--U.S. Warranty (Black)",4,"until now working good, but this is a basic smartphone, so sometimes the internet is a little slow.i have 2 sim cards so it is an excellent option to manage 2 lines in a single phone, especially with prepaid plans (per minute, per text).battery life could be better, you will need to recharge it almost every day, since when the phone is about 10% some functions just turn off and could be annoying."
"389489","Sony Xperia E C1604 Dual-SIM Unlocked Android Phone--U.S. Warranty (Black)",2,"I brought this phone because I wanted a (respected phone brand) dual sim with Android 4.1-Jelly Bean, the description states Jelly bean but the phone came with Android 4.0-Icecream, Sony released an update to 4.1-jelly bean for the Xperia E Dual but apparently its for the version C1605 not C1604.

It's okay if you don't plan to add Apps and have too many contacts. In my case when I synchronized with my Outlook contacts, which is big, the phone froze, so I had to delete it all. Together with this phone I received a Sony SmartWatch2, however this phone only accepts a few of the Apps developed for this watch. If you plan to use this dual SIM Card phone, just as a plain phone, go ahead, it will be okay. If you plan to use is as a smartphone look for a higher end device."

"389533","Sony Xperia E C1604 Dual-SIM Unlocked Android Phone--U.S. Warranty (Black)",2,"I use both SIMs - one for professional and one for friends. It's clumsy to inform the phone which SIM one wishes to call or send from. One has to go deep into ""settings"" to switch the ""default"" SIM. Further, incoming text messages to one SIM (phone number) get blended with the messages incoming to the other SIM (phone number). Voice mail is the worst. After one listens to voice mail from one SIM, the ""message waiting"" icon goes off, and one has to go change the default SIM, then check voice mail for the other SIM because there may be unheard messages there.Later: I have to be honest. I found a better way to switch the ""default"" SIM - Slide the main screen to the left and change it there. No solution for the voice mail or message problem though. This phone was put on the market in 2013, and once the alarm goes off - it cannot be silenced if one has it in one's pocket and touches the screen getting it out unless one totally shuts the phone off (holding on-off button for 6 seconds). One would think they would have fixed that by this time."

"389587","Sony Xperia M C1904 - Single SIM- Unlocked - US Warranty - (Black)",4,"It's good phone if you're not expecting too much.I won't speak about processors and stuff, here are lots of webs you can go and see that. I will only write about my experience as a customer.The phone was for my mom because she was stuck in an old BlackBerry since 2010. She already had a Samsung tablet so she was familiar with Android and she decided not to buy an expensive phone, just a durable, fast, up-to-date phone, just for checking Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, playing casual games like Candy Crush and taking pictures.So here are the pros and cons:Pros:• It's a very beautiful phone, specially the white one. It doesn't look cheap even though it has a plastic unibody and it's comfortable to handle.• I am really amazed how fast it is this phone: in every application, even with lots of tabs opened in Chrome (a strong RAM-consuming app)• The screen is good: responsive, colorful and crispy.• Loudspeaker is loud.• It is affordable.Cons:• This is the only con I found, anyway, it's a heavy one, specially if your a social-media enthusiast or a selfie freak: the camera is not good. Yes, the rear facing camera of 5 MP totally fails. When there's little to no sunlight (indoors, night, artificial lightning), the pictures are filled with noise and blur. Awful. And, let's not talk about the front facing VGA camera. There's no way that camera can take any good photo. My mom who is used to take hundreds of photos at reunions, parties, trips and upload them to Facebook or Instagram is disappointed with that.From here you can come to conclusions.My mom is happy with her fast and pretty phone but she's disappointed because of the camera problems... I really would've liked it had had a better camera."

I'm a civil engineer and i spend whole day outdoors and i have to be all the time trying to protect it from the head.. but I'm from Venezuela, so maybe somewhere else you might don't have this problem.The other thing that I don't like about it, is that i haven't found the way to move the apps from the cell phone to the SD card."

"389628","Sony Xperia M C1904 - Single SIM- Unlocked - US Warranty - (Black)",4,"I had the option to buy the Z model from my current phone company but it was closer to $600. In comparison to that model, by going with this one I missed out on a few options but not major ones. It has a front-facing camera and does everything else I need it to without being bulky. The regular camera seems to be lower megapixels than I'm used to but the phone's photo editing options pretty much make up for it. I love the ease of customizing screens and notifications. I had to get a micro SIM card to fit in the phone so it delayed me using it until I could get to my phone company's store but the card was free so it wasn't a major setback. The Xperia app that downloads once you connect the phone to a computer allows for a lot of options, including transferring contacts from your old phone so I did not lose anything. The battery life is a little shorter than I would prefer but there are battery-saving options that are pretty effective. I would definitely recommend this phone as a cheaper alternative to upgrading through a phone company!"

"389630","Sony Xperia M C1904 - Single SIM- Unlocked - US Warranty - (Black)",5,"This is an amazing phone for the price. It has the look performance & feel of a $500 phone for only $200. Probably the only concern is the small internal memory but you can put in a microsd & root it (both android & sony are open source so its completely easy) & then you can install apps on the memory to preserve the internal memory. I also liked that it came with almost no bloatware for me to remove. My only concern is its featherlight feels like nothing is in my hand(or pocket when not holding it) so I'll be sure to get a case for when I inevitably drop it."

Only small issue I have with the phone is that you can't move apps to SD card without rooting, but with 2gb for App storage that's really not a problem for me. Phone is FAST and truly customizable to the user."
"389646","Sony Xperia M C1904 - Single SIM- Unlocked - US Warranty - (Black)",4,"I purchased this phone to replace my Xperia X8, which had become painfully inadequate for today's apps. My new Xperia M actually cost less than what I paid three years ago for my X8, and is a vastly superior product in almost every respect. It came pre-loaded with Android 4.3, by the way.When I received this phone, it had an issue with the Google Play store. I could connect (via wi-fi) and select apps to download, but it could not download them (I got an error message). Rebooting the phone did not solve the problem. I quickly ""googled"" this issue, and found the solution on a user forum. I had to connect the phone to my PC, install the Sony PC Companion software, and use the ""repair my phone"" function. It took about 15 minutes to download and install the phone software, after which everything has been working perfectly. Not a huge deal for an experienced user, but it could be a deal breaker for the less experienced.I really enjoy the new OS and how fast and responsive this phone is. It looks very nice and is very well built, although the plastic and glass used are really thin, and therefore I think it must be handled with care. In terms of size, it has basically the same length and thickness as an iPhone 5, is about 1 mm wider, and weighs the same (actually, 0.6 grams more!).As other owners wrote, the available internal memory is limited (2.05 GB), but it is adequate for my needs. I can always add/delete apps whenever needed.I added a 32GB micro SD card to store media and data files. Beware that without rooting the phone (which I do not intend to do) apps can only be installed in the phone's internal memory.Overall I am very satisfied with this purchase and I recommend this product, although with the reserve I explained about the Google Play store issue."
"389647","Sony Xperia M C1904 - Single SIM- Unlocked - US Warranty - (Black)",5,"I have been looking for a phone to use when I go overseas and this one works perfectly. I've traveled all over Asia with it and it never skips a beat. Not a huge fan of the purple, but I leave it with my daughter when I come back to the States and she loves purple. The touchscreen works well, especially for a guy like me with big fingers. Some phones I fond cumbersome to use, but this one was great."
"389648","Sony Xperia M C1904 - Single SIM- Unlocked - US Warranty - (Black)",4,"Not only lots cheaper than an Iphone or unlocked Galaxy s5, but cheaper than an Ipod Touch!I'm not a heavy cell phone user, but I found that while traveling I wanted more functionality than my old flip phone offered, so I bought the Xperia M as a ""starter"" smart phone.My needs were really more for a highly-portable tablet computer than for a cellphone, and I think that the Xperia M will serve well in that role. I do have simple voice/text service on it--I migrated a prepaid T-Mobile account to it, which required only moving the account from the old, standard-size SIM to a micro card (the local T-Mobile store did it for free)--and I look forward to using it in Europe with a prepaid SIM to be acquired when I get there--a key feature of this phone for me was its multi-band capability. I was looking for a device that could be a more sophisticated MP3 player than the one I have, that could take decent pictures, be a GPS, and provide wifi connectivity on the go--basically, an Ipod touch with better value and that I could use for occasional phone calls--and this phone does all that. FM radio is a nice bonus, and seems to work fine. I don't watch movies or TV on little devices like this so I won't comment on that functionality.Hardware Notes:responsivebuild quality gooduses standard micro USB cablesharp readable screen, bright enough to view outdoorscontrols good, especially camerareally compact and lightmedia storage works fine with a not-super-fast SD card (one I had lying around)(app installation on the old SD card wasn't tested)battery life not really tested thus farSoftware Notes:Android version is stable so far--no hangs to datenot too badly cluttered up with pre-installed apps, but some stuff I don't want isn't deletablepretty simple interface and options navigationgood utilities, including power management optionsneeds a good way to back up to a Mac--that function in Mac bridge doesn't work (along with several other functions--be prepared to improvise to get Mac data onto the phone, unless you already use the Google cloud for all your personal information)The Sony mac bridge software (I can't comment on the Windows version) is not very good--get Android File Transfer. Music, pictures, and videos are easy to move to/from the phone even using the Sony utilities (although the Mac bridge is slow), but it's a little tricky to move e-books to the phone. It's probably easier for ITunes users, but I am not an ITunes fan. Since my e-books are all loaded into the Calibre e-book manager on my Mac, I finally ended up using Calibre's ability to act as a server (hint: turn off your Mac firewall), which worked, but is a little complicated. There's also a (not free) client utility available that is supposed to interface with the Calibre library that might be simpler than the Calibre server option. Again, if you read Google or ITunes books you won't have as many hoops to jump through. I was surprised to find that reading a book on such a small screen is not terrible.I have used the Office Suite only for reading pdfs so far, but it's nice to know that it's there just in case I need to read a Word doc or something.I'm still shopping for GPS software that will do a decent job without a data connection, so I can navigate without a cell phone data connection without depending on saved maps. I've done some simple tests for walking navigation using MyTracks and found that GPS-only performance was good, so I'm hopeful that more complex navigation is also possible.Since these phones are more popular in Asia than the US, model-specific accessories (e.g. cases) aren't as common as for more popular models, but the good news is that Asian accessories are cheap, if a little bit slow to acquire: I ordered some cases through Amazon that were scheduled to take 4-6 weeks to arrive, but I actually received them much more quickly.Probably not the phone for serious cell phone connoisseurs, but a capable bargain for less phone-centric buyers.Update June 28:After spending more time with the phone I have found one glitch: It is directionally impaired. The compass in Google Maps sometimes works and sometimes doesn't, and after trying several different compass apps I haven't found one that works consistently, regardless of calibration efforts. Online research suggests that this is a typical issue with XPerias, and probably hardware related--no one seems to have a sure fix. Google Maps and My Tracks still proved useful during a recent trip abroad, but directional indications need to be taken with a grain of salt.Battery life is modest: Fine for my usage (1-2 days), but perhaps a bit short for users who are more phone-centric. Charge time is really fast, though--much quicker than an IPad.If you're buying the phone for traveling abroad, consider the dual SIM version. Swapping SIMs is a little fumbly, and storing the US SIM in the phone would be safe and easy."

"389704","Sony Xperia M C1904 - Single SIM- Unlocked - US Warranty - (Black)",1,"i have a problem with this cellphone. you can use headphone with him. when you plug your headphone you can ear nothing. other problem: both camera are a disaste.the wors mistake is that i can't do a request i just time because the person who receives told me so late abou this trouble. you need to be carefull to check yuor products when you received inmediately.watch out at time and don'be surprised latereste celular lo encargó un cmpañero y yo se lo compré pero el detalle por el cual no pude hacer una reclamacion de los problemas que trajo este equipo fue porque me vaiso depsues de los 30 dias y ya estaba cerrado para hacer reclamaciones o devoluciones. por reso lo califico mal"
"389705","Sony Xperia M C1904 - Single SIM- Unlocked - US Warranty - (Black)",4,"I got this phone for my girlfriend because her other Xperia smartphone died on her after 2 years use. We needed a cheap option and it seemed like a good choice for the price. Overall it's a great phone, little to no slowdown when using several apps, great battery life, NFC, good size for one hand use, decent camera and nice build quality and design.The only downside is the screen. Colors are a bit washed out so everything has a paleish blue hue. It really is a shame because it's a very good phone for every day use and it performs better than what I expected. With a better screen, I would easily give it 5 stars."
"389706","Sony Xperia M C1904 - Single SIM- Unlocked - US Warranty - (Black)",4,"It works great. It has a large selection of apps. I get two days of use between charges. I wish the screen was in HD."
"389707","Sony Xperia M C1904 - Single SIM- Unlocked - US Warranty - (Black)",5,"This phone was a nice surprise. It is fast and full featured. Sure it doesn't have premiumscreen and the sturdy metal frame but these weren't things I was looking for. This phoneis very responsive. It has GPS, Bluetooth, Wifi..... Pretty much everything. If you needbasic phone that does it all look no further. Another surprising thing is how light thisphone is which you don't get with metal frame. The other real good feature is the sizeof the screen. It is compact and I don't have the feeling I am talking into a tablet."
"389708","Sony Xperia M C1904 - Single SIM- Unlocked - US Warranty - (Black)",4,"This phone is a great buy for the price. One of the only down falls is the with the camera there is a blue hue, when viewed on the phone's display. If the picture is sent via email to someone else, there is no blue hue."
"389709","Sony Xperia M C1904 - Single SIM- Unlocked - US Warranty - (Black)",1,"On the 16/02/2014,an a nice Sunday evening chilling and using my new phone and all of a sudden it froze up. the touch shop working. i then remove the battery and chip but i still it doesn't respond. so i take it to an technician the next day.i then get to know dat the digitizer stop working. come on! how can a brand new phone digitizer stop working,its never being squeeze r drop.tell me this, there i was downloading a game off of play store and it just froze. can u please explain this to me. now i got the feeling dat i brought a new phone but i was deceive and was giving a old one or refurbish. now i have to go and spend more money to get a digitizer, come on people.why?."
"389710","Sony Xperia M C1904 - Single SIM- Unlocked - US Warranty - (Black)",3,"Ok this is a ""nice"" phone.Basic, simple to use, and user friendly.It is just too darn small for my hands. Unfortunately, once you open the box Amazon will not take it back. I had it activated and tried it for three days.The screen is only 4 inches. I'd go for the Xperia Z1 folks."
"389711","Sony Xperia M C1904 - Single SIM- Unlocked - US Warranty - (Black)",1,"Had not included headphones or headset, which also brought a Samsung charger, I thought it was not going to have problems with this purchase"
"389712","Sony Xperia M C1904 - Single SIM- Unlocked - US Warranty - (Black)",3,"This phone does its job decently enough, but the fact that I bought a 32 GB memory card for it and I can't use it to save apps really puts it down a few pegs. I can use it for music (not for the Walkman app that comes pre-loaded) and for other apps that keep data aside from their executables. Other than that it's a fine cheap phone that works for me just fine over in New Zealand. I've had it for about two months now and it's holding up in all other capacities."
"389713","Sony Xperia M C1904 - Single SIM- Unlocked - US Warranty - (Black)",5,"beautiful"
"389714","Sony Xperia M C1904 - Single SIM- Unlocked - US Warranty - (Black)",4,"This is a great phone. For how much it's selling for right now, if you need a cost effective, functional smartphone that also looks good (great for the price range) this is a good choice. Also, when reading pro reviews, a lot of reviewers complained about the screen quality. For the life of me I can't figure out why. It looks great It's a 4 inch smartphone, you really don't need 1080P and all that.Pros:- Classy look, seems to be well constructed- Sony IMHO, has the best UI out of any android company- Solid battery life, processor and RAM good enough for most apps/games/tasks- Screen is large enough to do most things on, but phone is small enough to easily fit in hand and pocketCons:- Limited internal storage space and no way to move apps to SD card. Essentially, you have to hack the phone and install your own memory card.- Sony likely won't upgrade to Android Kitkat, even though most other phone companies are upgrading their older phones.These two cons mentioned are why I gave the phone a 4 star rating. If Sony does upgrade to Kitkat (which allows you to send apps to the memory card) I would have no problem giving this a 5 star rating."

"389727","Sony Xperia M C1904 - Single SIM- Unlocked - US Warranty - (Black)",3,"I'll start with the problems that the user has encountered so far. We encountered a problem with connecting to our carrier's internet. I suspect that it has to do with how the phone tries to conserve energy because after awhile, I was able to connect even though we haven't moved from our location. The biggest problem we've encountered was the phone's inability to transfer app data from the phone's internal storage to a SD card. This will prove a limiting factor despite purchasing additional storage. The internal storage is very limited in storage space. The case is soft (relatively) and easily damaged.It does have all the functions smart phone has that I have seen (except for the app to SD card). It's a budget phone, if you're heavy user of apps, I would highly discourage you from it. Otherwise, it's an okay buy."

"389733","Sony Xperia M C1904 - Single SIM- Unlocked - US Warranty - (Black)",1,"Where do I start.....I guess most of the reviews on this phone where wrote just after the phone was received, because this is not a good phone. I bought this phone two months ago and the problems I got so far are: (1)Phone drain off the battery so quick that it needs to be permanently charged; (2)the cellphone keep turning off by itself; (3)the power stamina option keep disable my data and popping up a message that says: Additional charges may apply; (4)car charger does not work; (5)crash consistently while surfing; (6)wants to download useless application from SONY when it cannot even manage the simple ones installed; and (7) constantly loss signal. This is a cheap phone and that is what you got a CHEAP PHONE..... so be ready because it is a headache. Do yourself a favor and buy a expensive one"

I got a cheap, stylish, solid and good quality built phone.Before I order it I was hesitant, because I read so many reviews that said it had a terrible screen but I have no complaints at all.I read somewhere that the Moto E had a better screen and I have one of those and I really can't see the much difference. I also compared this phone with the Xperia Z1 and it feels the same, obviously there I could see the difference but only when I downloaded a 4k demo image to compare both screens, beside that the screen looks almost the same for standard apps. I am a Sony fan and I don't feel like I need a phone screen to watch 4k movies, I have other divices to enjoy media like that.Overall I am really happy with this purchase and after this I trust even more in sony's quality for their electronics."

I got a cheap, stylish, solid and good quality built phone.Before I order it I was hesitant, because I read so many reviews that said it had a terrible screen but I have no complaints at all.I read somewhere that the Moto E had a better screen and I have one of those and I really can't see the much difference. I also compared this phone with the Xperia Z1 and it feels the same, obviously there I could see the difference but only when I downloaded a 4k demo image to compare both screens, beside that the screen looks almost the same for standard apps. I am a Sony fan and I don't feel like I need a phone screen to watch 4k movies, I have other divices to enjoy media like that.Overall I am really happy with this purchase and after this I trust even more in sony's quality for their electronics."

I travel extensively for work and not having to move different country sims in and out with the possibility of losing one was my objective. Subjectively I think the phone is attractive and the call quality was good. The main camera is very good as the front facing camera is just so so. It takes a micro sd card too."

"389954","Sony Xperia M4 Aqua 16GB GSM/LTE Unlocked Cell Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",1,"We've had this phone for 3 months or so, and it just decided to completely quit working. In the middle of the day, it shut off and now refuses to turn back on (the battery was at 60%).Aside from the fact that it no longer works, we were having trouble with various aspects of the phone. It would constantly switch networks in the middle of calls and then hang up on the person you're talking to. Additionally, the battery life *might* be good for 12 hours, and the GPS does not work---it updates two or three miles after you've missed the turn."
"389955","Sony Xperia M4 Aqua 16GB GSM/LTE Unlocked Cell Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",1,"Update: the phone has been under repair by sony for 6 weeks, ""waiting for parts"" with no information on when it will be sent back. That makes nearly 3 months of repair time in 7 months of ownership. This phone has gone back twice, and my daughter's Z3 Compact has gone back once for the side charge port coming off, and been fixed a second time by me for the same issue, along with a new back, which spontaneously shattered while sitting on a car seat about 1 week after the warranty expired.Well, I bought this phone for $200. But it is really a $400 phone since you have to buy 2 of them. One to use, and one to send back for repair. Actually a fine phone when it works. First phone had the screen fail after a few months, now replacement has the microphone and earpiece fail a few month later. A smart phone kinda needs a screen and a microphone and speaker. Like I say, just buy 2."
"389956","Sony Xperia M4 Aqua 16GB GSM/LTE Unlocked Cell Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",2,"Not the best quality. Doesn't really protect the cell phone, just by scratches."
"389957","Sony Xperia M4 Aqua 16GB GSM/LTE Unlocked Cell Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",1,"I have had overheating and shut off issues ever since I purchased this phone, but I sucked it up. In December a software update prevented the phone from restarting continually when it overheated. However, it still, overheated. In March the phone died. It Refused to charge it just gave up the ghost. I sent it to Sony for repair and one month later still no phone. It is impossible to speak with anyone at the repair center and the customer service is equally hopeless. My advice is to keep your money. If you are ever unfortunate enough to need a repair you will be on your own."
"389958","Sony Xperia M4 Aqua 16GB GSM/LTE Unlocked Cell Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",1,"Here is why. It arrived, I charged it, got it to the store and activated my sim for it with my plan, the problem with this phone is it constantly restarts. I've tried several things and no luck. Every time it updates an app or downloads something, it restarts. Your in the middle of doing something, it freezes for about 5 seconds... then restarts. It sits there and I'm not even using it, you guessed it, restarts. Also it gets hot, even after 1 minute of use. That is very irregular. I finally gave up after the third time it went unresponsive and black screen. Last night it ""stayed on"" somehow with a black screen and overheated. The battery was depleted when I woke and it was very hot. DO NOT GET THIS PHONE."
"389959","Sony Xperia M4 Aqua 16GB GSM/LTE Unlocked Cell Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",5,"So I've always been bad lucky with Blackberry and Blu. My first time owning a Sony Phone. Was super amazed that it was water proof. Threw it in water last night for couple minutes and its still up and running. Can't go wrong with this phone. Its cheap plus have amazing specs. My only wish is that I got the dual SIM version."

"389963","Sony Xperia M4 Aqua 16GB GSM/LTE Unlocked Cell Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",1,"Worst cell phone ever, not reliable. It just heat itself and turn it off for several hours until the battery is drained. Not recommended at all, returning it to amazon."
"389964","Sony Xperia M4 Aqua 16GB GSM/LTE Unlocked Cell Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",1,"I am writing to you to report the problem has been happening with my Smartphone Sony Xperia M4 Aqua , which since last January I have given use, it turns out that the problem started slightly from about 2 months turned off and lit , passing day the fault was increasing as the image on the screen froze , then think of a distortion of colors and shapes, he turned it off and had to resort to forced restart.The phone will have been two factory reset , and does not have different applications bringing (except for Whatsapp ) and currently does not work, start logo Xperia then Android , distortion of colors and shapes occurs on the screen and is off and so is every cycle ."
"389965","Sony Xperia M4 Aqua 16GB GSM/LTE Unlocked Cell Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",1,"I received the cellphone in January 2016 because im from Venezuela. Its was a gift for my girlfriend and the last month was her birthday. The cellphone does not charge, the green led is off even when the charger is conected. I tried with differents chargers, computer conection, differents cables, press the reset button for 15 seg 30 seg 1 min 5 min. Press the vol+ and power button, vol- and power buttom, press the power buttom for 5 min, all kind o recommendations from sony.com and nothing. The cellphone does not start. I want to know what i can do about it. Thank you for your time."

"389967","Sony Xperia M4 Aqua 16GB GSM/LTE Unlocked Cell Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",2,"*Update after 5 months*Loud speakers blew out.I'm pretty sure it's from being caught in heavy rain a couple weeks ago.Buy this POS at your own risk.It's cheaper right now so it could be worth the money.I've had this phone for a couple months now. I really haven't had a problem with it. The screen can get pretty warm at times but it hasn't overheated. The camera is really nice just not great in horrible lighting and the battery life can drain pretty quickly depending on the activity, but that's fine lol my only real gripe is that there aren't any good (protective) cases for it."
"389968","Sony Xperia M4 Aqua 16GB GSM/LTE Unlocked Cell Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",1,"The phone itself is not bad, but the customer service from Sony is awful. After a few months of using the phone, the ear piece in the phone stopped working, I called sony and explained the problem, it still worked on speaker, and with the handsfree set in, but not when holding the earpiece to my ear. They insisted it could be a software glitch and had me reset the phone..... twice, which did not work.So I had to send it in for repair, and this is where the fun starts. Having been told it would take about 14 business days to fix and send my phone back, I am currently still waiting and we are on business day 28. To this point, after 4 phone calls, and 3 emails (because one representative actually told me that they didn't have a way to call people at the facility where the repairs take place, true story!), still no-one can tell me when the phone might be fixed.With that in mind, I asked for a replacement phone the last time I contacted them, I felt that was not unreasonable as they were well past their own schedule for repairing and returning my device, and clearly could not give any clue as to when it might be done. They simply ignored that request and said that my phone would be repaired and sent back when they got the parts in. This could be in 6 days, or 6 months.I would not by this product and would recommend people avoid sony products if this is what happens when the slightest thing goes wrong. The support (or lack thereof) is appalling for a company of their size and standing, and it could be a simple fix, if they would just replace a device when they are having so much trouble finding the part they need for it. Instead they are leaving a paying customer hanging, with no recourse, and without the phone paid for."

Would have given 4+ if not for the sluggish and heat factor. Best suitable for an early teen with minimal usage (and as expected gaming usage)."

But as many reviews said it has heating problem, On start when all applications starts- Mobile gets heated very quickly. But Good part is over the time in a minute or 2 it gets cool down.Heating problem is probably because of its Water proof feature. Since all body is air tight, very space for air ventilation inside."
"389983","Sony Xperia M4 Aqua 16GB GSM/LTE Unlocked Cell Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",5,"I've been a Sony user my whole life and I'm usually pretty pleased with them. Sony phones are super user friendly and I usually just like the overall quality of their phones, but this phone is a game changer! I feel like this is the most luxurious phone I've ever held! I take lots of pictures so the first thing I played with was the camera, and I started to get worried because I read reviews it wasn't that great, but I think its wonderful. It does very well in low light and it seems to fit more into the picture, it also has cute editing settings for those who like to play with pics. It set up very quickly and I was able to update and download all my old apps that I liked in a reasonable amount of time. I heard phone calls were quiet but I made a few phone calls and played with ringtones and they seemed loud enough to me, the dimmest brightness setting is still very bright, and I was able to send and receive mms very quickly which is something I've found to be on the slower side with Sony phones. I have yet to test just how waterproof the phone is but based on videos and other reviews I've read I'm betting it'll hold up through anything I could/would ever put it through. The phone took just under 2 hours to fully charge and it actually does last 2 days! I put it through at least 12 hours of internet streaming and made phone calls and texts before needing to charge it again at the end of the second day, also I had like 12 apps running at once before I decided to close them all and you'd never even know all those apps were running it was so fast! I definitely recommend this phone to anyone looking into it."

I am new to android but I ordered a LG G3 for my wife after i ordered this for myself. Gotta say the LG G3 is WAY BETTER than this and also is 32 GB for $20 more!Sony really failed with their Phone interface on this phone, even though it s a smart phone most people still use it to MAKE CALLS, please keeep that in mind SONY and make sure you have a user friendly phone interface on all your phones."

"389992","Sony Xperia M4 Aqua 16GB GSM/LTE Unlocked Cell Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",5,"Only had the phone a day so keep that in mind when reading this review....My last phone was the Nexus 4. I had it just under 3 years. Great phone. Its lack of LTE bands and limited space (16GB with no SD card) was a problem. Other than that I'd still have the phone. I have no interest in paying the premium for a flagship phone as midrange phones are plenty for my needs. I tried a couple different refurbished phones but each on had problems...I assume because they were used/refurbished. So I knew I had to go with a new phone. I did get the invite for the OnePlus X but canceled my order when I decided that it lack too many LTE bands to be as useful as it could be in the US (really band 4 was the only option). I was thinking about getting a Z3 but even used ones were still way too expensive IMO. So I saw this one.I knew when I ordered it that it was not a flagship phone. It has a 13megapixal camera which is not flagship quality but...its not a flagship. The battery is only 2400+ which is low compared to flagship but...its not a flagship phone. CPU...not flagship quality but... you know.Its not a flagship phone but it is also 1/3 the price of a flagship phone. It offers all the gsm LTE bands you could want (for the US). Its thin. The battery isn't 2 days as Sony says but in the 1 day I've had it I've been impressed (Nexus 4 was smaller battery so this better). Camera is only 13megapixal but its better than the 8megapixal I was use to. Its practically stock android (something I am use to).On a personal note: I like the design of the phone. I never liked the rounded back you get on many phones now a days. I like when my lays on a table that it doesn't rock when you click on the screen. I like the relatively squared corners of the M4. It gives the illusion of a good phone to screen size ratio. I completely understand others might not share these opinions. Its just my preference.For the money its a good phone. For now I'll give it 5 stars as my limited experience has been nothing but great.While I appreciate what flagship phones give you (my Nexus 4 was a flagship phone in its time) and I could afford it if I wanted but what you get for the cost just doesn't out weigh a number of mid-range phones priced in the $~200 range.Edit #1 (1 week):Absolutely no complaints. Its a beautiful phone..especially in its price range. The battery has been absolutely fantastic for my use. I am confident I could get almost 2 days on my normal use. My more significant use (when my son gets his hands on it) does drain the battery faster but I can still get over a day with it. This is the first phone I've had where I know I do not have to plug it in during the day and can probably skip charging every night.Edit #2 (2 months):Fantastic phone. For the money I am shocked how good it is. It is only running Lollipop but I can only assume that the Sony customization to the OS has added something to improve battery life (like what Marshmallow gives you today). When I am at work I probably listen to music (from the SD card) for about 4-5 hours a day. Add in a little internet usage throughout the day and I still have ~60% battery life by the end of the day. As I said before when pushed the phone can drain quickly (son playing lots of games or watching YouTube videos) but for my normal usage this is quite nice for me. My Nexus 4 would not make to the end of my work day without needing to be plugged in if I did the same thing (music and some internet browsing).The camera is? Well the camera itself is quite nice. But the Sony camera software isn't quite right. Its slow. The Android camera app is a definite improvement. So I am not going to change my 5 star review for a slow camera app (that would be silly).I did find one problem though: I had paired my phone with my car (Honda Fit). Everything was working fine for days/weeks. Then one day I realized the car was not informing me of text messages from my phone. Seems the phone had some sort of issue with bluetooth and its saved pairing with the car seemed broken. I had to delete the pairing my phone and car had and recreate the pairing. Its been fine since then. Not sure what happened or what caused the issue but all seems fine now. I suppose if I could do 4.5 stars I'd consider lowering my review but since I cannot I am sticking with 5 as I think it is better that 4 stars. Plus....its possible my car was the problem and not the phone (but I did not have this problem with my previous phone).Anyways....love the phone."
"389993","Sony Xperia M4 Aqua 16GB GSM/LTE Unlocked Cell Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",5,"Great phone. Used it for about a month and have no problems. Battery lasts all day even with high usage. Only have 1 app that won't work because the company only has it available for IPhone or Samsung. Just had to get a different SIM card from my service provider to get started."
"389994","Sony Xperia M4 Aqua 16GB GSM/LTE Unlocked Cell Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",1,"Nice looking phone, but Sony sucks. Their quality control is completely ridiculous and constantly send out defective phones. The mic will work 2/5 times on this phone even while doing the diagnostic test."
"389995","Sony Xperia M4 Aqua 16GB GSM/LTE Unlocked Cell Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",4,"I got this phone to replace a broken LG G4 and I have to say it's a decent mid-range phone.Pros: Waterproof Sleek design Decent headset audio and speaker volumeOverall decent performance. Excellent battery life with stamina mode on, even with LTE. I got nearly four hours screen on time.2GB RAM is enough for multitasking.Seamlessly transitions from LTE to 3G to 2G depending on coverage area. Downloads are super quick on LTE (Panama's 10x10Mhz 700Mhz Band 28 LTE went as fast as 50mbps/20mbps dl/ul) Micro SD card support up to 128GB.Bootloader can be officially unlocked and there is a small custom ROM community on xdaCons: Can get laggy with games. Display is not as good as the Z3 seriesCamera quality is so-soGets a bit hot with extended use though it cools quickly.No double tap to wake like on the Z3 series.Comes with useless bloatware installed,luckily some of it can be eliminated.Overall. I'm happy with it for now."
"389996","Sony Xperia M4 Aqua 16GB GSM/LTE Unlocked Cell Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",5,"As always Sony is ahead of the pack of phones I have ever owned. I had several Sony's in a row and due to budget and carrier restraints I had a Windows phone for 6 months. Well I am back and while it is not the newest and best Sony offers it is by far more amazing than other phones I have tried from friends and relatives.The specs may be lower but it is to be expected from a mid-range phone after all. Honestly for me it is on par with the high range phones I had previously from Sony's Xperia line.If you are tired of waiting for the latest and greatest from one particular company who shall remain nameless, BUY A SONY AND GET MANY OF THOSE FUNCTIONS NOW RATHER THAN WAIT 1-3 YEARS FOR THEM TO CATCH UP.Yes, there is a heating issue with the phone, but logic just tells you if it is heating up too much it is time to put the phone down and get back to life.As for apps all my old favorites load perfectly well and several I was waiting to try are beyond amazing on this phone. Something I definitely could not say for my few apps on my Lumia phone prior to this.Essentially if you are looking for an amazing phone that will provide you with all the features and apps you need and have become used to having on Android, pick up this phone and support SONY as they have truly innovative products on the market.The SONY XPERIA line of phones is definitely worth the money and buying UNLOCKED from Amazon mean no excess carrier bloatware that slows the phone and makes any amazing phone seem to be a letdown."
"389997","Sony Xperia M4 Aqua 16GB GSM/LTE Unlocked Cell Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",4,"I have had the phone for a couple of weeks. Got it on a pre-black Friday sale for $199. For the price-point, it is a pretty good phone. The processor is pretty quick and it has 16GB memory with the capability of adding a microSD to expand an additional 128GB. I have a 32GB card in mine. It can free up space by transferring apps and files to the microSD with a touch of a button. That is a nice feature that my LG did not have. It also has the auto-screen brightness adjustment which isn't always offered in phones at this price-point. I have had a bit of a learning curve switching to Sony from LG, but it hasn't been too bad. My apps didn't all load automatically when I logged on with my Google account, which was a bit of a pain. (And one app was no longer available, so I lost that one entirely.) I haven't tried the headphones, but the Bluetooth works fine with my car stereo. The camera has all kinds of special features that I will most likely never use (like adding an animated dinosaur to your pictures). It seems like a pretty decent camera so far. Calling and texting work well. I did have to manually enter my APN settings for Net10, but that was simple enough. My daughter ended up getting one of these phones as well."

Figured I'd just buy a new phone. Didn't want to buy a current gen for $700 so I figured this next-up gen would be better. All I really want in a phone was that it was water proof(resistant now) and had a good battery. The z3 fit that bill easily so I thought the m4 would too. Everything about this m4 is less responsive than the z3. Touchscreen feels different/less responsive and apps loading/switching is less responsive. But hey, for the price it's not bad and it definitely fits what I'm looking for. Battery lasts forever on moderate usage and dunking it isn't a problem.

I disabled the secondary mic that is for noise suppression and now the main mic seems to be working on calls but the quality is poor. This is a disappointment for a phone with ""aqua"" in the name. The battery life is terrible. It often lasts less than 12 hours. Sony customer support was worthless as usual. Now I have to send it in and be without a phone for 2 weeks.

"390044","Sony Xperia M4 Aqua 16GB GSM/LTE Unlocked Cell Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",3,"I purchased this phone when the price first dropped to $200 on Black Friday. I figured this would be an upgrade to my damaged Nexus 4, rather than repairing it. The great part of this phone is that it had more RAM, drive space and a seemingly faster processor. Plus that fact that I could add an SD card and was waterproof was a bonus.Upon use I immediately noticed that the octa-core processor would heat up the phone very easily, to the point that it would be hot to touch. I use this for everything, from setting appointments, sharing files across apps, playing Candy Crush, running with RunKeeper and playing music, using Waze/Google Maps and posting on Facebook. It acts fine with using one app at a time, but crashes, overheats and slows down completely when multitasking. This is VERY frustrating when I'm trying to make a call or quickly set up directions for navigation.On the plus side, I am happy that it is waterproof. I went running last month, and during the last quarter-mile, I got stuck in a rain storm. Did not affect the device at all.Beside the fact that it has more storage that is also expandable, my Nexus 4 with less cores and less memory easily out-performs this phone. Hopefully the Z-series of this phone is much faster, else I may have to get the more expensive Samsung S series phones to solve my frustrations."
"390045","Sony Xperia M4 Aqua 16GB GSM/LTE Unlocked Cell Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",5,"I bought this phone in Aug of 2015 and I still love it. It has everything that I need and want with a phone. It takes decent photos, and is just the right size for me. I did almost run out of space on it once but the problem was easily resolved by uploading all of my pictures to google drive and then deleting them from my phone. As mentioned by some other reviewers it does heat up sometimes but this is rare and has never been a real problem. The battery life is good, for me itusually last a couple days unless I am constantly using my phone. I did take some pictures with it while standing in a creek where the phone was exposed to some water, not completely immersed, and it was fine. The phone looks really nice and sleek and like I said is the perfect size for me I am 5'4"" and I don't like the huge phones. At the same time the screen seems really big when I am watching something on the phone. I have had the phone almost a year and have had no hardware or software problems. I am so happy I found and bought this cell phone it has definitely met and exceeded my expectations and I only paid a little over 200 dollars for it. I will probably replace it when it is really outdated but it will be hard to part with! I definitely recommend this phone if you are an android person."

Its not a bad phone for 200 bucks but the more I use it the more I wish I just lived without a phone for a bit longer and bought something better."

He likes the phone... and I didn't have to spend three or four times as much on a phone. T-Mobile sim bought with it was perfect, too."
"390051","Sony Xperia M4 Aqua 16GB GSM/LTE Unlocked Cell Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",4,"Pros+Good Looking Design+Good Performance+Waterproof+MicroSD Expansion+Good Camera+Android Pay CompatibleCons-Okay Screen-Average Speaker-Average Battery Life-Decent Performance-Not the only good phone availableShould you buy: YESActual Value $200Sony has made a lot of great, if a bit too frequent, phones. With a waterproof design and glass construction, it has a great record of making phones. However, those phones had competition from Samsung, LG, among others that made it difficult to stand out. Sony, however, has decided to aim for the midrange market by making this: the Xperia M4 Aqua. In 2014, I would’ve recommended this phone instantly. However, in 2016, is it still a good buy among the rest of the excellent lineup of 2015? That is what I tried to find. In short, it is a good phone. But that leaves me conflicted as to where to place this phone in the current state of the market.-Design-Any similarities with any of the phones in the Xperia lineup is no coincidence. In fact, that is kind of its selling point; it doesn’t look like other phones in this price range. The glass found on the front and back is beautiful and feels premium in the hand and from any distance it looks like a much pricier phone. The Sony and Xperia label add a bit of class to this otherwise good looking budget phone. This also makes it a bit disappointing to find a plastic frame instead of a metal one that is found on its older brother. But considering its price, this is something that can be forgiven. In the hand, it feels light enough to easily carry but dense enough to feel like it won’t break easily. That being said, I recommend buying a case immediately in order to prevent any part of the glass from shattering. The front grills on the phone are nice, but they are a bit deceiving. The speaker, unlike the other Xperia, is actually on the bottom of the phone. The top one is an earpiece for calling and the bottom one is a microphone. There is also your typical power and volume rocker, along with a two-stage button. This last button that should be in all phones and I’m surprised that it is a rare thing to find these days. Overall, it is a good looking phone that should make most people happy.-Performance-The specs on this phone are good for the price. It is packing a Snapdragon 615 with 2GB of RAM, 720p display, Android Lollipop, and microSD card expansion. In benchmarks, the phone runs just above the Alcatel Idol 3 (4.7) but a great distance under the Samsung Galaxy S5. It is a respectable score for the price. However, it is a bit confusing in general use. It is snappy most of the time with general day to day task. But sometimes the bloatware that Sony adds to the phone makes it stutter a bit, particularly when multitasking a lot of apps. It never slows down completely or enough to get in the way, but it is noticeable. Most games, or any other graphic demanding app, do run well on this device without an issue with only the heaviest of games stuttering a bit. Apps also run smooth while they are open and even when going back to it while multitasking. In my practical testing, I can open up to 5 apps without any of them closing, including Chrome, Snapchat, YouTube, Amazon app, and Instagram. Signal quality, for the most part, is good. There are a few areas in my area of Los Angeles where I get a weaker signal than what I’ve experienced with OnePlus and Alcatel, but they are minor issues. My top speed running on the T-Mobile network was 54 Mbps download speed and 7 Mbps upload. Call quality is also good from both ends of the call, with both earpiece and loudspeaker providing loud volume and above average quality. While it does have the hardware to use Band 12, it is unable to use it since it doesn’t meet the requirement from T-Mobile. But it still performs well and should be great for most people.-Display-The phone has a 1280 x 720 HD display with a pixel density of 294 ppi. While on paper that does look like a lower level of pixel density than other phones it’s actually good enough for most people, with text looking slightly fuzzy when holding the phone right up close. Colors are good, but not excellent. They are good enough, but next to something like the S5, OnePlus, or even the Alcatel Idol 3 the colors look a bit washed out. The white balance is slightly towards the blue side, but it isn’t that noticeable. Thankfully, Sony does allow for tweaking the display settings should you want to make it good. Contrast and brightness levels, on the other hand, are great and they do allow for it to be usable in direct sunlight. Only thing I have of concern is the glass on the display. I have not found a confirm report as to what the glass is (Gorilla Glass, Dragontrail); the only thing I have found it to be listed as is “scratch-resistant glass.” Just something to keep in mind. Overall it is a decent screen, but there are better options available.-Camera-Sony has a reputation for making quality camera sensors, such as the iPhone and other flagships, so I was expecting some of that tech to drop down to their midrange phone. The result is good, but not much more than that. It comes equipped with a back-facing 13MP camera and a front, wide angle 5 MP camera. I couldn’t find any specific information on the sensor in the back, with Sony limiting themselves to only saying it is a Sony Exmor RS model, but no specific requirement in particular. Since there is no other phone that we can identify with this sensor, we’ll have to judge it independently with other phones in this price category. So, is it good? In general, yes. Photos taken in bright light come out excellent and the phone does focus quick on the subject or background that is being exposed. Colors are a bit lighter than what they are in real life, but it’s not a deal breaker. Low light is surprisingly good for the price. Sure, it isn’t up to the level of an S6 or a G4, but it is above what most other phones can deliver. The phone does suffer from motion blur, so nighttime shots are best left for tripod or steady hands. In short, it is a decent camera perfect for social media.-Software-The Xperia M4 comes with Android Lollipop 5.0 with some extras that range from good to completely useless. The phone has a custom Sony skin that would look okay if the other apps that you had look similar. But their round shape and overall design contrast to all the other apps that you might download. In addition to this, there are also apps that I wish Sony would make downloadable if needed, but removable if not needed. Apps such as XPERIA Lounge and Playstation Video are useless for me since I don’t have a Playstation and other such as Sketch and AR effect are fun, but ultimately just gimmicks. There are also a few small apps that can be used while using another app, for example the browser, a timer, and a calculator. There are also some small apps that can be downloaded from the Play Store, but you still can’t use any apps. Everything else works similarly to stock Android, with performance being much better if there hadn’t added some annoying bloatware to the mix. The good news is that Sony promises an update to 6.0 Marshmallow for 2016, so that is a positive note. Sony did a good job, but I can’t help but wonder it if could’ve been better.-Waterproofing and Extra Notes-Now, on to this phone’s highlighted feature: the water resistance. Just a little bit of information that you should know: Sony never directly states that it is completely waterproof. They even advise against putting it completely underwater. Nevertheless, it is good on its promise of being water resistant. Placing it underwater for 20 minutes completely submerged didn’t harm it and listening to music in the shower worked great. I wouldn’t recommend doing it constantly, but it does give reassurance that water will not kill it. Something I do want to note is that this phone heats up rapidly even when just going through simple web browsing. Also, the battery does not give 2 days of battery life. The power saving modes do help with battery life, but the most I’ve gotten in general use is one day with 4 hours of screen on time. It is good, but nowhere near the 2 hours it claims.-Conclusion-Here is where I have trouble with this phone. Independently, it is a really good phone with good performance for what it is in addition to a beautiful design and waterproofing that gives users the confidence to have it in the rain. However, there is currently a lot of competition that makes it hard to recommend this phone. For starters, if you want the best bang for your buck, there is the Blu Life One X with a better screen and similar design for less money at $149. If you want a compact phone, there is the Alcatel Idol 3 4.7 at $179 which is still a good phone that is lighter. If you want the looks of the M4, what’s wrong with the OnePlus X, which has a much better screen, much more power, and looks almost the same at a slightly higher price of $249? Honestly, any of the above options are great and they are cheaper than the M4. If you really need the waterproofing, then this is one of your cheaper options and definitely the one to get. But for everyone else, the other options would probably be better."

I have used android tablets, so I have a general familiarity with them. I was impressed with this phone, which has a nice screen and everything functions quickly. I was also impressed with the versatility/configurability of android, as this was my first real time spent setting it up. For the money (I got it on a flash deal for $149) I don't think you can beat this device.UPDATE: 3/20/2016For those who've suffered heat or battery life issues, or the ""sleep of death"", I also had this problem, which is highly frustrating. However, these issues resolved for me by using the Sony PC companion software. You have to connect the phone to the computer and in the PC Companion, press start under Support Zone > Start under update phone software > repair phone. Then follow the on screen instructions in the program. Since I did this (a month ago) I've had no further problems and it's been a fantastic phone."

"390059","Sony Xperia M4 Aqua 16GB GSM/LTE Unlocked Cell Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",5,"I have an LG G3 in RMA. It just resets on its own. I needed a spare phone and was considering a BLU phone until I found this at 50% off the MSRP. This was a lucky impulse buy which I got at the right time.The phone was the E2306. This thing has T-Mobile's HSPA+ (3G) 1700 MHz frequency (not common) for unlocked phones. It also has LTE bands 2,4,5,12,17 which are the majority of T-Mobile and AT&T frequencies.The phone is pretty slick. I love the aesthetics. It feels dense though. I fear if I drop it, it will break.I had a Nexus 5 (32GB) and LG G3 (32GB) before this phone. So I will use them as references.First item to compare… the screen size and resolution. This phone has the smallest size of the 3 and the smallest resolution of 1280 x 720 (HD). Nexus 5 was a Full HD phone and the LG G3 is a Quad HD. I do not feel that I am missing anything with the lower resolution. How small do you need your text? Everything appears to be crystal clear.Next is the RAM… This has 2GB to match the Nexus 5, and 1GB less than the LG G3. I did not see this phone slow down. I have not been playing any games. I have not been using it at its fullest limit.Next is the storage… this phone has the smallest of the 3 phones with 16 GB. So, this will limit the number of apps you can use and install. I saw this limit on a Samsung tablet and I believe this is the greatest detractor. Now, this also has an MicroSD slot. This is something that the Nexus 5 does not have. So potentially, you can store more pictures and music in this device. The LG G3 wins hands down with 32GB internal with MicroSD card expansion slot. As a spare phone, this Xperia M4 is perfect for me. This could be my daily driver if my LG G3 cannot be repaired. (I no longer have the Nexus 5).NFC… all the phones have NFC, and Bluetooth, Wi-Fi wireless N also included.Battery… the battery is not user replaceable. This was the flaw with my Nexus 5 and why it needed to be replaced. The LG G3 wins this factor with a replaceable battery.Processor speed… This is the slowest on paper but it is future proofed with a 64-bit processor. Although it is an Octo (8) core, it is more like 2 quad cores switching between the two. I do not think I am missing the power. It is still as smooth as the other phones.Speaker… The Nexus 5 and this phone has roughly the same location. The LG G3 speaker is on the back. Of the 3 phones mentioned, this has the BEST SPEAKER phone volume and SPEAKER for music.Camera… This has a 13 MP camera. IT IS THE BEST CAMERA OF ALL 3 PHONES NOTED. I have not taken a blurry picture with this phone. It is slower than the LG G3 and about the same speed as the Nexus 5 in taking pictures, but it is worth it for the quality.Waterproof… need I say more. The LG G3 and the Nexus 5 are not. So, I can put this under the sink faucet and wash my phone. This is probably a major reason that the battery is not user replaceable.Other items to note:1. This phone uses a Nano-SIM. This is the smallest of the 3 phone SIM card form factors.2. The native messaging app stinks! Sony dropped the ball on how it handles group SMS/MMS and organizing the received messages on the group. Sony splits ALL the received messages and sending a group MMS requires a subject. Unfortunately, all the replies are still on separate strings. Get another app, like Google Messenger, Textra, Evolve SMS, etc. With all the benefits of this phone, I could not rate this phone below a five star."

I'm not a power user by no means I only play a couple of games that my Moto G can handle well and Internet browsing but this phone would constantly close my apps without an error and delete all the progress I had done with it. Not to mention using it in the lowest screen light would still make the phone so hot it would hurt to hold, and even iny pocket without use it would do it. Never had a defective Sony phone before and I got this brand new I honestly think thats just how it was supposed to work, which didn't work for me. I guess if you want a reliable phone and don't use apps or the Internet a lot I would recommend it."

"390072","Sony Xperia M4 Aqua 16GB GSM/LTE Unlocked Cell Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",5,"Bought cause my Z1s was damaged beyond repair and I've only had this one a few days. So far it has been great however I'm not a heavy user of apps and games. I'm hoping the heating and locking and slowing down problems I've read about are simply due to the early lolipop upgrades which nearly bricked my Z1s when it first came out, it was aweful, but after a long while and updates it finally started running smoother and cooler. I really like not having to pull a clip/door open and close every time I want to charge this one. The headphone plug doesn't seem quite as sturdy but if it works it works, the sound with my sony earbuds (the best earbuds for price too) is louder and seems to sound better on the M4 Aqua which is also good. I keep wifi and bluetooth turned off and it seems like it will last about the same maybe a little bit longer on average but not much, maybe could push 3 to 4 days with little to no use during that time, estimating 8 to 24 hours on a heavy day. Direct charging speed from wallwart usb seems pretty fast to me, still slow if usb from my laptop. Over all there are subtle differences, but nothing really bad or nor great, I love the sleek flat design of xperias, abd tho I know support kind of sucks, I'll keep my fingers crossed, I'll remain a Sony fan."

Testers go out of their way to really torture this phone on youtube (see xperia m4 aqua nutella, knife, waterproof) and this ip68 rated phone does really well. I love this phone and am considering their tablet now. Water And dust proof, beautiful design, memory slot. What more to ask for? Laugh at those fools that spend nearly a grand on these 'smart phones', and then end up getting it wet or shattering it. No nense in spending that especially when you will replace them in a year or two. Thats just being a dumb user and giving money away to the company so the can build a spaceship campus. Battery life is impressive: with everything on (broadband data, wifi, bluetooth) and normal use (texting, phone, some surfing) it can go 3.5 to 4 days between full charge. The full charging itself is very fast, i say under 2hrs. This is all without Sonys battery saving modes! I'm testing the two battery saving modes now. Incredible phone, and looks very nice. Buy this phone for 2-3 hundred, spend another 15 on nice rubber case and glass screen protector.

"390107","Sony Xperia M4 Aqua 16GB GSM/LTE Unlocked Cell Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",1,"So after long deliberation about my first smartphone, I chose the Sony Xperia M4 Aqua. I have had Sony Ericsson phones before that were very sturdy so I was hoping for something similar. My husband trusted my judgement, and also needed a new phone, so we ended up ordering two. We've had them for seven weeks now;Frankly, I am very disappointed. If I have one word to describe this phone, it would be: slow. I did not install that much apps or anything, but when switching on the phone, it just takes a long time. Also, when opening social media apps like whatsapp or facebook, it just keeps switching off and on while you are typing, extremely annoying. Taking a picture of something that is not a still object, is practically impossible. It takes 3-4 sec to take the shot, which is a very very long time. So you end up always missing that one moment. And when you take the picture, after a few seconds you see a frame being 'saved' but this is not the picture you end up with. So blurry pictures are now a big part of my library, unfortunately.Even worse with the video recording - without any sign that something is wrong, they can end up completely black. I was taping two of our friends saying 'I do' at their wedding, and afterwards it turned out there was absolutely nothing on the tape (you did see that something was taped though, and I could 'play' it, but as said, it is completely black). Next video I tried turned out fine - no idea why. But again, I missed the big moment because of the phone.When someone calls and you just touch the screen somewhere to pick up the phone, you are disconnected most of the times.My husband's phone stopped working after five weeks of light use - microphone did not work in 4 out of 5 times. He had to ship it to be looked at and has to miss his phone 15 business days without any replacement. This is completely unacceptable for a brand new phone! He should just get a new one, if you ask me.Also, be careful when placing the phone in your pocket, because the back tends to become really, really hot- almost too hot to touch at one point. Can not be healthy to walk around with, close to your body.And the last thing I do not like is the fact that it is too big for my hands, but that's just because I have rather small hands.What do I like -- I like the design- I like the fact that it's water proof, however did not put this to the test yet- I like the the ringtones- I definitely like the battery life (two days easily), takes at least 6 hours to recharge though.But I would not recommend it to anyone.UPDATE: in looking for a solution for the videos always turning out black - I found that this is an issue that is often reported and well know to Sony. Their only solution is to restart the phone. Then 1 or 2 videos can turn out OK."

"390109","Sony Xperia M4 Aqua 16GB GSM/LTE Unlocked Cell Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",4,"I got this on a lightening deal for $200 bucks. However, I want to address some claims. Unless you are a very light user you will not get two days off a charge. If you are a heavy user, you might not get one day. I'm a moderate user and typically end the day in the 20%'s, which is good compared to my old iPhone. In spite of reviews, games with a lot of graphics do not play well with this phone, a lot of lag. Angry Birds, Minion Rush, laggy. Camera is a big disappointment, slow to turn on and slow shutter response. Quality is ok, you just never know when you're going to get the picture taken. Other apps all work well without lag. I really like the thinness of the phone and the 5"" screen. Audio connected thought Bluetooth is loud. Call quality is ok. Works great with Android Pay."

This phone has all the features as other smartphones, but still maintains its low price. The front, and back cameras are both very clear. The flash on this Sony phone is bright and gives you the right lighting to take capture every moment. The phone features excellent speakers to listen to music. Watch a movie, or anything else you want. I would recommend this phone to anybody looking for a nice smartphone, that isn't crazily priced."

Tried to fix it using several different versions of Sony's software updater to little effect. Stuck on a boot loop... got as far as Sony logo followed by the regular blue wave screen then shuts off and restarts. First update got the Sonly logo with dark back ground shuts off and reboots. Second update after i got a message from sony that there was an update for this phone.. Now it's a white background with the sony logo and it shuts off and reboots. Been too busy to get warranty service got as far as getting an RMA only to have no time (and little access to a printer) and having it expire.The good news is the phone ran fantastic before this. I could not recommend a better phone at this price range. I only write this review because I saw it for the price I bought it for.Update 10/11/2016Tried another new update from sony still stuck on the bootloop. This is just becoming my own fault. I should of made the time to finally get the RMA and return this phone. Meanwhile bought a BLU phone with amazon ads... that one is working almost as good as this one when it was working."

After a google search we weren't the only ones experiencing this problem. Haven't experience overheating but do get random power off where only a hard reset will solve it, not reliable if it shut off and you're expecting calls or alarms. The seller and shipping was great, not so much the phone. I say pass and get something more reliable and less bloatware."

I have not experienced the battery lasting and entire 24 hour period yet or a 14 hour period where I didn't have to recharge this phone. My advice is, if you plan to take an extended trip some where be sure to take your charging cable and a spare charge.I do like the phone anyway."
"390135","Sony Xperia M4 Aqua 16GB GSM/LTE Unlocked Cell Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",5,"I originally wanted the Sony Xperia Z3, but for less than half the price I finally decided to buy the M4 Aqua GSM/LTE Unlocked. All in all it's a great phone (so far after 1 month). Build quality is good, processor is fast, and the screen is beautiful. Battery lasts for 2-3 days but I'm not a heavy user. Regarding the heating/overheating issues mentioned in other reviews, I only encountered this while I was playing a game - the phone did seem hot but wasn't too bad because I was using a protective case and the phone performance wasn't affected. One other point: I previously used a Sony Xperia S and the camera was terrible - the camera on the M4 Aqua is much better and takes great photos so this is a definite improvement. I'm very pleased with this phone and for the price it's a winner!"

"390139","Sony Xperia M4 Aqua 16GB GSM/LTE Unlocked Cell Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",4,"So far I really like this phone based on previous phones I have had in the past. The specs on this phone are a bit outdated for 2016, but for the price and quality specs aren't everything trust me! The processor speed and internal storage of only 16GB might deter some from considering buying this M4, but consider what that means in real world functionality. The difference of a processor that is 1.2Ghz or 1.8Ghz in real word application is so minimal that the average smartphone user will NEVER notice the difference. What makes a huge difference is the smoothness of the OS and the skins companies overlay on top of a platform like ANDROID. I have used NEXUS brand phones with similar processing speed and I have noticed a slight difference in the smoothness of the OS, but I would attribute that to the fact that a purely vanilla ANDROID experience will always give you smoother performance when compared to other phones that come with ""bloatware"" or other skins. That being said, I think SONY does a pretty good job of not overly bogging down the processor of this phone with its pre-installed bloatware. (But yes it comes with bloatware that really impacts your storage, so delete as much of the bloatware as you can, your battery and phone will thank you!)Pros:The PriceThe Build Quality (very premium feel)The Speaker Quality is better than average, but not the best I've heardCall Quality is Crisp on T-Mobile's networkAndroid 5.0 is the Current version installed ( I consider this a pro because of the issues I've heard about 5.1 on other devices...very subjective opinion)The Design is clean and not too outlandish very classic design to it.The Touch Screen is very responsiveAnd the Charge time is excellent for a phone with this sized batteryCons:The Screen Smudges with finger prints like nobody's buisnessThe battery though it charges fast, seems to drain even faster. This is most likely a user issue and if you're like me and have a Pebble and Fitbit tethered to your phone ALL DAY I guess battery drain like that is to be expected, but the claims of not having to charge your phone for 3-7 days is definitely untrue.The camera is not good at all. Very slow focusing and the pictures appear to be overly saturated. The pixels are way too visible for any type of definition, so beware!I also don't care for the pre-installed apps that take a majority of the memory space. (An SD card will absolutely be needed, so if you are going with this phone, please order on along with it.Summation:In all the price and build quality is a plus for a phone that is 2 years old. The smartphone industry moves fast and there is always a better phone that is better than the BEST phone out there....(does that make sense?) I try not to compare any phone too heavily with others that are clearly in a different class or category. This is not an iPhone 6 nor is it a Samsung Galaxy S6, so please don't compare it to those. But for everyday use for people who value a good value, I would recommend the SONY line and especially the M4 or comparable models. I do appreciate support that Sony offers on its products, and that alone helps me to be confident that I can get ""some support"" software wise and otherwise with this product. If you're considering this phone for yourself or spouse or other...it's a good buy in my opinion.Hope it helps you with your decision.Cheers!"

"390150","Sony Xperia M4 Aqua 16GB GSM/LTE Unlocked Cell Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",3,"I picked up this phone when it was a little less in price due to the water proof capabilities. I have always liked the little UI improvements Sony has done to the Android interface. It isn't overdone and bloated like the Samsung's, its way more elegant and simple in my opinion. It's much closer to a ""stock"" android experience. Also the stamina mode is a cool addition, depending on how you use your phone of course.The only thing that is holding this phone back is the bad snapdragon processor(Snapdragon 615) that is in this device. It isn't bad per se, but it over heats so quick it throttles the processor back so it makes the phone feel slower than it should be. This is the same issue that the Snapdragon 810 had. If this phone didn't have this processor it would be so much easier for me to suggest to someone.The phone itself is nice. Its thin, light and fits fairly well in the hand for a 5"" phone. It isn't the narrowest phone out there, like the newer xperia xa, but it isn't horrible. O yeah, its also water and dust proof! I don't do any heavy gaming on my mobile devices so I can't comment on that. The none 3D heavy games functioned fine for me though(it does get hot on the back though).This phone is updated to android 6.0.1 so it's good that sony kept up with that. I'd assume this is going to be the last update it gets.Battery life was good for me. I'll give some info on how I use my phone so you can compare. I use 3 mail aps for email, with one of them being the included gmail app. Facebook, snapchat, some news feed aps, hangouts for sms and another 2 social aps. With using all those a few times over a 10 hour span I was over 60% all of the time. Thats very good for me and comparable to an iphone 6 I also have.Overall I do like the phone, but the snapdragon 615 holds its back from being a truly good phone."

"390152","Sony Xperia M4 Aqua 16GB GSM/LTE Unlocked Cell Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",4,"I need to preface this entire review by saying I am a lifelong Mac and iOS user. This is my first Android phone, and it was purchased for a very specific purpose; I wanted a waterproof device to use for web browsing, reading, and messaging while I was on the beach or in the tub. I didn't want a device that would replace my primary iPhone 6s Plus. I just wanted an affordable device that was durable, and I wouldn't be sad about breaking if it did. Since Apple doesn't make a waterproof phone or tablet at this time, I had to look elsewhere. This is how I came up with the M4 Aqua.At the time of ordering the M4 Aqua, it was $149. I didn't know anything about Android, but having been updated to the latest Android OS (Marshmallow), it seemed as if this price was a steal. In retrospect, I would have paid as much as $200 for this device.Coming from iOS, Android OS is complete culture shock. Things don't ""just work"" like they do with Apple's offerings, and I often found myself needing to take three steps to do something that would have been one step on iOS. However, this wasn't supposed to be a replacement phone, so that being said it makes an excellent complimentary device. Actually, it is more than just a complimentary device. Despite its many failings when compared to iOS, I quickly fell in love with the ultra customizable nature, and all around gadget like feel of Android OS on the M4 Aqua. I have an IT background, and I like tweaking options and squeezing extra battery or performance out of my devices. It's like a fun little challenge to me. So I actually realized that I've been missing out. As much as I love the reliability and increased productivity that iOS gives me, I loved the ability to mess around with so many options. That's enough about my first time Android experience, let's talk about the device itself.- The device feels great in my hand. It's plastic, and not glass like Sony's more elevated offerings. However, it still looks and feels like a premium phone.- Obviously it's water resistant. I tested this multiple times. I made sure the SIM card and SD card slot were securely closed each time. The headphone jack and the usb port remain open during submersion though. As crazy as it sounds, it always works fine after a dunk. I would always wipe it off before using it again though. This is simply because it's impossible to use a wet phone screen well.- The camera is downright terrible. I don't know if it's the sensor, or the software, but it's just awful compared to my iPhone 5, let alone my iPhone 6s Plus. Do not buy this device for the camera.- This device lags a bit. Compared to iOS, but also compared to other Android devices, the Snapdragon in this thing just can't keep up all the time. That being said, the device is wonderfully useable in most casual scenarios. Things like web browsing, messaging, emails, and social media, give no problems at all.- Games run terribly on the Aqua M4. Minecraft Pocket Edition has this constant choppiness regardless of how turned down the graphics settings are. I had this experience with almost any game I played. Oddly, Pokemon Go worked great. That being said, don't buy this device for playing games. Also, it's not capable of the Sony Remote Play for remote PS4 sessions, so don't buy it for that purpose either.- Battery lasts a day with average use. I don't know where Sony gets their two day battery number from, but it would be almost impossible to use this phone normally and get 16 hours out of it let alone two days. That being said, I had no problem getting a whole day of battery out of the phone. I was pleased with this.- Wifi is fast and snappy. I have a set of Eeros in my house, and this device had no problem connecting and offering great speed.- The Micro SD card slot is helpful, and kind of necessary. 16GB is great for a casual user like me, but if you want to do anything above and beyond you're going to need some extra storage. Once I updated to Marshmallow, I had 8 gigs left of the 16 available.- The included headset actually sounds pretty good. I was surprised by this. I use Apple Music on my Aqua M4 of course since I'm an iOS user primarily, and it always sounded terrific with the included headset.- The speaker itself is horrible. I wouldn't expect too much out of this. Again, almost every iPhone speaker back to the 3G is superior to the speaker in this phone.- Phone calls sounds great, and this is the one place where the speaker in the phone doesn't give you any trouble. Speaker phone usage on this guy is actually better than on my 6s Plus. This is both in terms of them hearing me, and me hearing them.- The screen size is perfect. Somehow Apple really missed the boat on this one. This screen is slightly larger than an iPhone 6s, but smaller than an iPhone 6s Plus. I truly wish Apple made a single phone that was this size, instead of its current offerings. For a male with medium sized hands, this thing fit perfectly. I typed consistently better on it than my iPhone SE or iPhone 6s Plus when in vertical mode.- I can't tell for sure, but I don't think this phone has an accelerometer. Pokemon Go can't find it for the purpose of augmented reality, and the auto rotation for phone orientation works terribly. So that would make sense.- Apps are slow to start, but once you're in an app things seem to cruise along fairly smoothly.- Having been an iPhone user, I find the vibration motor in this thing to be SUPER strong. It is loud, and would vibrate right off a table if I wasn't careful.All in all, I love this phone for my purposes. It's sleek. It's thin. It's from my second favorite hardware company in the world, Sony. It's water resistant. It's dust proof. It's bright enough to use in the sun. It has enough battery to make it through the day. It really makes a perfect second phone. I really love this thing.As a random side note, I thought I was getting a white phone and although the box had a white phone on it, my phone ended up being black. I didn't mind, but I was surprised.It's a bit sluggish to recommend as a daily driver, but it would be a great gift for someone who needs a second phone that is water resistant, or someone who hasn't had a smart phone before.Sony, great job for making a phone that still holds up almost two years later!"

It has served its purpose well enough.Pros:- Not too big (it's getting hard to find a 5"" screen anymore).- Waterproof (though we haven't tested it much, we have accidentally spilled liquid on it and it didn't break).- Reasonable specs.- Android Marshmallow 6.0.1 update recently released (installed it through Sony's Xperia Companion PC application).- Good support for AT&T and T-mobile frequency bands (including 3G AWS and LTE band 12, which are not easy to find)- SD card support.Cons:- Camera is not great.- Sony firmware is not great (have run into various ridiculous bugs -- like Google voice not working with Sony's dialer, and the front camera not working -- and it has been slow to update, though the latest firmware seems to work well).- No option for more than 16GB internal storage.- Have to jump through hoops to use adoptable storage in Sony's released Android Marshmallow 6.0.1 firmware.I paired this with a PNY U3 Turbo Performance 32GB SD card (which I think cost ten bucks when I got it). With the Marshmallow update, I am using the SD card as adoptable storage, and as the storage backing the /storage/emulated/0 space (so it is the default spot for pictures, app data, etc). Sony's released firmware doesn't totally support this, so you have to enable it using ADB, which is annoying, but not a killer. I have the card formatted 70/30 between adoptable and portable storage, because the Sony camera app doesn't like the SD card being the default internal storage. The storage space reported in settings->storage also is a little wonky. But other than that, it works fine. Performance in the adoptable storage setup is fine.With the adoptable storage setup, I now have enough free space in the default media storage location use Google's camera app (since for whatever reason Google hates SD cards, and so their camera app has no option to save to SD). Google camera seems to capture better images than Sony's built-in one.UPDATE Oct 2016: Sony released a new firmware version for this phone. Nothing super exciting (the only thing I noticed was that the android security patch level went from Apr 2016 to Jul 2016). But I thought it was worth mentioning that even though Sony has said there will be no new Android versions released for this phone, that it still released an updated firmware package with security patches."

"390163","Sony Xperia M4 Aqua 16GB GSM/LTE Unlocked Cell Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",1,"the reason i gave this phone a bad review is not because its a bad phone but because the sellers from amazon screwed me by knowingly giving me a bad phone because at the time i was purchasing this phone it was out of stock i went and bought a like new version of this phone it was described as in new working condition just and open package that and it was close to the original price to sadly it arrived in very poor packaging and when i tried to insert my sim card it did not register it i called sony and after 2 weeks of software updates and troubleshooting i sent it to a sony repair center where it took around a month for them to fix it and charge me $60 to replace the sim card holder inside the phone now the phone works fine and i love it the only cons i can think of this phone is that the battery life isnt as great as they advertise its average and the camera quality is ok other than that its a great phone and i would recommend this phone to anyone to buy NEW not any other options"

I've kept the phone in excellent condition with a case and this still happened, I expected more from and ""outdoor water proof phone"" I never did test how water proof it is but I'm afraid it'll stop working if I do, now I have to buy a new phone since this one sucked. I bought it in December and it's now mid April so 5months of life then it goes to s***"
"390179","Sony Xperia M4 Aqua 16GB GSM/LTE Unlocked Cell Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",5,"the phone is 7.3 mm. It's pretty slim and feels sturdy in your hand. The power and volume buttons are weirdly placed at the right middle side of the phone. In my case, this proves to be a good thing because I have small-medium hands. There is one front facing speaker, SD card slot on the left, charging port on the left, micro simcard on the right, a headphone jack on the top, and a camera button on the bottom right( to take photos instead of touching the screen) . The back of the phone is plastic but looks like glass. The back and front of the phone are very vulnerable to scratches; I recommend buying a screen protector and cover. There are no physical home buttons. The phone is water proof, but you should wipe your screen after putting it in water as it tends to become unresponsive when you touch the screen.finally the phone is awesome."
"390180","Sony Xperia M4 Aqua 16GB GSM/LTE Unlocked Cell Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",2,"Gets heated for basic use only, worst battery life ,quite slow sometimesNever expected this kind of product from Sony.The first update took more than 1 hr to complete.The only good thing about this phone is fits well in your hands.sleek and slim"

"390182","Sony Xperia M4 Aqua 16GB GSM/LTE Unlocked Cell Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",4,"Overall I like the phone, I can't hear it when it rings if I;m out in the world. I only hear it if I'm sitting quietly in a quiet place. The other thing I don't like is that I can't write emails in blue. My last phone allowed me to write emails in color if I wanted to, and this one doesn't allow it. The phone makes nice noises though, I like the ring tones, and I like the chime noise when I get a text. It takes nice pictures, and it works very well apart from the fact that I can't hear it some times. I have normal hearing by the way."
"390183","Sony Xperia M4 Aqua 16GB GSM/LTE Unlocked Cell Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",3,"I have to agree with everyone that says, ""the phone has a heating problem."" Apart from the heating issue for minimal use; the phone lags doing stuff that my Nexus 4(2012) does with out lag. I bought it for $145 and it is what it is. I do like the look."
"390184","Sony Xperia M4 Aqua 16GB GSM/LTE Unlocked Cell Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",4,"This phone is awesome. I've yet to try and see just how water proof it is, but I imagine it holds up to exactly the standard it says it does. As for the performance, the phone is pretty snappy, especially when android Lollipop is installed. All the features of a phone work as you'd expect them to e.g. Bluetooth, Wireless, Calls, Texting, etc. The phone looks amazing and takes amazing pictures as well. The media experience for music, pictures, and video all have a nice appearance and easy navigation. Definitely recommend this phone. The only downside is that it can get rather warm when charging in a car. And the micro USB port is in a bit of an odd spot (Top left side of the phone)."

The second one the display went out, and the screen would not display at all. The third one, the most carefully taken care of, reboots at random and has a different issue with the screen pixelating.

"390192","Sony Xperia M4 Aqua 16GB GSM/LTE Unlocked Cell Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",1,"A few Sony phones have a known issue with their ear piece speaker (this model included), and you will have to wait for months to get it repaired/replaced even under warranty."
"390193","Sony Xperia M4 Aqua 16GB GSM/LTE Unlocked Cell Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",2,"This was my second Xperia and had me missing my old Xperia. I had to return after the ear speaker started to sound extremely low after 6 months of use. The phone gets really hot during calls because it's a very thin phone. The front camera is a joke, it looks very dark even if I turn on a bright as hell light near it. The pixel resolution looks good but my face looks like I'm 50 years older unless I turn on the smooth face beauty option in the settings. To take a picture in the rear camera you have to be very still because it lags several seconds. I have t-mobile and I have to use WiFi calling a lot and this phone I would be lucky to catch a chance for my call to go through and catch a signal to make a call, I've never had this issue in my t-mobile Xperia phone. Aside from all this, the interface is great, super fast. This advertises as a one year US warranty and this is misleading because I sent Sony an email and they said they couldn't give refunds and to contact amazon. They didn't even offer to give a replacement, only to do a software repair (which is like a factory reset). So I did it all and Amazon gave me 177 back when I paid 199.99 after 6 months of use. I really hope they don't sell the phone here that I sent back. I really wanted to love this phone but I couldn't take it anymore, I'm disappointed."
"390194","Sony Xperia M4 Aqua 16GB GSM/LTE Unlocked Cell Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",2,"This is not the worst phone in the world, but it's really not that good either. After about 2 months, the battery started pooping out, and now after 4 months, the battery only lasts about 5 hours before it's done, that is, as long as I don't use it, If I spend about 20 minutes in the morning looking at facebook, or using it in any other way, I get about 3 hours. It's just not a quality phone, it has plenty of features, but it's slow. This is a very slow phone. All in all, this phone isn't worth the money. I did bring it into the swimming pool with me, and there were no leaks or problems at all, so that's a plus. As person who's lost several phones to water, this phone meets that expectation, but overall, this phone is lacking"

When someone called me they couldn't hear me at all, so it made the phone quite useless. I tried to love the phone, the build material is great and feels good in the hands. The waterproof design is a huge bonus the Sony UI is also simple and clean but quite buggy at times.

"390209","Sony Xperia M4 Aqua 16GB GSM/LTE Unlocked Cell Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",3,"For the sub-$300 price, this device sounds great on paper. It turns out it's MOSTLY okay. Mine is currently about to be sent back to Sony, but more on that in a moment.The design mirrors the xperia z3 for the most part, but that's a matter of taste really so I won't say much except to note that the glass back panel on the z3 has been replaced by a very scratchable PLASTIC panel on the m4 aqua. That's ok at this price range. One major downside of this device that actually also affects the flagship z3 (and z5!) is the screen-to-body ratio. The top and bottom bezels on this device are LARGE. This is a phone with a 5"" screen, but it's about a large and unwieldy as my LG G3, which has a 5.5"" screen. It's also quite slick, due to the rounded edges. Nice looking, but not really ergonomic.Yes, this device has a 720p screen. That doesn't bother me, but be aware if that is a problem for you. Performance, on the other hand, is surprisingly ...MEH. The Snapdragon 615, while definitely a mid-range CPU, should really make this thing at least ""feel"" snappy with regard to the interface. However, I really find the whole experience often quite laggy, with poor multitasking, despite the accompanying 2 GB of RAM. Again, at this price point, not a dealbreaker. However, there are many devices on the market using the same processor, and even lower end Snapdragons such as in the 2015 Moto G, which still manage to have very snappy interfaces at the same or lower price.Camera performance is very disappointing. In extremely bright outdoor lighting, you can definitely capture some great STILL shots. Indoors, or with moving subjects, do expect much less than stellar image quality. Furthermore, the camera is unacceptably SLOW. After shooting, expect several seconds to pass before you can take another shot. There's really no excuse for this. Using a third-party camera such as Google Camera or Camera FV-5 are lightyears ahead in speed. I'm extremely confused that Sony considered this performance acceptable, even on a midrange device.NOW, onto my return to Sony. I've had this phone for only a month. Yesterday, the earpiece simply stopped working when making or receiving calls. The speakerphone is still functional, but that's hardly something I could live with, considering the fact I've only had this device for a few weeks. I did my best to troubleshoot, to no avail. Then factory reset the phone. When that didn't work, I tried to chat with an Xperia Care agent who suggested I try some diagnostics in the service menu. No dice. He then insisted that I completely reinstall the system software using Sony's PC Companion software and get back to them if that didn't work. Well, surprise of the year, it didn't solve anything. After chatting with a second Xperia Care rep, I was told I had to CALL for an actual RMA. So, call I did. To my disappointment, I was not even provided a return shipping label with my RMA number. I was furthermore warned several times that if there was any sign of water damage that my warranty would not be honored. Now, there is certainly NOT any water damage to my device. However, for a phone highly touted as waterproof (or at least highly water-resistant), that's just a major turn-off.We'll see how the RMA goes, I guess. I really only bought this device to tide me over while I waited for a Z5, but it served as a pretty good audition! I've decided I definitely do not want another Xperia! At less than half the price of a Z5! I'm always trying to find the bright side, ya know.Sigh...Don't buy this phone. Or do! It's quite inexpensive, at least."

"390230","Sony Xperia M4 Aqua 16GB GSM/LTE Unlocked Cell Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",4,"UPDATE: Decreased from four stars to two stars. Reasons:1. As other reviewers have said, this phone heats up. A lot. It will turn off without any sort of warning due to overheating. It's been barely four months since I purchased it and this keeps happening more and more often. At first I thought it was because I was pushing it too far with the simultaneous app usage; but it has collapsed while on stand-by.2. It doesn't hold a charge. Unless you have it perpetually in ""Stamina Mode"", this phone barely gets through the day. I'd say not even 15 hours straight.3. Faulty GPS location. If you buy this phone, be prepared to miss exits and having to stop at the side of the road while it syncs.BOTTOMLINE: Honestly, I'm experiencing all the issues I had with my old Huawei Ascend after 2.5 years of use. I'm even beginning to think I was sold a used mobile instead of a new one. Don't let the stylish exterior fool you, there are better phones within this price range. Don't waste your money on this and buy a Huawei P8 or similar instead.----OLD REVIEW:Sturdy, mid-range phone that does the job without wrecking your wallet.ProsGreat soundLoud speakersGreat graphicsGood enough rear cameraGood reception and superb noise-reductionConsFrontal camera is useless under poor lightTons of pre-installed apps (both google and sony loaded it with their junk)Delayed response (a second or two, sometimes)"

"390239","Sony Xperia M4 Aqua 16GB GSM/LTE Unlocked Cell Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",3,"Shipped and received quickly by Amazon. Light and attractive phone. Responsive touch screen. Plastic backing consistent with mid-level make and likely contributes to its light weight. I started with Android system so the transition to this phone was simple via Sony's software and previous backups. Back camera at 13MP was sluggish and had reasonable quality under good lighting; don't expect action shots or quality pictures under poor lighting conditions. Unfortunately, the front camera was nonfunctioning on arrival so I couldn't assess its quality; the good news is that Amazon is great about exchanges. Will update when replacement arrives."

"390250","Sony Xperia M4 Aqua 16GB GSM/LTE Unlocked Cell Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",1,"HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE! This phone malfunctioned and was unusable after only 2-3 months of owning it. I purchased a case and screen protector with the phone and take very good care of it. The phone was under warranty when it completely broke and I immediately sent it off for warranty repair/replacement. Sony Xperia technical support claims that a repaired or replaced phone will be returned to you within 14 business days of receiving the phone. Sony has had the phone for a month now. I have called many, many times to ask for a status update. I was initially told that the status is currently ""a work in progress"" but that they will request more specific information and provide this information to me in 2-3 days. I never heard back and had to call again, to be told AGAIN that it was a ""work in progress"". I have called a total of 8 times since the 14 business days have expired. I was told that this case was labeled to be expedited. Then it was flagged as requiring immediate attention by a supervisor. Still no word.When I last spoke with the supervisor of the call center, I was told that the supervisor had complained to the repair facility about the lack of response from them. However, there was nothing else that could be done. Apparently, there is no phone number for the repair facility in Illinois that either I, or the supervisor at the call center in the Caribbean, can use to contact them. Also, Sony refuses to simply send me a new phone despite the fact that it is well past their policy of 14 business days before the phone will be repaired or replaced.This is horrible customer service to a degree that is hard to put into words. Their system is so inadequate that I can't even explain it all here. There is no oversight and no accountability for totally disregarding their own policy and for the dissatisfaction of their customers. The bottom line is if your Sony cell phone breaks at no fault of your own immediately after purchasing it, you're screwed.Not only will I never purchase a Sony cell phone again, I will avoid all Sony products as there are many competitors with much better customer service on the market."
"390251","Sony Xperia M4 Aqua 16GB GSM/LTE Unlocked Cell Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",3,"I got this with a warehouse deal for $139, at that price this is a great phone.The form factor is durable and attractive, but it is incredibly light. Antenna reception is good (at&t) The screen is not full HD, but the resolution difference is not that noticeable. The battery life is about a day and a half of moderate usage, and the stamina mode is impressive.Under light usage its very snappy and quick but under any kind of demand it boggs down. If I have 3+ tabs open in google chrome with queued videos it will start to freeze. Same goes for when multitasking demanding apps. (in my case torque and chrome).Further, it does not have a gyroscope so no google cardboard.There is also no screen activation without using the physical button (such as swipe up / double tapping the screen).As of 6/14 only android 5.0 officially."

"390255","Sony Xperia M4 Aqua 16GB GSM/LTE Unlocked Cell Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",2,"I was really excited and looking forward to using this, but usability is exactly where it falls flat.First, when I run common apps, such as Google Music and Apple Music, the apps will just randomly shut down. There were a few others apps, like Avast, that just would not reliably run. Bottom line, app stability, from major companies, on this phone is bad.Second, the cameras, front and back, are marketed as excellent with good low light performance, but that is just not the case. Low light performance is quite poor, while both cameras suffer from abysmal contrast.Didn't test out the water resistance, so I can't comment on that.Sony just cut too many corners to try and make a budget friendly phone, which lags behind other phones in this range, such as former flagships LG G3 & LG G4."

I can be using it and all of sudden it will restart. It can also just be sitting on the counter and I look over and it will be booting back up because it has restart it self again. Under Diagnostics it says it has had 108 incidents in past 10 days. I have contacted Sony but they require the phone to be sent in for repair and it can take couple weeks to get phone back. If I can find a backup I guess I will do this but I can not be without my phone. If these problems were known before time I would not have purchased this phone and/or would have returned it."

"390263","Sony Xperia M4 Aqua 16GB GSM/LTE Unlocked Cell Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",4,"Good product for the price. Would easily slip from your fingers though. A good solution is to purchase a rubberized case. There's an issue with the camera that I would like to point out though. There were times when I used the camera for video recording but upon playing the mp4 file, all that came out with the sound was a black screen. I thought I had a defective unit but this also happened to my wife's M4 Aqua. A simple work around that I found is to avoid using the stock camera and instead install a different camera app from Google Play store. I've never had the said video problem since.The processor is fast enough for my purposes which include using Google Maps for navigation, shopping, playing videos and playing music. I cannot comment on the overheating issue because I've never had that experience with this phone."

"390265","Sony Xperia M4 Aqua 16GB GSM/LTE Unlocked Cell Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",4,"Good phone at a great price. I'm coming from a Nokia 635. I really like that phone it was cheap and did everything I wanted it to do. Sure it wasn't great and didnt have a front camera but, Windows phone system was so easy to use. I really didn't want to make the switch to Android but, everyone says I miss alot by not using Android or Apple so I decided to see if I like the Android experience. If I didn't I like it I'd go back to windows phone with my next purchase. I really did my research while shopping for my next phone upgrade. I wanted an unlocked phone that cost around $200 had 16gb memory and microSD. I looked at the Alcatel Idol 3 (4.7 the 5.5 seemed too big), which I almost purchased but, the M4 aqua had a slightly better processor. I really liked the design of the Moto G 3rd gen but it was $20 more for the 16gb version and had a lesser quality processor. So far I've gotten accustomed to Android, or Sony's version of it, and it is pretty easy to use so no major learning curve coming from a Windows phone. The variety of apps are definitely greater, but as a casual user, there really isn't anything new that I am using that I did not use on my Windows phone.The phone itself has a pretty nice screen, I noticed the better quality coming from my Nokia 635. Sure, it doesn't compare with my friend iPhone 6 but, at 200 it doesn't have to. It come with 16gb and I had about 11gb left to use after the OS and pre-loaded apps. Sony advertises 2 day battery life. I have come nowhere near that using it casually. I don't use my phone hard. I check FB, emails, play a game once in awhile. I'm usually down around 30% when I go to bed and that is using battery stamina mode but, that's about equal to most smartphones these days so no real complaints. But I think you'd only get to 2 days if you dont use data, wifi and keep the brightness low, so false marketing on Sony, in my opinion. I noticed some complain the M4 gets hot but, I don't notice any excessive heat. Nothing worse than my old phone. I've not tried to get the phone wet so not sure how good that feature works but, its one less thing to worry about.Main complaints. the speaker. Horrible tiny sound, heck my Nokia 635 had better sound. Little disappointed since Sony should be able to do better. Headphones sound great but, speaker is bad. The camera take adequate shots, nothing great. I'm happy with it so far to post pictures on FB and such. The camera is slow though it takes a long time to take a picture, longer than I think it should take.Overall, I like my phone and should keep me going for 2 years or so until I replace it. I took a star off for the speaker, slow camera and Sony's marketing of 2-day battery life which is almost impossible to get."
"390266","Sony Xperia M4 Aqua 16GB GSM/LTE Unlocked Cell Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",1,"MY phone started having dead screen in the 3rd week of use and screen completely shut down in week 5. Until the last incident, I was able to bring the screen back on by hard reset/manual reboot.1. This phone isn't waterproof. And support will do anything to make sure warranty doesn't cover repair, first thing they ask is , did you put phone in contact with water or damage it? If so, we don't cover it under warranty.. : I told them i have absolutely no damage on the phone and additionally PHONE IS m4 AQUA(WATERPROOF) , insisted them that this has been happening since week 3. They finally told me to make a CALL instead of CHATTING to open a service case, and when i opened the case, the rep told me previous agent I was chatting with wrote that I cracked the phone screen and warranty will no longer cover this device.2. Like I said, shady and DISHONEST CUSTOMER SUPPORT. Google sends a replacement phone for their customers.3. I never had a phone that broke so fast (6 weeks), and I took care of it like a baby...4. Phone is ok, camera is def not good and phone is slow. It takes a while to boot up and even receiving messages. Logging in to applications take like 2 mins on this phone... IDK i wouldn't buy it again...5. Sony will not allow you to make a return. I simply don't want to use a Sony device anymore after this experience I've had and get a Samsung or Google, at least it works. I bought this phone cause it was cheaper than other android phones w same size.Reason i didn't send this phone in week 3 is, Sony has a 14 day period to evaluate is they will cover the repair under warranty. This 14 day period doesnt include shipping and repair time, also they don't send you a label unless u ask for it. And they told me it will take them 48 hours to send me a label. So if your phone broke, you will spend 30 days to get it back, and from their attitude i can tell they do their best to make you pay even if you have a valid warrent.I told them over and over again"

"390310","Sony Xperia M4 Aqua 16GB GSM/LTE Unlocked Cell Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",5,"I started using ios a few years ago. After a few years, I got bored of it. So I sold my iPhone and got this (it was on sale for$200). I got it 2 moths back (November 7). First thing, this is an honest review; I am not being paid to review this product.Build quality/ hardware- the phone is 7.3 mm. It's pretty slim and feels sturdy in your hand. The power and volume buttons are weirdly placed at the right middle side of the phone. In my case, this proves to be a good thing because I have small-medium hands. There is one front facing speaker, SD card slot on the left, charging port on the left, micro simcard on the right, a headphone jack on the top, and a camera button on the bottom right( to take photos instead of touching the screen) . The back of the phone is plastic but looks like glass. The back and front of the phone are very vulnerable to scratches; I recommend buying a screen protector and cover. There are no physical home buttons. The phone is water proof, but you should wipe your screen after putting it in water as it tends to become unresponsive when you touch the screen.Software- the phone is pre-installed with Android 5.0 and loaded with about 23 apps of which only around 7 are useful. After deleting apps and cache I had 12 gb left. The skin is very close to stock lollipop android. So far no apps have crashed. Something I found nice is the ability to record your screen when you long press the power button.Camera- I'm not a selfie guy, but alot of people take photos of their duck lips and food so I included this part. The camera is pretty good, but not the best. There are lots of settings to enhance your photo experience. Something I found fun was that is has a virtual reality camera mode that allows you to talk photos/videos of dinosaurs, undersea,etc. A very big setback is its lack of flash. So if you live in a dark cave, too bad. You can zoom in too, but it gets blurry and hard to adjust. Something I found useful is that the camera recognises where you are, so if your driving and taking a video it makes the videos look not blurry.Performance- Im a gamer, and performance is key in every product I purchase for gaming. The phone has 2 gigs of ram and a snapdragon 615. It tends to heat but not as much as lava on your hand. The heating problem is not a big deal. I have 21 games on my phone( no SD card) of which include modern combat 4, Nova, asphalt 8, minecraft, and terraria. These games played pretty well with occasional lag, although it's almost unnoticeable. The phone scored 25841on antutu, single core 527 on geekbench 3, and multicore 1905 on geekbench 3. Decent enough.Conclusion: overall I am very pleased and satisfied with the experia m4 aqua. It has a low price but simply beats others of its price range due to ram,waterproof, snapdragon 615, and good slim build. I would recommend this phone to anyone."

"390312","Sony Xperia M4 Aqua 16GB GSM/LTE Unlocked Cell Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",4,"I haven't had an android in a while. I've had an iphone 4s for about 2-3 years then I switched to this phone. I like this phone because battery is wonderful. I put it on airplane mode while at was at work and it only lost 10% in 12 hours. I wish It had some features that apple has, like seeing if someone read your messages, being able to reply to messages from the home screen. I freaked out one morning because I woke up and it wouldn't turn on even though it didn't die over night. For the price, it's great. Hope it lasts a long time, I don't feel like picking out another phone. I was also so used to the iphone that this phone felt big to me, but honestly it's a pro. I like the screen, everything looks more clear, sleek. Though it does get stuck in some apps, apple has a better processor, it doesn't happen too often so i can let it slide. Could've bought a samsung like everyone else, but my dad already had this phone and I got to experience it for a bit then got to make the decision to get it. Overall, good phone. Coming from an apple phone I just have to get used to it a bit, different features and processor."

"390335","Sony Xperia M4 Aqua 16GB GSM/LTE Unlocked Cell Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",1,"The phone is decent at first only real downfall is the speaker volume; however, after 2-3 months expect to have to replace the phone. I bought one on here in December and had to return it within a couple months as the speaker was going out. I thought maybe because it was a damaged box product. However, this is now the second phone that is approximately 2-3 months old and is having the exact same issue. I thought by spending the additional $$ I would save money in the long run because I am a mail lady and light water maybe a problem if I get caught in the rain. However, these phones were never even subject to the rain and yet they lasted less time than the Nokia Lumia's that I had in the past that were cheaper. I would have gotten the square trade warranty however, not available on this product... I wonder why does the manufacturer and vendor know something we don't know?"
"390336","Sony Xperia M4 Aqua 16GB GSM/LTE Unlocked Cell Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",5,"Absolutely Fantastic phone for the money.... I am very shocked at how good it is. It is only running Lollipop but I think that Sony added some customization to the operating system to improve battery life I listen to music for about six to eight hours a day. An I am on the internet quite a bit throughout the day and I still have at least 50% battery left when I leave at the end of the day to go home I am very happy with the camera as I have take pictures for work quite frequentlyThe SONY XPERIA line of phones are most definitely worth the money and buying UNLOCKED from Amazon mean no excess carrier bloatware added that always slows said phones down .Awesome Phone at a awesome price"

"390344","Sony Xperia M4 Aqua 16GB GSM/LTE Unlocked Cell Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",5,"I don't usually write reviews but after using this phone for a couple of weeks, I feel like it deserves the rating that I am giving. I've been switching from phone to phone for a couple of years now, first owning a windows phone, then samsung galaxy s4, asus zenfone 2, so on and so forth. This is the only phone that I felt was just right. The speed of it was a little slow at first but for some reason it sped up to the point where it is just right now. It comes with bloatware but you can disable it within the settings.One negative thing I really would consider for this phone is that you can't customize between USB connection modes.As everyone says, this phone does burn up, but with its $200.00 price line, this phone wasn't meant for long time gaming anyway. This is a really good practical phone to be using."

This one works perfectly once you remove all the pre-installed crapware. The screen and camera are way nicer than the professional reviewers say. It does a slide show screen saver thing with your pictures that was a welcome surprise for my wife. I don't like that sort of thing, but she loves it. The phone is amazingly thin. It actually makes me nervous, because it's so thin. But if it can survive this long (a few months) in my wife's purse, then it's rugged enough to survive anywhere. I like to dunk it just for fun."

I bought this phone on Cyber Monday 2015 as of today March 13th 2016 the phone took a dump on me. It keeps shutting off and there is no way to fix it. I contacted Sony and they emailed me a link to download Xperia Companion software to do a software repair on my phone. Well guess what. The phone has to be able to stay on longer than one minute to complete the software repair if that would even help who knows. I did a factory reset and it didn't help. They keep dodging my emails about sending me a new phone to replace this one as it is still under warranty. I heard that sony phones have major issues with overheating and that it causes massive failure with them. I'm assuming this might be the case but I'm not sure. I had a z1 and a z3 before this. z3 was buggy. No wonder all major carriers in the US dropped Sony phones. DO NOT BUY!! You will regret it. I thought some of the bad stuff I was reading were just one off's and that those things only happened once in a blue moon. WRONG!!! Failure is the norm with these phones. You WILL be very frustrated with this phone and have buyers remorse."

Tried to fix it using several different versions of Sony's software updater to little effect. Stuck on a boot loop... got as far as Sony logo followed by the regular blue wave screen then shuts off and restarts. First update got the Sonly logo with dark back ground shuts off and reboots. Second update after i got a message from sony that there was an update for this phone.. Now it's a white background with the sony logo and it shuts off and reboots. Been too busy to get warranty service got as far as getting an RMA only to have no time (and little access to a printer) and having it expire.The good news is the phone ran fantastic before this. I could not recommend a better phone at this price range. I only write this review because I saw it for the price I bought it for.Update 10/11/2016Tried another new update from sony still stuck on the bootloop. This is just becoming my own fault. I should of made the time to finally get the RMA and return this phone. Meanwhile bought a BLU phone with amazon ads... that one is working almost as good as this one when it was working."

"390387","Sony Xperia M4 Aqua 16GB GSM/LTE Unlocked Cell Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",5,"Only had the phone a day so keep that in mind when reading this review....My last phone was the Nexus 4. I had it just under 3 years. Great phone. Its lack of LTE bands and limited space (16GB with no SD card) was a problem. Other than that I'd still have the phone. I have no interest in paying the premium for a flagship phone as midrange phones are plenty for my needs. I tried a couple different refurbished phones but each on had problems...I assume because they were used/refurbished. So I knew I had to go with a new phone. I did get the invite for the OnePlus X but canceled my order when I decided that it lack too many LTE bands to be as useful as it could be in the US (really band 4 was the only option). I was thinking about getting a Z3 but even used ones were still way too expensive IMO. So I saw this one.I knew when I ordered it that it was not a flagship phone. It has a 13megapixal camera which is not flagship quality but...its not a flagship. The battery is only 2400+ which is low compared to flagship but...its not a flagship phone. CPU...not flagship quality but... you know.Its not a flagship phone but it is also 1/3 the price of a flagship phone. It offers all the gsm LTE bands you could want (for the US). Its thin. The battery isn't 2 days as Sony says but in the 1 day I've had it I've been impressed (Nexus 4 was smaller battery so this better). Camera is only 13megapixal but its better than the 8megapixal I was use to. Its practically stock android (something I am use to).On a personal note: I like the design of the phone. I never liked the rounded back you get on many phones now a days. I like when my lays on a table that it doesn't rock when you click on the screen. I like the relatively squared corners of the M4. It gives the illusion of a good phone to screen size ratio. I completely understand others might not share these opinions. Its just my preference.For the money its a good phone. For now I'll give it 5 stars as my limited experience has been nothing but great.While I appreciate what flagship phones give you (my Nexus 4 was a flagship phone in its time) and I could afford it if I wanted but what you get for the cost just doesn't out weigh a number of mid-range phones priced in the $~200 range.Edit #1 (1 week):Absolutely no complaints. Its a beautiful phone..especially in its price range. The battery has been absolutely fantastic for my use. I am confident I could get almost 2 days on my normal use. My more significant use (when my son gets his hands on it) does drain the battery faster but I can still get over a day with it. This is the first phone I've had where I know I do not have to plug it in during the day and can probably skip charging every night.Edit #2 (2 months):Fantastic phone. For the money I am shocked how good it is. It is only running Lollipop but I can only assume that the Sony customization to the OS has added something to improve battery life (like what Marshmallow gives you today). When I am at work I probably listen to music (from the SD card) for about 4-5 hours a day. Add in a little internet usage throughout the day and I still have ~60% battery life by the end of the day. As I said before when pushed the phone can drain quickly (son playing lots of games or watching YouTube videos) but for my normal usage this is quite nice for me. My Nexus 4 would not make to the end of my work day without needing to be plugged in if I did the same thing (music and some internet browsing).The camera is? Well the camera itself is quite nice. But the Sony camera software isn't quite right. Its slow. The Android camera app is a definite improvement. So I am not going to change my 5 star review for a slow camera app (that would be silly).I did find one problem though: I had paired my phone with my car (Honda Fit). Everything was working fine for days/weeks. Then one day I realized the car was not informing me of text messages from my phone. Seems the phone had some sort of issue with bluetooth and its saved pairing with the car seemed broken. I had to delete the pairing my phone and car had and recreate the pairing. Its been fine since then. Not sure what happened or what caused the issue but all seems fine now. I suppose if I could do 4.5 stars I'd consider lowering my review but since I cannot I am sticking with 5 as I think it is better that 4 stars. Plus....its possible my car was the problem and not the phone (but I did not have this problem with my previous phone).Anyways....love the phone."
"390388","Sony Xperia M4 Aqua 16GB GSM/LTE Unlocked Cell Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",5,"Great phone. Used it for about a month and have no problems. Battery lasts all day even with high usage. Only have 1 app that won't work because the company only has it available for IPhone or Samsung. Just had to get a different SIM card from my service provider to get started."
"390389","Sony Xperia M4 Aqua 16GB GSM/LTE Unlocked Cell Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",1,"Nice looking phone, but Sony sucks. Their quality control is completely ridiculous and constantly send out defective phones. The mic will work 2/5 times on this phone even while doing the diagnostic test."
"390390","Sony Xperia M4 Aqua 16GB GSM/LTE Unlocked Cell Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",4,"I got this phone to replace a broken LG G4 and I have to say it's a decent mid-range phone.Pros: Waterproof Sleek design Decent headset audio and speaker volumeOverall decent performance. Excellent battery life with stamina mode on, even with LTE. I got nearly four hours screen on time.2GB RAM is enough for multitasking.Seamlessly transitions from LTE to 3G to 2G depending on coverage area. Downloads are super quick on LTE (Panama's 10x10Mhz 700Mhz Band 28 LTE went as fast as 50mbps/20mbps dl/ul) Micro SD card support up to 128GB.Bootloader can be officially unlocked and there is a small custom ROM community on xdaCons: Can get laggy with games. Display is not as good as the Z3 seriesCamera quality is so-soGets a bit hot with extended use though it cools quickly.No double tap to wake like on the Z3 series.Comes with useless bloatware installed,luckily some of it can be eliminated.Overall. I'm happy with it for now."
"390391","Sony Xperia M4 Aqua 16GB GSM/LTE Unlocked Cell Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",5,"As always Sony is ahead of the pack of phones I have ever owned. I had several Sony's in a row and due to budget and carrier restraints I had a Windows phone for 6 months. Well I am back and while it is not the newest and best Sony offers it is by far more amazing than other phones I have tried from friends and relatives.The specs may be lower but it is to be expected from a mid-range phone after all. Honestly for me it is on par with the high range phones I had previously from Sony's Xperia line.If you are tired of waiting for the latest and greatest from one particular company who shall remain nameless, BUY A SONY AND GET MANY OF THOSE FUNCTIONS NOW RATHER THAN WAIT 1-3 YEARS FOR THEM TO CATCH UP.Yes, there is a heating issue with the phone, but logic just tells you if it is heating up too much it is time to put the phone down and get back to life.As for apps all my old favorites load perfectly well and several I was waiting to try are beyond amazing on this phone. Something I definitely could not say for my few apps on my Lumia phone prior to this.Essentially if you are looking for an amazing phone that will provide you with all the features and apps you need and have become used to having on Android, pick up this phone and support SONY as they have truly innovative products on the market.The SONY XPERIA line of phones is definitely worth the money and buying UNLOCKED from Amazon mean no excess carrier bloatware that slows the phone and makes any amazing phone seem to be a letdown."
"390392","Sony Xperia M4 Aqua 16GB GSM/LTE Unlocked Cell Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",4,"I have had the phone for a couple of weeks. Got it on a pre-black Friday sale for $199. For the price-point, it is a pretty good phone. The processor is pretty quick and it has 16GB memory with the capability of adding a microSD to expand an additional 128GB. I have a 32GB card in mine. It can free up space by transferring apps and files to the microSD with a touch of a button. That is a nice feature that my LG did not have. It also has the auto-screen brightness adjustment which isn't always offered in phones at this price-point. I have had a bit of a learning curve switching to Sony from LG, but it hasn't been too bad. My apps didn't all load automatically when I logged on with my Google account, which was a bit of a pain. (And one app was no longer available, so I lost that one entirely.) I haven't tried the headphones, but the Bluetooth works fine with my car stereo. The camera has all kinds of special features that I will most likely never use (like adding an animated dinosaur to your pictures). It seems like a pretty decent camera so far. Calling and texting work well. I did have to manually enter my APN settings for Net10, but that was simple enough. My daughter ended up getting one of these phones as well."

Although, the first phone I received would keep powering off on its own. But I contacted Amazon about the issue, and they sent me a replacement. This phone has all the features as other smartphones, but still maintains its low price. The front, and back cameras are both very clear. The flash on this Sony phone is bright and gives you the right lighting to take capture every moment. The phone features excellent speakers to listen to music. Watch a movie, or anything else you want. I would recommend this phone to anybody looking for a nice smartphone, that isn't crazily priced."

Figured I'd just buy a new phone. Didn't want to buy a current gen for $700 so I figured this next-up gen would be better. All I really want in a phone was that it was water proof(resistant now) and had a good battery. The z3 fit that bill easily so I thought the m4 would too. Everything about this m4 is less responsive than the z3. Touchscreen feels different/less responsive and apps loading/switching is less responsive. But hey, for the price it's not bad and it definitely fits what I'm looking for. Battery lasts forever on moderate usage and dunking it isn't a problem. Just wish it was better than the last generation."

But as many reviews said it has heating problem, On start when all applications starts- Mobile gets heated very quickly. But Good part is over the time in a minute or 2 it gets cool down.Heating problem is probably because of its Water proof feature. Since all body is air tight, very space for air ventilation inside."
"390427","Sony Xperia M4 Aqua 16GB GSM/LTE Unlocked Cell Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",2,"I switched from lumia 521 to this phone. Things that I missed are: 1) double tap to wake up the phone, 2) built-in call block feature, 3) longer battery life.This phone has a lot of Google bloat ware that cannot be uninstalled. It's taking up a lot of memory space. The phone gets very warm during prolonged use and charging.The most disappointing things are battery life and no call block feature. I have to install an app that adds to depleting the battery.In conclusion, this higher priced phone did not perform as well as my old lowest end lumia Windows phone. It is disappointing and way below my expectation."
"390428","Sony Xperia M4 Aqua 16GB GSM/LTE Unlocked Cell Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",5,"I've been a Sony user my whole life and I'm usually pretty pleased with them. Sony phones are super user friendly and I usually just like the overall quality of their phones, but this phone is a game changer! I feel like this is the most luxurious phone I've ever held! I take lots of pictures so the first thing I played with was the camera, and I started to get worried because I read reviews it wasn't that great, but I think its wonderful. It does very well in low light and it seems to fit more into the picture, it also has cute editing settings for those who like to play with pics. It set up very quickly and I was able to update and download all my old apps that I liked in a reasonable amount of time. I heard phone calls were quiet but I made a few phone calls and played with ringtones and they seemed loud enough to me, the dimmest brightness setting is still very bright, and I was able to send and receive mms very quickly which is something I've found to be on the slower side with Sony phones. I have yet to test just how waterproof the phone is but based on videos and other reviews I've read I'm betting it'll hold up through anything I could/would ever put it through. The phone took just under 2 hours to fully charge and it actually does last 2 days! I put it through at least 12 hours of internet streaming and made phone calls and texts before needing to charge it again at the end of the second day, also I had like 12 apps running at once before I decided to close them all and you'd never even know all those apps were running it was so fast! I definitely recommend this phone to anyone looking into it."

In the middle of the day, it shut off and now refuses to turn back on (the battery was at 60%).Aside from the fact that it no longer works, we were having trouble with various aspects of the phone. It would constantly switch networks in the middle of calls and then hang up on the person you're talking to. Additionally, the battery life *might* be good for 12 hours, and the GPS does not work---it updates two or three miles after you've missed the turn."
"390439","Sony Xperia M4 Aqua 16GB GSM/LTE Unlocked Cell Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",1,"Update: the phone has been under repair by sony for 6 weeks, ""waiting for parts"" with no information on when it will be sent back. That makes nearly 3 months of repair time in 7 months of ownership. This phone has gone back twice, and my daughter's Z3 Compact has gone back once for the side charge port coming off, and been fixed a second time by me for the same issue, along with a new back, which spontaneously shattered while sitting on a car seat about 1 week after the warranty expired.Well, I bought this phone for $200. But it is really a $400 phone since you have to buy 2 of them. One to use, and one to send back for repair. Actually a fine phone when it works. First phone had the screen fail after a few months, now replacement has the microphone and earpiece fail a few month later. A smart phone kinda needs a screen and a microphone and speaker. Like I say, just buy 2."
"390440","Sony Xperia M4 Aqua 16GB GSM/LTE Unlocked Cell Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",2,"Not the best quality. Doesn't really protect the cell phone, just by scratches."
"390441","Sony Xperia M4 Aqua 16GB GSM/LTE Unlocked Cell Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",1,"I have had overheating and shut off issues ever since I purchased this phone, but I sucked it up. In December a software update prevented the phone from restarting continually when it overheated. However, it still, overheated. In March the phone died. It Refused to charge it just gave up the ghost. I sent it to Sony for repair and one month later still no phone. It is impossible to speak with anyone at the repair center and the customer service is equally hopeless. My advice is to keep your money. If you are ever unfortunate enough to need a repair you will be on your own."
"390442","Sony Xperia M4 Aqua 16GB GSM/LTE Unlocked Cell Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",1,"Here is why. It arrived, I charged it, got it to the store and activated my sim for it with my plan, the problem with this phone is it constantly restarts. I've tried several things and no luck. Every time it updates an app or downloads something, it restarts. Your in the middle of doing something, it freezes for about 5 seconds... then restarts. It sits there and I'm not even using it, you guessed it, restarts. Also it gets hot, even after 1 minute of use. That is very irregular. I finally gave up after the third time it went unresponsive and black screen. Last night it ""stayed on"" somehow with a black screen and overheated. The battery was depleted when I woke and it was very hot. DO NOT GET THIS PHONE."

"390455","Sony Xperia M4 Aqua 16GB GSM/LTE Unlocked Cell Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",4,"Pros+Good Looking Design+Good Performance+Waterproof+MicroSD Expansion+Good Camera+Android Pay CompatibleCons-Okay Screen-Average Speaker-Average Battery Life-Decent Performance-Not the only good phone availableShould you buy: YESActual Value $200Sony has made a lot of great, if a bit too frequent, phones. With a waterproof design and glass construction, it has a great record of making phones. However, those phones had competition from Samsung, LG, among others that made it difficult to stand out. Sony, however, has decided to aim for the midrange market by making this: the Xperia M4 Aqua. In 2014, I would’ve recommended this phone instantly. However, in 2016, is it still a good buy among the rest of the excellent lineup of 2015? That is what I tried to find. In short, it is a good phone. But that leaves me conflicted as to where to place this phone in the current state of the market.-Design-Any similarities with any of the phones in the Xperia lineup is no coincidence. In fact, that is kind of its selling point; it doesn’t look like other phones in this price range. The glass found on the front and back is beautiful and feels premium in the hand and from any distance it looks like a much pricier phone. The Sony and Xperia label add a bit of class to this otherwise good looking budget phone. This also makes it a bit disappointing to find a plastic frame instead of a metal one that is found on its older brother. But considering its price, this is something that can be forgiven. In the hand, it feels light enough to easily carry but dense enough to feel like it won’t break easily. That being said, I recommend buying a case immediately in order to prevent any part of the glass from shattering. The front grills on the phone are nice, but they are a bit deceiving. The speaker, unlike the other Xperia, is actually on the bottom of the phone. The top one is an earpiece for calling and the bottom one is a microphone. There is also your typical power and volume rocker, along with a two-stage button. This last button that should be in all phones and I’m surprised that it is a rare thing to find these days. Overall, it is a good looking phone that should make most people happy.-Performance-The specs on this phone are good for the price. It is packing a Snapdragon 615 with 2GB of RAM, 720p display, Android Lollipop, and microSD card expansion. In benchmarks, the phone runs just above the Alcatel Idol 3 (4.7) but a great distance under the Samsung Galaxy S5. It is a respectable score for the price. However, it is a bit confusing in general use. It is snappy most of the time with general day to day task. But sometimes the bloatware that Sony adds to the phone makes it stutter a bit, particularly when multitasking a lot of apps. It never slows down completely or enough to get in the way, but it is noticeable. Most games, or any other graphic demanding app, do run well on this device without an issue with only the heaviest of games stuttering a bit. Apps also run smooth while they are open and even when going back to it while multitasking. In my practical testing, I can open up to 5 apps without any of them closing, including Chrome, Snapchat, YouTube, Amazon app, and Instagram. Signal quality, for the most part, is good. There are a few areas in my area of Los Angeles where I get a weaker signal than what I’ve experienced with OnePlus and Alcatel, but they are minor issues. My top speed running on the T-Mobile network was 54 Mbps download speed and 7 Mbps upload. Call quality is also good from both ends of the call, with both earpiece and loudspeaker providing loud volume and above average quality. While it does have the hardware to use Band 12, it is unable to use it since it doesn’t meet the requirement from T-Mobile. But it still performs well and should be great for most people.-Display-The phone has a 1280 x 720 HD display with a pixel density of 294 ppi. While on paper that does look like a lower level of pixel density than other phones it’s actually good enough for most people, with text looking slightly fuzzy when holding the phone right up close. Colors are good, but not excellent. They are good enough, but next to something like the S5, OnePlus, or even the Alcatel Idol 3 the colors look a bit washed out. The white balance is slightly towards the blue side, but it isn’t that noticeable. Thankfully, Sony does allow for tweaking the display settings should you want to make it good. Contrast and brightness levels, on the other hand, are great and they do allow for it to be usable in direct sunlight. Only thing I have of concern is the glass on the display. I have not found a confirm report as to what the glass is (Gorilla Glass, Dragontrail); the only thing I have found it to be listed as is “scratch-resistant glass.” Just something to keep in mind. Overall it is a decent screen, but there are better options available.-Camera-Sony has a reputation for making quality camera sensors, such as the iPhone and other flagships, so I was expecting some of that tech to drop down to their midrange phone. The result is good, but not much more than that. It comes equipped with a back-facing 13MP camera and a front, wide angle 5 MP camera. I couldn’t find any specific information on the sensor in the back, with Sony limiting themselves to only saying it is a Sony Exmor RS model, but no specific requirement in particular. Since there is no other phone that we can identify with this sensor, we’ll have to judge it independently with other phones in this price category. So, is it good? In general, yes. Photos taken in bright light come out excellent and the phone does focus quick on the subject or background that is being exposed. Colors are a bit lighter than what they are in real life, but it’s not a deal breaker. Low light is surprisingly good for the price. Sure, it isn’t up to the level of an S6 or a G4, but it is above what most other phones can deliver. The phone does suffer from motion blur, so nighttime shots are best left for tripod or steady hands. In short, it is a decent camera perfect for social media.-Software-The Xperia M4 comes with Android Lollipop 5.0 with some extras that range from good to completely useless. The phone has a custom Sony skin that would look okay if the other apps that you had look similar. But their round shape and overall design contrast to all the other apps that you might download. In addition to this, there are also apps that I wish Sony would make downloadable if needed, but removable if not needed. Apps such as XPERIA Lounge and Playstation Video are useless for me since I don’t have a Playstation and other such as Sketch and AR effect are fun, but ultimately just gimmicks. There are also a few small apps that can be used while using another app, for example the browser, a timer, and a calculator. There are also some small apps that can be downloaded from the Play Store, but you still can’t use any apps. Everything else works similarly to stock Android, with performance being much better if there hadn’t added some annoying bloatware to the mix. The good news is that Sony promises an update to 6.0 Marshmallow for 2016, so that is a positive note. Sony did a good job, but I can’t help but wonder it if could’ve been better.-Waterproofing and Extra Notes-Now, on to this phone’s highlighted feature: the water resistance. Just a little bit of information that you should know: Sony never directly states that it is completely waterproof. They even advise against putting it completely underwater. Nevertheless, it is good on its promise of being water resistant. Placing it underwater for 20 minutes completely submerged didn’t harm it and listening to music in the shower worked great. I wouldn’t recommend doing it constantly, but it does give reassurance that water will not kill it. Something I do want to note is that this phone heats up rapidly even when just going through simple web browsing. Also, the battery does not give 2 days of battery life. The power saving modes do help with battery life, but the most I’ve gotten in general use is one day with 4 hours of screen on time. It is good, but nowhere near the 2 hours it claims.-Conclusion-Here is where I have trouble with this phone. Independently, it is a really good phone with good performance for what it is in addition to a beautiful design and waterproofing that gives users the confidence to have it in the rain. However, there is currently a lot of competition that makes it hard to recommend this phone. For starters, if you want the best bang for your buck, there is the Blu Life One X with a better screen and similar design for less money at $149. If you want a compact phone, there is the Alcatel Idol 3 4.7 at $179 which is still a good phone that is lighter. If you want the looks of the M4, what’s wrong with the OnePlus X, which has a much better screen, much more power, and looks almost the same at a slightly higher price of $249? Honestly, any of the above options are great and they are cheaper than the M4. If you really need the waterproofing, then this is one of your cheaper options and definitely the one to get. But for everyone else, the other options would probably be better."

It does not automatically connect to known WiFi connections and there are audio issues where it has difficult switching between headphones, to Bluetooth to normal use. Each time this happens a factory reset appears to correct the issue, but clearly that is inconvenient."

"390458","Sony Xperia M4 Aqua 16GB GSM/LTE Unlocked Cell Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",5,"All I can say is WOW! This is a great phone, I don't know about the comments regarding the camera quality, it blows my S5 and Nexus 5x away. Have not had any over heating issues either but I'm not running a bunch of apps at the same time. Works great on Tmobile network. Wait for it to go on sale and for the price it can't be beat."

"390461","Sony Xperia M4 Aqua 16GB GSM/LTE Unlocked Cell Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",5,"I'm an Iphone user who purchased and set this up for my mother in law. I have used android tablets, so I have a general familiarity with them. I was impressed with this phone, which has a nice screen and everything functions quickly. I was also impressed with the versatility/configurability of android, as this was my first real time spent setting it up. For the money (I got it on a flash deal for $149) I don't think you can beat this device.UPDATE: 3/20/2016For those who've suffered heat or battery life issues, or the ""sleep of death"", I also had this problem, which is highly frustrating. However, these issues resolved for me by using the Sony PC companion software. You have to connect the phone to the computer and in the PC Companion, press start under Support Zone > Start under update phone software > repair phone. Then follow the on screen instructions in the program. Since I did this (a month ago) I've had no further problems and it's been a fantastic phone."

"390463","Sony Xperia M4 Aqua 16GB GSM/LTE Unlocked Cell Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",5,"I have an LG G3 in RMA. It just resets on its own. I needed a spare phone and was considering a BLU phone until I found this at 50% off the MSRP. This was a lucky impulse buy which I got at the right time.The phone was the E2306. This thing has T-Mobile's HSPA+ (3G) 1700 MHz frequency (not common) for unlocked phones. It also has LTE bands 2,4,5,12,17 which are the majority of T-Mobile and AT&T frequencies.The phone is pretty slick. I love the aesthetics. It feels dense though. I fear if I drop it, it will break.I had a Nexus 5 (32GB) and LG G3 (32GB) before this phone. So I will use them as references.First item to compare… the screen size and resolution. This phone has the smallest size of the 3 and the smallest resolution of 1280 x 720 (HD). Nexus 5 was a Full HD phone and the LG G3 is a Quad HD. I do not feel that I am missing anything with the lower resolution. How small do you need your text? Everything appears to be crystal clear.Next is the RAM… This has 2GB to match the Nexus 5, and 1GB less than the LG G3. I did not see this phone slow down. I have not been playing any games. I have not been using it at its fullest limit.Next is the storage… this phone has the smallest of the 3 phones with 16 GB. So, this will limit the number of apps you can use and install. I saw this limit on a Samsung tablet and I believe this is the greatest detractor. Now, this also has an MicroSD slot. This is something that the Nexus 5 does not have. So potentially, you can store more pictures and music in this device. The LG G3 wins hands down with 32GB internal with MicroSD card expansion slot. As a spare phone, this Xperia M4 is perfect for me. This could be my daily driver if my LG G3 cannot be repaired. (I no longer have the Nexus 5).NFC… all the phones have NFC, and Bluetooth, Wi-Fi wireless N also included.Battery… the battery is not user replaceable. This was the flaw with my Nexus 5 and why it needed to be replaced. The LG G3 wins this factor with a replaceable battery.Processor speed… This is the slowest on paper but it is future proofed with a 64-bit processor. Although it is an Octo (8) core, it is more like 2 quad cores switching between the two. I do not think I am missing the power. It is still as smooth as the other phones.Speaker… The Nexus 5 and this phone has roughly the same location. The LG G3 speaker is on the back. Of the 3 phones mentioned, this has the BEST SPEAKER phone volume and SPEAKER for music.Camera… This has a 13 MP camera. IT IS THE BEST CAMERA OF ALL 3 PHONES NOTED. I have not taken a blurry picture with this phone. It is slower than the LG G3 and about the same speed as the Nexus 5 in taking pictures, but it is worth it for the quality.Waterproof… need I say more. The LG G3 and the Nexus 5 are not. So, I can put this under the sink faucet and wash my phone. This is probably a major reason that the battery is not user replaceable.Other items to note:1. This phone uses a Nano-SIM. This is the smallest of the 3 phone SIM card form factors.2. The native messaging app stinks! Sony dropped the ball on how it handles group SMS/MMS and organizing the received messages on the group. Sony splits ALL the received messages and sending a group MMS requires a subject. Unfortunately, all the replies are still on separate strings. Get another app, like Google Messenger, Textra, Evolve SMS, etc. With all the benefits of this phone, I could not rate this phone below a five star."
"390464","Sony Xperia M4 Aqua 16GB GSM/LTE Unlocked Cell Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",5,"I am very satisfied, I exceeded my expectations, excellent cost-benefit."
"390465","Sony Xperia M4 Aqua 16GB GSM/LTE Unlocked Cell Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",3,"phone is great except that the camera doesn't work with several third party apps. Of course, neither Sony nor the app developers have been helpful. I suspect it has to do with support for the specific camera hardware, and I don't expect it to be resolved anytime soon. otherwise a great Android phone."
"390466","Sony Xperia M4 Aqua 16GB GSM/LTE Unlocked Cell Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",3,"The first time I put the phone under water the microphone stopped working on calls. I disabled the secondary mic that is for noise suppression and now the main mic seems to be working on calls but the quality is poor. This is a disappointment for a phone with ""aqua"" in the name. The battery life is terrible. It often lasts less than 12 hours. Sony customer support was worthless as usual. Now I have to send it in and be without a phone for 2 weeks. But seriously, it's a $200 phone, so what do you expect."
"390467","Sony Xperia M4 Aqua 16GB GSM/LTE Unlocked Cell Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",3,"It get's hot easily not like red hot but is uncomfortable also poor camera quality"
"390468","Sony Xperia M4 Aqua 16GB GSM/LTE Unlocked Cell Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",3,"I purchased this phone when the price first dropped to $200 on Black Friday. I figured this would be an upgrade to my damaged Nexus 4, rather than repairing it. The great part of this phone is that it had more RAM, drive space and a seemingly faster processor. Plus that fact that I could add an SD card and was waterproof was a bonus.Upon use I immediately noticed that the octa-core processor would heat up the phone very easily, to the point that it would be hot to touch. I use this for everything, from setting appointments, sharing files across apps, playing Candy Crush, running with RunKeeper and playing music, using Waze/Google Maps and posting on Facebook. It acts fine with using one app at a time, but crashes, overheats and slows down completely when multitasking. This is VERY frustrating when I'm trying to make a call or quickly set up directions for navigation.On the plus side, I am happy that it is waterproof. I went running last month, and during the last quarter-mile, I got stuck in a rain storm. Did not affect the device at all.Beside the fact that it has more storage that is also expandable, my Nexus 4 with less cores and less memory easily out-performs this phone. Hopefully the Z-series of this phone is much faster, else I may have to get the more expensive Samsung S series phones to solve my frustrations."
"390469","Sony Xperia M4 Aqua 16GB GSM/LTE Unlocked Cell Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",5,"I bought this phone in Aug of 2015 and I still love it. It has everything that I need and want with a phone. It takes decent photos, and is just the right size for me. I did almost run out of space on it once but the problem was easily resolved by uploading all of my pictures to google drive and then deleting them from my phone. As mentioned by some other reviewers it does heat up sometimes but this is rare and has never been a real problem. The battery life is good, for me itusually last a couple days unless I am constantly using my phone. I did take some pictures with it while standing in a creek where the phone was exposed to some water, not completely immersed, and it was fine. The phone looks really nice and sleek and like I said is the perfect size for me I am 5'4"" and I don't like the huge phones. At the same time the screen seems really big when I am watching something on the phone. I have had the phone almost a year and have had no hardware or software problems. I am so happy I found and bought this cell phone it has definitely met and exceeded my expectations and I only paid a little over 200 dollars for it. I will probably replace it when it is really outdated but it will be hard to part with! I definitely recommend this phone if you are an android person."

Its not a bad phone for 200 bucks but the more I use it the more I wish I just lived without a phone for a bit longer and bought something better."

I'm not a power user by no means I only play a couple of games that my Moto G can handle well and Internet browsing but this phone would constantly close my apps without an error and delete all the progress I had done with it. Not to mention using it in the lowest screen light would still make the phone so hot it would hurt to hold, and even iny pocket without use it would do it. Never had a defective Sony phone before and I got this brand new I honestly think thats just how it was supposed to work, which didn't work for me. I guess if you want a reliable phone and don't use apps or the Internet a lot I would recommend it."

The touch response is great, the resolution is great, the camera isn't bad if you manually adjust it, but the shutter is slow and having to change the settings often could be a drag. The only thing that scared me is that I've felt a couple momentary lags and it's the first day, but I was installing a bunch of apps, so we'll see. It's just my opinion, but I like the UI. I really hope I can enable voice to text. I bought the phone at $200,so it was definitely worth the price. The port covers are awesome, much better than those on the first z.

"390502","Sony Xperia M4 Aqua 16GB GSM/LTE Unlocked Cell Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",1,"So after long deliberation about my first smartphone, I chose the Sony Xperia M4 Aqua. I have had Sony Ericsson phones before that were very sturdy so I was hoping for something similar. My husband trusted my judgement, and also needed a new phone, so we ended up ordering two. We've had them for seven weeks now;Frankly, I am very disappointed. If I have one word to describe this phone, it would be: slow. I did not install that much apps or anything, but when switching on the phone, it just takes a long time. Also, when opening social media apps like whatsapp or facebook, it just keeps switching off and on while you are typing, extremely annoying. Taking a picture of something that is not a still object, is practically impossible. It takes 3-4 sec to take the shot, which is a very very long time. So you end up always missing that one moment. And when you take the picture, after a few seconds you see a frame being 'saved' but this is not the picture you end up with. So blurry pictures are now a big part of my library, unfortunately.Even worse with the video recording - without any sign that something is wrong, they can end up completely black. I was taping two of our friends saying 'I do' at their wedding, and afterwards it turned out there was absolutely nothing on the tape (you did see that something was taped though, and I could 'play' it, but as said, it is completely black). Next video I tried turned out fine - no idea why. But again, I missed the big moment because of the phone.When someone calls and you just touch the screen somewhere to pick up the phone, you are disconnected most of the times.My husband's phone stopped working after five weeks of light use - microphone did not work in 4 out of 5 times. He had to ship it to be looked at and has to miss his phone 15 business days without any replacement. This is completely unacceptable for a brand new phone! He should just get a new one, if you ask me.Also, be careful when placing the phone in your pocket, because the back tends to become really, really hot- almost too hot to touch at one point. Can not be healthy to walk around with, close to your body.And the last thing I do not like is the fact that it is too big for my hands, but that's just because I have rather small hands.What do I like -- I like the design- I like the fact that it's water proof, however did not put this to the test yet- I like the the ringtones- I definitely like the battery life (two days easily), takes at least 6 hours to recharge though.But I would not recommend it to anyone.UPDATE: in looking for a solution for the videos always turning out black - I found that this is an issue that is often reported and well know to Sony. Their only solution is to restart the phone. Then 1 or 2 videos can turn out OK."

After a few months of using the phone, the ear piece in the phone stopped working, I called sony and explained the problem, it still worked on speaker, and with the handsfree set in, but not when holding the earpiece to my ear. They insisted it could be a software glitch and had me reset the phone..... twice, which did not work.So I had to send it in for repair, and this is where the fun starts. Having been told it would take about 14 business days to fix and send my phone back, I am currently still waiting and we are on business day 28. To this point, after 4 phone calls, and 3 emails (because one representative actually told me that they didn't have a way to call people at the facility where the repairs take place, true story!), still no-one can tell me when the phone might be fixed.With that in mind, I asked for a replacement phone the last time I contacted them, I felt that was not unreasonable as they were well past their own schedule for repairing and returning my device, and clearly could not give any clue as to when it might be done. They simply ignored that request and said that my phone would be repaired and sent back when they got the parts in. This could be in 6 days, or 6 months.I would not by this product and would recommend people avoid sony products if this is what happens when the slightest thing goes wrong. The support (or lack thereof) is appalling for a company of their size and standing, and it could be a simple fix, if they would just replace a device when they are having so much trouble finding the part they need for it. Instead they are leaving a paying customer hanging, with no recourse, and without the phone paid for."
"390523","Sony Xperia M4 Aqua 16GB GSM/LTE Unlocked Cell Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",1,"I bought this one. However It was not work. So, I returned this item, however my credit card was charged again by seller's mistake. DO NOT BUY THIS s***"
"390524","Sony Xperia M4 Aqua 16GB GSM/LTE Unlocked Cell Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",4,"I got this on a lightening deal for $200 bucks. However, I want to address some claims. Unless you are a very light user you will not get two days off a charge. If you are a heavy user, you might not get one day. I'm a moderate user and typically end the day in the 20%'s, which is good compared to my old iPhone. In spite of reviews, games with a lot of graphics do not play well with this phone, a lot of lag. Angry Birds, Minion Rush, laggy. Camera is a big disappointment, slow to turn on and slow shutter response. Quality is ok, you just never know when you're going to get the picture taken. Other apps all work well without lag. I really like the thinness of the phone and the 5"" screen. Audio connected thought Bluetooth is loud. Call quality is ok. Works great with Android Pay."

I have had the phone for about 2 months.I'll get to the two things I don't like1) No Wireless charging... can't really complain but the flagship phones have it. For the price this is no big deal but I miss it.2) Camera is ok. Its not great. If you buy a phone for casual photos you'll be fine... if the camera is biggest deal ever for you then you may be disappointed."
"390529","Sony Xperia M4 Aqua 16GB GSM/LTE Unlocked Cell Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",5,"This is a sweet phone. They make the phone look really classy like Sonys higher end models. The insides are quality components that should perform better, but comparison tests show that it is a bit slower than similar hardware. Attribute that to the 'pretty'sony software/theme. Testers go out of their way to really torture this phone on youtube (see xperia m4 aqua nutella, knife, waterproof) and this ip68 rated phone does really well. I love this phone and am considering their tablet now. Water And dust proof, beautiful design, memory slot. What more to ask for? Laugh at those fools that spend nearly a grand on these 'smart phones', and then end up getting it wet or shattering it. No nense in spending that especially when you will replace them in a year or two. Thats just being a dumb user and giving money away to the company so the can build a spaceship campus. Battery life is impressive: with everything on (broadband data, wifi, bluetooth) and normal use (texting, phone, some surfing) it can go 3.5 to 4 days between full charge. The full charging itself is very fast, i say under 2hrs. This is all without Sonys battery saving modes! I'm testing the two battery saving modes now. Incredible phone, and looks very nice. Buy this phone for 2-3 hundred, spend another 15 on nice rubber case and glass screen protector. This phone looks and feels amazing in its protection, not clumsy and goofy like those samsungs and apples. Yes, get this phone and you will have a smart phone with a smart user, instead of blowing a grand on some ARM PoS that can barely compute."

Tried hard resetting the phone, upgrading the software to Android 6.0.1, but the problem could not be resolved.Contacted Sony support and after plugging in the IMEI their website says my phone was not under warranty, even though it was within a year of my purchase date from Amazon.Also had regular problems with SMS messages on this phone - messages received from people would periodically be in all Chinese characters (copied and pasted to Google Translate and the translation made absolutely no sense). I also had quite an unreliable time receiving MMS group text messages, with some responses not being received, or in the incorrect order. This is after consulting with the AT&T website and confirming that I had the correct APN settings entered.I tried the default Sony messaging app, Google Messenger, Google Hangouts, Textra, and other SMS/MMS apps, with no success.I have thrown in the towel on this phone, especially after the manufacturer refused to honor the 1-year warranty (as advertised in the product description)."

"390546","Sony Xperia M4 Aqua 16GB GSM/LTE Unlocked Cell Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",5,"Bought cause my Z1s was damaged beyond repair and I've only had this one a few days. So far it has been great however I'm not a heavy user of apps and games. I'm hoping the heating and locking and slowing down problems I've read about are simply due to the early lolipop upgrades which nearly bricked my Z1s when it first came out, it was aweful, but after a long while and updates it finally started running smoother and cooler. I really like not having to pull a clip/door open and close every time I want to charge this one. The headphone plug doesn't seem quite as sturdy but if it works it works, the sound with my sony earbuds (the best earbuds for price too) is louder and seems to sound better on the M4 Aqua which is also good. I keep wifi and bluetooth turned off and it seems like it will last about the same maybe a little bit longer on average but not much, maybe could push 3 to 4 days with little to no use during that time, estimating 8 to 24 hours on a heavy day. Direct charging speed from wallwart usb seems pretty fast to me, still slow if usb from my laptop. Over all there are subtle differences, but nothing really bad or nor great, I love the sleek flat design of xperias, abd tho I know support kind of sucks, I'll keep my fingers crossed, I'll remain a Sony fan."

There were a very few curiosity when I got this phone, but I understood since the phone came from an international stock:1. Immediate Language Startup: when turning on the phone, the language selector never asked ""which language you would prefer"" or something similar like that.2. Foreign Apps: I saw there was some foreign apps that would normally never come in a Sony phone. Luckily, it can be uninstalled but that sense really made me weirded me out.Overall: Despite the 2 curiosity I noticed on the phone and realized its from international stock: Fantastic!"

I ordered a BLACK phone but instead got a WHITE phone. The product itself is good, but for a company to make a mistake like this is just plain scary. Main reason for purchasing is for the dual sims and i am loving that so far. Device quickly was updated to 5.0. It runs well but gets hot at some weird times. I dont mean warm, i mean you cant miss the fact that it is hot. I have had two instances when i look at it and it is off. These have been registered as ""System incidents"". Was reading up on these incidents and i am a bit concerned. These situations are different from from restarts that i have triggered be squeezing the door outside the dual sim area. I assume that when i squeeze there, i move the sim underneath and this triggers a restart. I can live with that because my sims were cut. Screen is lovely, its loud enough so i dont miss calls, camera is good, it switches between apps effortlessly and well, its a good phone.....so far."

"390596","Sony Xperia M4 Aqua E2363 Dual SIM 5.0-Inch Factory Unlocked Smartphone (Black) - International Stock No Warranty",5,"I bought this phone from Marketplace seller ""Gotham's Cells."" It's the model destined for Taiwan, so the phone out of the box was configured in Chinese. You have to go into Settings to change the language to, say, English. Unfortunately Android is a pain to use, and each version sports a very different UI. This one runs Android 5.I got the phone primarily as a sync device for my beloved Sony a6000 camera. Secondarily, I use it as a backup phone to my iPhone. Android is very hard to use and configure, but this is one of the best Android 5 phones I've tried. It runs fast and is very responsive. Sometimes Google's Play Store is really slow but I know it's Google's fault, not the phone's, because I'd be on the same WiFi network and in the same WiFi range, and the Firefox browser runs fast all the time.If you have a Sony mirrorless camera like the alpha series, you need to download two apps from the Play Store: PlayMemories Mobile for downloading photos and videos from the camera, and (optionally) PlayMemories Online to upload the images to Sony's cloud drive (5GB for free). Of course you can forego the latter and sync the photos from the phone to your computer; I use a Mac utility Sony provides in addition to auto-syncing to PlayMemories Online (cloud storage). I'd have preferred a way to sync to iCloud but so far I haven't found a trustworthy way. Android is full of spyware and trojans and viruses, and everybody says Google spies on its users, which worries me.Within the confines of being an Android phone, this is an excellent smartphone. I recommend it."

It has very good design, hardware, performance, storage, and battery. It's simple with power with no disappointment. There were a very few curiosity when I got this phone, but I understood since the phone came from an international stock:1. Immediate Language Startup: when turning on the phone, the language selector never asked ""which language you would prefer"" or something similar like that.2. Foreign Apps: I saw there was some foreign apps that would normally never come in a Sony phone. Luckily, it can be uninstalled but that sense really made me weirded me out.Overall: Despite the 2 curiosity I noticed on the phone and realized its from international stock: Fantastic!"
"390693","Sony Xperia M4 Aqua E2363 Dual SIM 5.0-Inch Factory Unlocked Smartphone (White) - International Stock No Warranty",4,"The phone is just as described. Looks sleek and all. I bought this phone 3 weeks ago, and after 2 weeks i got some glitches , wouldnt read my sim card out of nowherr, and the battery drained really quickly. Just from one day to the next. I contacted customer service and they sent me a new one right away. The service was great. I ended up putting a factory reset on the first phone and now it seems to work just fine. Im sending back the first one and continuing with the second one they sent me. I really like the phone. Works great. I think it was that particular one that went a bit mad. Anyways. Will update with the new one in a month or two.Update:6 months later and the camera quit working. I've tried everything. Im dissapointed. A camera is a must have for me on a phone. Im purchasing a new phone, but it won't be a sony. Had too many issues with one phone within 6 months."

"390708","Sony Xperia M4 Aqua E2363 Dual SIM 5.0-Inch Factory Unlocked Smartphone (White) - International Stock No Warranty",3,"The basics of purchasing something is getting what you ask for. I ordered a BLACK phone but instead got a WHITE phone. The product itself is good, but for a company to make a mistake like this is just plain scary. Main reason for purchasing is for the dual sims and i am loving that so far. Device quickly was updated to 5.0. It runs well but gets hot at some weird times. I dont mean warm, i mean you cant miss the fact that it is hot. I have had two instances when i look at it and it is off. These have been registered as ""System incidents"". Was reading up on these incidents and i am a bit concerned. These situations are different from from restarts that i have triggered be squeezing the door outside the dual sim area. I assume that when i squeeze there, i move the sim underneath and this triggers a restart. I can live with that because my sims were cut. Screen is lovely, its loud enough so i dont miss calls, camera is good, it switches between apps effortlessly and well, its a good phone.....so far."

Just got covered by an piece of material like once could be called a box. Was a miracle that nothing got damaged or lost.Otherwise everything so far so good"
"390715","Sony Xperia M4 Aqua E2363 Dual SIM 5.0-Inch Factory Unlocked Smartphone (White) - International Stock No Warranty",5,"I bought this phone from Marketplace seller ""Gotham's Cells."" It's the model destined for Taiwan, so the phone out of the box was configured in Chinese. You have to go into Settings to change the language to, say, English. Unfortunately Android is a pain to use, and each version sports a very different UI. This one runs Android 5.I got the phone primarily as a sync device for my beloved Sony a6000 camera. Secondarily, I use it as a backup phone to my iPhone. Android is very hard to use and configure, but this is one of the best Android 5 phones I've tried. It runs fast and is very responsive. Sometimes Google's Play Store is really slow but I know it's Google's fault, not the phone's, because I'd be on the same WiFi network and in the same WiFi range, and the Firefox browser runs fast all the time.If you have a Sony mirrorless camera like the alpha series, you need to download two apps from the Play Store: PlayMemories Mobile for downloading photos and videos from the camera, and (optionally) PlayMemories Online to upload the images to Sony's cloud drive (5GB for free). Of course you can forego the latter and sync the photos from the phone to your computer; I use a Mac utility Sony provides in addition to auto-syncing to PlayMemories Online (cloud storage). I'd have preferred a way to sync to iCloud but so far I haven't found a trustworthy way. Android is full of spyware and trojans and viruses, and everybody says Google spies on its users, which worries me.Within the confines of being an Android phone, this is an excellent smartphone. I recommend it."

The phone has fallen a couple of times over the 5 months period, but not recently. Same thing happened with my Sony Xperia Z1. Maybe it's the glass Sony uses? I would not recommend anyone buy this phone. Sending text messages is frustrating, you will miss photo opportunities waiting for the camera to work, and you will miss appointments if you rely on the alarm and the battery drains down mysteriously and the phone turns off.Pros:- Battery life- Picture quality- Water proof (although one time when the phone got wet, it didn't function properly for a short while.Cons:- Cracked screen, maybe my fault, maybe the glass Sony uses is defective since this is my 2nd Sony phone with the same problem- Slow camera, takes several seconds to take a picture so sometimes you will miss a good photo opportunity- Text messages take up to 30 seconds to send out- Battery was drained over night from almost full to zero three times over the last 7 months.I mainly bought this phone because it has dual sim capability and it is water proof. Other than those features, the phone is not very special and I will most likely buy a different brand next time.UPDATE August 1, 2016The phone started acting up after I inserted the second SIM card. It was turning off and on several times a day. Now the phone is not turning on anymore. After 8 months of use RIP Sony Xperia M5. Tomorrow I will be purchasing a Samsung."

I can't send multimedia. I can only send it through email.I can post pics on Facebook with the onboard features that is on the phone but if I want to send pics or vids to family and friends I can only do it through emails.I recently found out my provider doesn't guarantee everything will work with unlocked phones and downloads was one of them.I can get pics fine from friends.

At home I have a Verizon Galaxy 3, and this is no Galaxy 3, but Verizon is INSANE in their oversea charges. Before my next trip I will get rid of Verizon (once my contract runs out) and change to Tmobile so I can get a good GSM phone and take advantage of Tmobile's new travel policy where foreign calls, texts and data are included. Still, this phone was OK and did the job for a cheap phone. I wouldn't want to use it every day as it is small and somewhat flimsy feeling. But for the price it was good and I liked it."

The phone is light and the screen size is perfect if you are not looking for a large screen like Samsung Note or Galaxy S3. The feel is pretty much like iPhone 4S, except that this is much lighter. The camera picture quality is also fair. The only problem that I had with this phone is that I had wi-fi problem from time to time. The phone had difficulty to reconnect to the wi-fi connections. Searching on the web and talking to a Sony customer service, I found out that this is a common problem with a few Sony cell phones recently and no one knows how to resolve it.

"390844","Sony Xperia Miro ST23A Unlocked Android Phone with 5 MP Camera and 3.5-Inch Screen--U.S. Warranty (Black/Pink)",3,"Well, as a long time die hard Nokia fan (Currently own a Nokia N8)I was looking for a pone that would me to experience Android but did not want an expensive (flagship) pone but neither wanted a Low end one. This pone fits that description. I have used a Galaxy Ace and found it lacking some stuff I really wanted (Front facing camera, decent rear camera and onboard storage)and I realized then that I don't like TouchWiz UI so Samsung is out of the question.This pone feels very good in the hand, has the right size as most pones nowadays are over 4 inches in size, and to me that's just too big (even though I have big hands)The downside for me is that the accessories are way too expensive for this pone and it does not came with a screen protector or a headset.I am still stumbling on some of it's features and on Android as a whole, as I am just learning the howto's of Android.I am still looking for a substitute to my two years old N8, but untill I can find a pone with the same or better battery life (3 days with wifi on 24 hours) and a better camera, and a matching signal coverage and call quality, the N8 is staying with me.Overall I am lovind thei pone so far, it just scared me a bit one time when, after playing with the settings, the screen would not turn on when the charger was unplugged, I could hear the pone unlocking click but could not see nothing on the screen. After re-connecting the charger, the screen came back on, so I increased the screen brightness a bit and the issue went away (same thing happenned to me once with an Asus netbook).Nice Little pone, really recommended for anyone who does not want a high end android but a good mid range one. Ohh, and it comes with ICS out of the box (unlike the Galaxy Ace, and I do't think it will ever be updated to ICS)***UPDATE Jan 16 2013***Minus 2 starts as the phone is now going to a repair shop.It has developped a really annoying ""feature"" where if the phone is charged using the supplied charger, it would get hot and after the screen turns off it will not come back on after the charge is completed. The phone will continue to work, as I will hear it unlock, receive calls and notifications also but I can't see a thing as the screen is completely black.It would normally ""wake up"" randomly after a couple minutes or hours and continue to work fine untill the next charge.I then avoided charging it with the supplied charger and used the computer instead as when I did so, it would not get hot and all will work fine after the charge is completed.Well, 3 days ago I charged the phone with the computer and the screen turned off, as it normally does, after the charge was completed it worked fine so I went outside. When I tried to use the phone the screen would not come back on. I can hear the phone doing the ""click"" when I unlock it, I can receive calls, but the screen is completely black.3 days now and the screen is still pitch black so the phone is going to a repair shop so they can determine what is the problem with it.As I am no longer in the US I cannot return it as the fee is very high to ship a package to the US and back, so it's going to have to go to a local repair shop.I was so happy with the phone untill this.I must have got a lemmon."
"390845","Sony Xperia Miro ST23A Unlocked Android Phone with 5 MP Camera and 3.5-Inch Screen--U.S. Warranty (Black/Pink)",5,"Intro: Having passed through a few reasonably priced, decently powered Xperia handsets (my last was a Xperia Mini) I am now on to my latest, the Sony Xperia Miro ST23a. This purchase was influenced by a couple of factors such as the availability of handsets at the time, the features (I missed the front camera in my old Xperia Mini Pro) and a simple design. I tend to stick to mid-range Android handsets because technology changes everyday and it makes no sense buying expensive, high end devices when the next best thing is right around the corner. However, this is subject to debate because we'll agree that everyone has different needs and tastes where mobile handsets are concerned.Features: I'll just highlight a few of the main features below since the full specifications can be found by searching for the Sony Xperia Miro at cc[...]:- Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich Operating System (latest handset build is 11.0.A.5.5 which seems to speed up functionality and add the SMS counter)- Quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE support as well as dual-band UMTS support- 3.5"" 320 x 480 pixel touch-screen with HVGA resolution- 800MHz Cortex-A5 Processor- 5MP rear camera with auto-focus and LED flash- VGA front camera for Googletalk, Oovoo and Skype calls- MicroSD card slot (internal) with support for up to a 32GB card- 4GB internal memory and 512MB RAM- Wi-Fi b/g/n, Wi-Fi hot-spot support- Stereo FM radio and much moreOpinion: The Sony Xperia Miro satisfies my needs for a smartphone at the moment, however I haven't fully explored its capabilities or features as yet. The camera quality is crisp and clear when taking pictures and the interface is far smoother than the update I performed on my previous Xperia Mini Pro and Xperia Mini handsets. It is a reasonably priced handset (I got mines at the time for US$202.26) which provides the standard features you'll come to expect from a Sony Xperia handset. I did not receive a headset with my purchase but I was able to source one via Amazon. For others who may need to purchase a headset, please be advised that you cannot use previous Sony Ericsson headsets with the newer Sony Xperia handsets. According to a post by another user (see the customer review here[...] ) older Sony Ericsson Xperia headsets use the OMTP standard which is not compatible with newer Sony Xperia handsets."

(due to the fact that this is not a true Android phone but rather an ""overlay""or something like that) not all apps work reliably (snapchat videos wouldn't always play, i experienced lag many times, apps would shut off) and something that was built-in, the camera, stopped working reliably, making me miss out on many photo opportunities. I decided i no longer wanted a phone that made me wonder every time i turned it on if something was going to work.aside from things like that, the phone is beautiful, compact, and lightweight. i would have kept it if the operating system was more reliable."

"390864","Sony Xperia Miro ST23A Unlocked Android Phone with 5 MP Camera and 3.5-Inch Screen--U.S. Warranty (Black/Pink)",5,"My original T-Mobile phone was supposed to be everything that this phone was, only it wasn't. For the same price I got an Android 2.3 Gingerbread with an Amoled touch screen, though it was pretty to look at the phone could not update and it caused me major grief when the SD card slot died and the phone slowed down after only a couple months of owning it. Instead of buying out of contract and adding more pain to my wallet I looked to Amazon, I had heard that Sony was starting to make amazing smartphones and found that an Android 4.0 ICS was available - I read many reviews against this and other Xperia types; there are more expensive ones out there that only run 2.3 - I wondered how and why this was, as this phone is a good deal $200.00 less than those. After thinking really hard, I bought it - two days later I was able to play with it, though the screen is not an Amoled and doesn't look the greatest - I got used to it in a matter of hours, this phone is seriously fast when you want an app open it doesn't fumble the screen around flickering trying to operate - it just opens quickly and smoothly. It has built in Walkman technology only the best of what you would imagine from Sony with level adjustments and equalizers built in with no added app or cost to get it, unlike my old phone where I had to buy a $2.00 app to get the same basic functionality. The downside is Sony's Timescape which has not had an update in months so getting the live Social Media Updates right from the homescreen gives an error, from the looks of it, even the new Sony Xperia series still have this problem and Sony may never fix it, but I took it off the homescreen and that took care of that. It has a changing color theme light which is very cool and changes from blue for facebook or text message updates or red if you get google updates and it looks extremely sleek and futuristic which is everything I have wanted in a phone. It's the greatest purchase I have have ever made for myself on such a small device.The camera is a true 5.0mp camera and takes very clean photos and it takes them quickly, the video is a bit different - the quality is brought down quite a bit. The microphone on this is the clearest I've heard on a mid level phone as well as the speaker on the back - Sony knows sound and they do it really well.The phone is very lightweight, to the point that I thought that there was nothing inside of it at first.After using it for a couple weeks it's showing me there is something in there and it's doing a fantastic job.Sony used to leave a very bitter taste in my mouth - from TV's catching on fire, to sparking Vaio batteries... I used to be an Apple only kind of person, but my family introduced me to Android and Google - which I thought was best with Samsung, I no longer feel that way. I feel Sony has started to become an electronics giant again and I am excited to see what they will bring in the future."
"390865","Sony Xperia Miro ST23A Unlocked Android Phone with 5 MP Camera and 3.5-Inch Screen--U.S. Warranty (Black/Pink)",4,"Update: T-Mobile sucks!Returning this phone. T-Mobile claims it is not compatible with their network - possible since it does not have the 1700 mhz band supposedly - yet I had been getting 3g for two days - all of a sudden - only edge. Oh well. If they are going to play games with teh bands on the phones I will continue to avoid their overpriced in store phones and will have to seek out a 1700 mhz phone until my contract is up with them.Wow. So far i really like this phone. Old phone was a Samsung galaxy S. It was getting old and had no internal memory - and as you know, not all apps can be moved to the SD card so I was constantly getting the ""low memory issues. This one seems to have enough internal to handle whatever cannot be moved to SD (time will tell.) But I really like the feel of this phone. Feels sturdy in the hand. A bit smaller than the Galaxy but has a more solid feel to it. In portrait that smaller size does make for typing issues but I find the microphone very accurate and use it most of the time to type. Battery life so far seems very good as well. I leave the Bluetooth on all the time and used WIFI on and off throughout the day and it doesn't seem to drain. (I tend to keep my phone plugged in anyway so it wouldn't be an issue at home. Also, it has a removable battery - for me this is a HUGE advantage as I can buy a spare for traveling or really long days and just swap out the battery.I have used SPB Shell on the Galaxy but it slowed it down too much. Loaded on this and ran great. But the Sony interface is so nice, I switched back to that.The only two quibbles so far are the size (keyboard) and the loudness of the speaker phone (too quiet) but I use Bluetooth most of the time so not an issue.Worked out of the box - threw in SIM card and memory card and off it went.So far, so good."
"390866","Sony Xperia Miro ST23A Unlocked Android Phone with 5 MP Camera and 3.5-Inch Screen--U.S. Warranty (White)",1,"I bought the phone almost 1 year now, and it appeared to be okay. It wasn't 1 month after when the phone started giving problems. The phone drops almost all of my calls, you would be in the middle of a conversation and the phone would just shut down and sometimes takes forever to come back on. The phone freezes almost every 10 minutes and the camera is horrible. so to sum it up i would not recommend this phone to anyone to anyone who is looking to have a sensible Android phone"

"390868","Sony Xperia Miro ST23A Unlocked Android Phone with 5 MP Camera and 3.5-Inch Screen--U.S. Warranty (White)",5,"The phone looks great with the notification lights. The phone is also very light! I loved the phone because it has received great signal. The phone is good for browsing the web, gaming, and texting your friends! But, when the phone's memory goes over 50%, the phone starts to slow down and starts to also lag. But, good thing that the phone has expandable storage because you can go to the store, buy a Micro SD Card, and put the card into the phone to expand the storage! Doing that avoids the phone slowing down and the phone lagging!"

Pics are decent.I like to multi task and I can do it with ease. I wish it had more memory space. Couldn't move any games to the sd card. The only directions that came with it was showing where the earpiece and etc.No manual. This is the first Sony phone that I bought that was like this. Their online manual was no help. I can't send multimedia. I can only send it through email.I can post pics on Facebook with the onboard features that is on the phone but if I want to send pics or vids to family and friends I can only do it through emails.I recently found out my provider doesn't guarantee everything will work with unlocked phones and downloads was one of them.I can get pics fine from friends. It is best to find out what services your service provider will and will not offer on your phone."
"390873","Sony Xperia Miro ST23A Unlocked Android Phone with 5 MP Camera and 3.5-Inch Screen--U.S. Warranty (White)",4,"I like it for the price. I bought this unlocked GSM phone for a recent trip to Europe so I could get a local SIM card there. It served my needs. At home I have a Verizon Galaxy 3, and this is no Galaxy 3, but Verizon is INSANE in their oversea charges. Before my next trip I will get rid of Verizon (once my contract runs out) and change to Tmobile so I can get a good GSM phone and take advantage of Tmobile's new travel policy where foreign calls, texts and data are included. Still, this phone was OK and did the job for a cheap phone. I wouldn't want to use it every day as it is small and somewhat flimsy feeling. But for the price it was good and I liked it."

"390877","Sony Xperia Miro ST23A Unlocked Android Phone with 5 MP Camera and 3.5-Inch Screen--U.S. Warranty (White)",4,"This is a great design Android 4.0.1 based cell phone. Compare it with a Samsung Android based phone this phone looks much better from design point of view and is much less expensive than a similar Samsung or HTC cell phone. The phone is light and the screen size is perfect if you are not looking for a large screen like Samsung Note or Galaxy S3. The feel is pretty much like iPhone 4S, except that this is much lighter. The camera picture quality is also fair. The only problem that I had with this phone is that I had wi-fi problem from time to time. The phone had difficulty to reconnect to the wi-fi connections. Searching on the web and talking to a Sony customer service, I found out that this is a common problem with a few Sony cell phones recently and no one knows how to resolve it. So in spite of the fact that I was deeply in love with this phone I had to return it back!"

"390880","Sony Xperia Miro ST23A Unlocked Android Phone with 5 MP Camera and 3.5-Inch Screen--U.S. Warranty (White)",3,"Well, as a long time die hard Nokia fan (Currently own a Nokia N8)I was looking for a pone that would me to experience Android but did not want an expensive (flagship) pone but neither wanted a Low end one. This pone fits that description. I have used a Galaxy Ace and found it lacking some stuff I really wanted (Front facing camera, decent rear camera and onboard storage)and I realized then that I don't like TouchWiz UI so Samsung is out of the question.This pone feels very good in the hand, has the right size as most pones nowadays are over 4 inches in size, and to me that's just too big (even though I have big hands)The downside for me is that the accessories are way too expensive for this pone and it does not came with a screen protector or a headset.I am still stumbling on some of it's features and on Android as a whole, as I am just learning the howto's of Android.I am still looking for a substitute to my two years old N8, but untill I can find a pone with the same or better battery life (3 days with wifi on 24 hours) and a better camera, and a matching signal coverage and call quality, the N8 is staying with me.Overall I am lovind thei pone so far, it just scared me a bit one time when, after playing with the settings, the screen would not turn on when the charger was unplugged, I could hear the pone unlocking click but could not see nothing on the screen. After re-connecting the charger, the screen came back on, so I increased the screen brightness a bit and the issue went away (same thing happenned to me once with an Asus netbook).Nice Little pone, really recommended for anyone who does not want a high end android but a good mid range one. Ohh, and it comes with ICS out of the box (unlike the Galaxy Ace, and I do't think it will ever be updated to ICS)***UPDATE Jan 16 2013***Minus 2 starts as the phone is now going to a repair shop.It has developped a really annoying ""feature"" where if the phone is charged using the supplied charger, it would get hot and after the screen turns off it will not come back on after the charge is completed. The phone will continue to work, as I will hear it unlock, receive calls and notifications also but I can't see a thing as the screen is completely black.It would normally ""wake up"" randomly after a couple minutes or hours and continue to work fine untill the next charge.I then avoided charging it with the supplied charger and used the computer instead as when I did so, it would not get hot and all will work fine after the charge is completed.Well, 3 days ago I charged the phone with the computer and the screen turned off, as it normally does, after the charge was completed it worked fine so I went outside. When I tried to use the phone the screen would not come back on. I can hear the phone doing the ""click"" when I unlock it, I can receive calls, but the screen is completely black.3 days now and the screen is still pitch black so the phone is going to a repair shop so they can determine what is the problem with it.As I am no longer in the US I cannot return it as the fee is very high to ship a package to the US and back, so it's going to have to go to a local repair shop.I was so happy with the phone untill this.I must have got a lemmon."

It has a changing color theme light which is very cool and changes from blue for facebook or text message updates or red if you get google updates and it looks extremely sleek and futuristic which is everything I have wanted in a phone. It's the greatest purchase I have have ever made for myself on such a small device.The camera is a true 5.0mp camera and takes very clean photos and it takes them quickly, the video is a bit different - the quality is brought down quite a bit. The microphone on this is the clearest I've heard on a mid level phone as well as the speaker on the back - Sony knows sound and they do it really well.The phone is very lightweight, to the point that I thought that there was nothing inside of it at first.After using it for a couple weeks it's showing me there is something in there and it's doing a fantastic job.Sony used to leave a very bitter taste in my mouth - from TV's catching on fire, to sparking Vaio batteries... I used to be an Apple only kind of person, but my family introduced me to Android and Google - which I thought was best with Samsung, I no longer feel that way. I feel Sony has started to become an electronics giant again and I am excited to see what they will bring in the future."
"390891","Sony Xperia Miro ST23A Unlocked Android Phone with 5 MP Camera and 3.5-Inch Screen--U.S. Warranty (White)",4,"Update: T-Mobile sucks!Returning this phone. T-Mobile claims it is not compatible with their network - possible since it does not have the 1700 mhz band supposedly - yet I had been getting 3g for two days - all of a sudden - only edge. Oh well. If they are going to play games with teh bands on the phones I will continue to avoid their overpriced in store phones and will have to seek out a 1700 mhz phone until my contract is up with them.Wow. So far i really like this phone. Old phone was a Samsung galaxy S. It was getting old and had no internal memory - and as you know, not all apps can be moved to the SD card so I was constantly getting the ""low memory issues. This one seems to have enough internal to handle whatever cannot be moved to SD (time will tell.) But I really like the feel of this phone. Feels sturdy in the hand. A bit smaller than the Galaxy but has a more solid feel to it. In portrait that smaller size does make for typing issues but I find the microphone very accurate and use it most of the time to type. Battery life so far seems very good as well. I leave the Bluetooth on all the time and used WIFI on and off throughout the day and it doesn't seem to drain. (I tend to keep my phone plugged in anyway so it wouldn't be an issue at home. Also, it has a removable battery - for me this is a HUGE advantage as I can buy a spare for traveling or really long days and just swap out the battery.I have used SPB Shell on the Galaxy but it slowed it down too much. Loaded on this and ran great. But the Sony interface is so nice, I switched back to that.The only two quibbles so far are the size (keyboard) and the loudness of the speaker phone (too quiet) but I use Bluetooth most of the time so not an issue.Worked out of the box - threw in SIM card and memory card and off it went.So far, so good."

(due to the fact that this is not a true Android phone but rather an ""overlay""or something like that) not all apps work reliably (snapchat videos wouldn't always play, i experienced lag many times, apps would shut off) and something that was built-in, the camera, stopped working reliably, making me miss out on many photo opportunities. I decided i no longer wanted a phone that made me wonder every time i turned it on if something was going to work.aside from things like that, the phone is beautiful, compact, and lightweight. i would have kept it if the operating system was more reliable."

But i wanted a very sexy phone too... so after a lot of research, i found this one that fitted my needs and surpassed my expectations. To begin i dont like ""phones"" with huuuuuge displays, cause the are... logically... HUGE!!! To me they are unconmfortable to hold and operate... and i planned to spend 300$ tops and demonstrate that a very useful phone can cost less than 400$... and this one did it! The 4 inches screen is awesome... very sharp, very coforful, crystal clear, awesomely bright, the whites are outstanding, the blacks not so much but is really decent, good contrast at all!!! The speed is so good, even after the ICS update. Runs smooth. The overall performance is great. The camera takes very good pictures, beyond ""acceptable"". The only cons i have to say (and i don't blame the phone byt the software) is cause after updating the phone, appeared many lags and rebooting troubles, even when after 1 minute the phone gets stable again, this is a pain, but i hope the recently announced upgrade to JB fixes this bugs. I truly recommend this phone so far. If you are on a budget, go for it! Won't regret it! Now it's a little bit cheaper.. around 280$.

But I realized after getting my Xperia P, that for 50 or 60 dollars more, you can get a larger screen and resolution with the Xperia S. I would have payed the difference. I don't know what I was thinking, but now that I got mine and compare with more expensive cellphones, I could have gotten something better just paying 60 dollars more. And the Xperia S is still way cheaper than the Galaxy S III and the Iphones.In general, I gave 4 stars because it's an excellent deal for the price, but you can get more if you get the Xperia S."

After making the respective study, I decided on this Sony Xperia by large Characteristics and value. Just turn it on and connect to internet notifies you of the latest android update available for the phone which is downloaded via a PC and the Sony software. I have a week on the phone and I feel is tremendous equipment. It responds very well overall.The only two negative comments I have are:- The call audio is too low to be heard even at maximum volume available. This is inconvenient when you receive or make calls in places where you do not have almost total silence to hear clearly. The solution I opted for this problem was to use the speaker, but also becomes uncomfortable depending on where you are. I have to test with headphones to see how they listen.- The second problem, which is not a bad news but all these smart devices today, is the battery. This did not last more than 6-8 hours doing moderate use, otherwise it can take half.Of the rest I really like this phone and recommend it."

I am very satisfied with this phone. Everything works without a flaw, even after ICS. Great display, sound, and very fast. HDMI connection to my TV is great (purchased the cheap $3 micro HDMI cable here on amazon). No expandable memory slot but it has more than enough memory for me. The battery cannot be removed and people complain about its poor battery life. The battery life is amazing. I charge it every night, but even with moderate videos and 3D gaming, by the time I charge it there is 60% or more life left. I noticed under the phone's settings it allows NFC which allows the phone to exchange data with another phone just by touching them. I have not had a chance to try that yet.The phone is only 3G which is fine for me. Data bandwidth is 3mbps+ using speedtest in my area. 4G phones seem to burn battery life faster and I really don't need 4G at this point.Sony phones have outlasted and out performed every LG, Samsung or Motorola I have owned and have specially beaten the other companies at the price point. The technology of the Xperia line of products seem to also stay ahead of the competition. I am slowly becoming a diehard Sony customer.I currently use this phone (as I have with other smart phones) on the Straight Talk network. Have had no restrictions.

"390949","Sony Xperia P LT22i-BK Unlocked Phone with 8 MP Camera, Android 2.3 OS, Dual-Core Processor, and 4-Inch Touchscreen--U.S.Warranty (Black)",5,"I'm a person who wants a few things from a phone.1. Does the basics well (call, receive, messaging)2. The equipment is quality (display, camera, speaker, gps, browser)3. Relatively modern without the expensive price. (I could care less about the latest edge in smartphones, anything that is outdated before its warranty ends should not be a heavy investment.)This phone fulfilled these challenges rather nicely.Description:This phone has a 4"" display, finished with a rounded aluminum backing in matte black. The bar that contains the android's back, home, and menu keys is transparent. The top of the phone has the 3.5mm jack. The bottom piece is a removable plastic cap. Removing it will expose a label that shows the serial/manufacturer info. The speakerphone is on the right side of the phone, below that is the power/unlock screen button, below that button is the volume adjustment, and ends with a 2-stage dedicated camera button. There is a front facing camera for skype and a rear facing 8mp camera (6mp when used in 16:9 widescreen) equipped with a bright LED flash. On the left side of the phone there is the micro-usb charging port, the micro hdmi ouput, the slot for microsim. The micro usb and hdmi ports are uncovered whereas the microsim port is covered. Comes with in-ear headphones w/ microphone as linked here Sony MH750 Stereo Headset with Microphone and Answer/End Button for Cell Phones - Black (Bulk Packaging) Factory unlocked with 1 year manufacturer warranty.The good:-Screen quality and brightness. Big and bright with 960x540 resolution. The indoor/outdoor visibility of the screen is just phenomenal. All the displayed text is legible and all the colors are only minimally washed out even in the southern California sunlight. At times, I use this phone in the dark and the backlight adjustment is just perfect. My eyes aren't strained at all when I do my 10-20 minute web browsing/Angry Birds session before I sleep. The screen is bright enough to be used outdoors and sensitive enough to be used indoors. As an added touch it comes with a screen protector applied by the factory.-The camera. It is quick to focus, flash, and take a picture. The camera key can be used to activate the camera when the phone is in sleep (have to really press down on it for .5s), and it can be set to whether the phone will take a picture directly or just focused. This camera wake-up option (called Quick Launch by Sony) can be disabled altogether.-Speaker phone quality. It's not tinny and sharp and its loud enough.-Cellphone reception. It's been good for me even on T-mobile even without 3G and the other bands as seen in the chart Amazon as provided. WiFi strength is reasonably strong.-Texting. 3 choices in keyboard layout, traditional T9 and 2 versions of QWERTY. There is a gesture function (dragging your finger across the letters of a word will automatically type the word), texting too quickly will activate this function so I turned it off. Auto-correct can be fully tamed. The voice-to-text works really well for me, I tried the tongue twister ""She sells sea shells by the sea shore"" and it worked for the most part. The only mistake that it made was instead of sea it inputted see. There are options of different language keyboards as well, English, Chinese, and Japanese.-Optimization of Android OS by Sony. Very quick to jump from menu to menu, app to app. Applies updates independently with just a WiFi source. Facebook integration works, Skype works depending on bandwith strength.-Overall quality and feel. Thin and well weighted. The touchscreen is very responsive asides from the trouble I have swiping across screens with 1 hand. The transparent bar's keys are very responsive. It is incredibly distinct with its design, unlike those other just rectangular bars with a big screen.-No software required to connect the Xperia P to a PC. It opens up the ~12gb of usable space like a flash drive, transfers files drag and drop style. There's an optional Xperia companion software, but I prefer the simplicity of dragging and dropping files.-Language options. The Xperia P comes loaded with 50+ languages including multiple dialects of English, Spanish, and Chinese. As a cruel joke someone can set the language to Basa Sunda, Galego, Shqipe, or Srpski.-The included in-ear headphones aren't the best but it's better than the cheap earbuds normally packaged with phones. The headphone's wire lacks a slider because it's the behind the neck style wire where the left bud's wire is 1/2 to 1/3 the length of the right bud.The bad:-Subpar battery life unless all battery saving apps are on. Leaving WiFi connected alone drained the battery in half over night. Turning on extended battery saving mode and energy saver mode on the display will double the battery life to about 2 days of moderate usage. I've managed to average 25% of battery usage daily by just sending/receiving texts with minimal WiFi usage.-Non-removable backplate and battery. Battery life estimations are exaggerated to say the least.-Battery gauge was finicky at first. I charged it at 20% and the battery gauge would stay at 20% even though I charged it for a full night. Restarting the phone would show 100%. This glitch is now gone after a week of usage.-No SD card expansion.-Auto-rotate isn't sensitive enough, I have to swing the phone around a bit if I'm laying down and texting.-Camera key is a little stiff. Focusing with the camera is easy, taking a snapshot takes quite a bit more effort.Update: 12/08/12-Be mindful of the proximity sensor on the phone or you'll end up hanging on whoever you're talking to. When your face is close enough to the phone, the screen will automatically lock however I'm used to using my shoulder to hold the phone against my face. The phone will go out of place and I'll end up hitting the End Call button really easily. Sony, if you're reading this, make the range on the proximity sensor go farther on future phones.-Restart the phone every couple of days because the apps will drain the phone's battery life even after closing them. I've forgotten to restart my phone after a busy week and I find the battery life being drained down to 65% overnight.-After a few months of usage, the phone isn't showing any signs of slowing down. I still love using this phone.Update: 4/26/13-Sony has finally delivered a 4.1 Jelly Bean update to the Xperia P. However this may have caused my phone to brick itself momentarily. One day, the OS just stopped being responsive so I restarted the phone, only to have to fail to initialize and get to the homepage. So I used sony's update software to hopefully just patch and update from ICS to Jellybean. This didn't work either so I had to reformat. I consequently lost all my contacts and apps installed but still kept everything in the storage part of the phone (music, photos, etc). Since this problem was an easy fix and accidents do happen I still recommend this phone. I am not sure if this is Android's fault or Sony's fault and if this proves to be persistent than I will assume it's Sony's fault and will update this review.-On the plus side, 4.1 Jelly Bean adds Google Now and has updated the overall look of the phone ie screen lock, icons, menu layout, color themes etc. There is now a 'Stamina Mode' which replaced 'Extended Battery Mode' to increase battery life, it now provides an estimate of the stand-by time remaining. Sony Walkman has also been updated to have an equalizer and xClarity which is an automatic equalizer."

"390952","Sony Xperia P LT22i-BK Unlocked Phone with 8 MP Camera, Android 2.3 OS, Dual-Core Processor, and 4-Inch Touchscreen--U.S.Warranty (Black)",1,"After living with this phone for a month, the only good thing I can say about it is that it looks gorgeous. It is small enough to hold in your hand, yet you can easily see the display without squinting. However, everything else goes downhill from there.First off, let's talk about the hardware. The phone looked good when I took it out of the case, but as soon as I put it into my pocket, it got scratched by my driver's liscence! No, you read this correctly, a small plastic card managed to scratch the screen. Okay I though, I will just be more carefull and buy a case and never keep anything else in the same pocket.Next, lets talk about the battery life. If you don't use your phone for any light web browsing, just simple text and calls throughout the day, you will get about 8 hours of battery life. If you do, say hello to a dead phone within the next 3 to 4 hours. Even with the ""stamina mode,"" battery life is nothing to be happy about.Let's move on to the operating system. The keyboard provided by the OEM is junk. The same goes for all the applications provided by Sony. You end up hitting the wrong key everytime and it will autocorrect without your permission. Sometimes, it will even stay on the screen even after you closed the application that was using it. This is important to consider because for some reason Sony thought that they had to dictate you to use every application. You cannot delete any of them, although you can use another one in its place. This is important to consider because this phone does not come with an miniSD card slot. Hence, you will only have about 11 Gb of memory available to begin with.However, the fun does not begin until you install the lastest version of android available for your phone! Jelly bean will really give you headache. As soon as I downloaded it, my phone began to shut itself off randomly about 3-7 times a day. I would have my default applications and widgets switched with the OEM applications. My phone would make random phone calls or delay sending and recieving text messages until the next day(s). It would also reload things that I had deleted or removed from my phone.All in all, this phone was a nightmare. It was a mistake. I am left with a 240 dollar brick that has a mind of its own. I actually had to dig up my brother's old blackberry because of how many things went wrong with this phone. The worst being a 40 dollar data overage fee from my service provider because of it downloaded updates even after I had the settings for data usage turned off. Stay away from this phone or be prepared to root it. That is the only way to get a smooth experience because it has way too many bugs. For the record, I did root it, but I still have a terrible battery life and a ton of scratches."

The battery runs out really quickly and it takes approximately 8-10 HOURS for the battery to fully recharge. This is a bummer... and the battery is built in so if you try to remove it. ..that will actually void the warranty on your the phone."

Everything works well except the autorotation function has never worked. Running Jelly Bean. Tried holding down up-volume and power buttons simultaneously but did not fix autorotation. Tried reset, again did not help. Haven't yet gotten anyone to solve the problem.Otherwise, I like the phone. I'm using it without a SIM card. Works well with my home network; camera is good but slow; email and web access good; lots of good apps available; good feel with Incipio case (which I recommend).If it weren't for that darned autorotation thing, this would be a real winner."

I got mine 3 weeks ago and it has given me grief every day. It will either lock up or shut down randomly, the apps on it want to work every other day, some phone calls don't ring and when you miss them, they don't show a missed call. The biggest issue is when it locks up though. it happens when my phone runs dead. I will charge it and try and boot it up, but doesn't work. they tell you to force restart, doesn't work. by the end of it the phone decides it wants to work and you don't know how the hell it turned back on. Stay clear of this phone, its cheap for a smart phone but your paying way too much for a dud."

It exceeded my expectations by far. As soon as I upgraded it to 4.1 I was really impressed, there was no lagging and the camera is just incredible, my old phone was 8.1mp and this one is just way better, the auto scene selection feature works great. I compared it to iPhone 5 and based on the features that this phone has I say it's a winner."

WE EVEN HAD TO RETURN THE FIRST ONE, NO PROBLEM AT ALL. TRULEY ENJOYED THIS TRANSACTION. Did not like the screen protectors."
"390960","Sony Xperia P LT22i-BK Unlocked Phone with 8 MP Camera, Android 2.3 OS, Dual-Core Processor, and 4-Inch Touchscreen--U.S.Warranty (Black)",5,"I think that it is important to state I have never owned a smartphone prior to this purchase. I never thought it practical to own one on the premise that I'd be stuck in a contract with some lousy company and spend $130 per month (college student/part-time work). Unlocked = no contract? Hell yeah. Tech awareness level: I OWN an ASUS g75V, 12 Gb RAM, nVidia GTX 670M, it's pretty cool but that's a different story, I emphasize own because I don't want you to think that I chisel designs in rocks for fun.Anyway, enough pre-review ramble there is plenty review ramble to kill a few minutes of your time. Sorry, non-refundable. Take it for what it's worth: If you want to skip the specifics of my review, go to the end and I will briefly restate the points made throughout in the last paragraph. Thanks :)The OS needs an update upon delivery. This is, apparently, important to do with ALL Android phones upon update: you must do a factory reset after you update your phone to 4.0 (ice cream sandwich), or else you will have APN issues, and certainly other software incompatibilities. This will mess with your multimedia message delivery and probably some other important things I can't fathom. Make sure you factory reset the phone before you do anything after the update, because you will inevitably reset it at one point and lose this info. Don't back up anything until you reset, unless you have rooted chances are you didn't remove the default APN t-mobile settings. (Trust me it is in this order.) In order to set the APN to your carrier, I think installing the micro SIM card, update the phone software through WiFi or internet, and a factory reset in that order would be the solution. (I run AT&T and spent quite a bit of time trying to swap out of the t-mobile default before resetting.)Still no jellybean, which is version 4.1. Apparently it's an awesome OS, but the Xperia P will not have the ability to update to this version for a few months. Other 2012 models already have the capability of updating to jellybean, which was disappointing to hear about, but quite frankly it was not that expensive and the specs on this phone kick ass anyway. Hopefully February-March? Doesn't bother me, but I'm sure others would like to have the newest software now. For that matter, jellybean 4.2 is coming with wireless hdmi stream! (For Nexus tablet)The processor is fast. It has 1 gig of RAM and it seems to be using about 300mb default to run the phone itself. I'm sure there are background processes going on that I can remove (live wallpapers?? dafuk!), but I was a bit disappointed to run Pandora, and notice that my phone was sitting at 40% of it's memory. This does not impede it's performance. I haven't rooted the phone yet, so I'm sure possibilities exist that I currently do not understand. Streams media 1 process at a time, but it's fast and high quality. This means that if you are listening to music and you open a new media file, it will pause/mute the other (DUH), or if you turn on the camera while listening to music it will also pause/mute until you exit out of the camera.If you go to GSMArena and compare a few phones you'll find that it has the same CPU as the iPhone 4S, but the Xperia P has 2x more RAM. So you can laugh at your outdated friends and family who tote the 4s or less. Anyway, look for yourself if you are interested: google GSM arena and search phone models.The 8MP camera is great. It has superb resolution at close-mid range zoom. If you zoom in all the way, there will be heavy pixelation and a delayed focus, especially if you are aiming at something far away. This sounds like common sense, but I think it should be said anyway. There are also edit options for photos that can enhance resolution. Man you can see like pores on people's faces and stuff. Gross! I have no complaints about the front camera.The speaker: Crystal clear speaker phone. Decent volume level: I compared to a Samsung Galaxy S3 and was put in the dirt. The volume on stock for SG3 was 2x higher than the Xperia P. I read that it can be amped up higher, but I wouldn't chance blowing out the speaker. That would not be fun!The headphone jack antennae is very sensitive so be sure to stand in open spaces, or be away from interference if you want to have best quality reception. I listened to radio for about an hour while messing with the phone, it is clear as day if you are in the right position. The only benefit I think to this function is that you can listen to the radio if you're on the go with those specific headphones in, but realistically it doesn't seem very practical considering you can access internet radio or play libraries of music from the phone itself. To each their own. The ear buds are excellent quality, however. I can hardly hear with them in and no sound on! Sony quality if you don't want to buy a set of Bose or Beats.This phone comes preloaded with tons of useful apps. It also has a few that I guess you wouldn't need that most likely run in the background. I read that you don't need antivirus on an android/smartphone? Whatever I'll leave that one for now, but I guess some other apps such as weather and multimedia player can be removed for faster processing speeds/less memory use. This being my first smartphone, you bet I went crazy in that app store! However, I have not removed any apps that were preloaded. You should always check your running tasks to ensure apps you thought you closed aren't still running in the background. That would kill the battery and slow the phone down.I really like the design of this phone. Buy a screen protector and at least a rubber case. It is made of plastic! I think .. But anyway if you drop it or scratch it it will most likely lose color and just become an ugly mess, so be careful. For some reason, Otterbox has no love for Xperia P. #fragileBattery life ... Hah! Well I can't say I'm surfing the internet, streaming videos, and whatever my manager is doing on his phone when he says hes taking a break every 10 minutes, etc. Don't expect much, the screen itself is 40-50% of the power consumption of this phone. It is probably using all that RAM I can't seem to find! Lol. You get a cool power consumption tool that tells you how wasteful that 4"" screen is! It was at 75% before I checked off a lower setting for brightness. I think I lose about 1% every 3.5-5 minutes browsing the internet/texting/streaming music. So it has roughly a 5.8--8.3 hour battery life if you aren't going crazy with the data use, I imagine. I think some people reported less than 4 hours? Cool story bro.I bought a RAVPower® 10400mAh Dynamo-On-the-Go RP-PB07 External Battery Pack after reading a bunch of low reviews on the Xperia P because I'm not a helpless child who can't solve insignificant matters. So there you go: want a badass power supply? Buy that too! Charges all kinds of things, inexpensive, portable- you're welcome. Want a product review? It's awesome.The fact that there is no external drive option for memory sort of bothered me. I mean, I guess I've never had to anticipate all the junk I could put on a phone before, just mp3 players and whatnot, but still what if I wanted more options?? Well, my friends, OTG cable saves the day. I won't get into 2.0 USB vs 3.0 USB (10x faster!) because I can't actually say I've uploaded data using the OTG cable with a flash drive into the phone, YET!. ***UPDATE*** This does work. I bought a 3.0 USB and was able to upload movies/music, temporarily for viewing. I do not think you can file manage with a USB attached, you probably need to sync to a computer to upload, although I could be wrong. Do note: using a flash drive in your phone DRAINS the battery. I don't recommend it unless you have a power supply nearby.*** However, if all goes well grab one of these mini-usb male->usb female adapters and bam you supposedly have all kinds of external storage space. Just go buy the flash drive? If it works I'll change this paragraph at a later time. I can say that I plugged my Razer DeathAdder mouse into the OTG cable into the Xperia P and guess what?!? I had a cursor! So cool!It has a mini-HDMI slot, which is pretty cool. I could be cynical about it because I can't imagine how often you are in a setting where you have both your phone and an HDMI cable that you bought separately just for such occasions and you found an HD monitor/TV that just needed the crap stored in your phone to make things complete ... Oops. It's cool, really!Well I'm burnt out on this review. I should mention that GPS works perfectly. It's almost creepy to set it to my location and have a blue arrow floating in my room. Just make sure your data is enabled, of course! I generally leave data off unless I need it to check scores or I get lost somewhere and need to turn on Pandora while I check my facebook and there is no WiFi around, which I mean come on ... how often is that really? GPS data consumption is insignificant, just in case you were wondering.Conclusion: This phone is B A! If you buy it, remember to put your micro sim in, update OS to 4.0, and factory reset immediately. It's fast, faster than the iPhone 4s. If you need something faster, buy a laptop. The camera is great, there are minor flaws in zoom, but overall it is excellent quality with many options, front camera is good as well. The speaker isn't anything crazy, but it's clear and the volume is perfect for speaker phone or listening to music in a relatively quiet setting. The radio antennae is in the headphones, and they are surprisingly good quality. Preloaded with useful apps. Learn to root linux if you want to maximize the performance, but be careful. Fragile design, buy the appropriate accessories. Battery life varies from 4-8 hours. I have not experienced anything less than 6 hours, and I bought a power pack anyway 'cause that's how I do. No external memory drive. Buy OTG cable, connect a flash drive-there you go.I hope this review was helpful. I spent hours reading about various smartphones before I bought this one, and I am happy with my choice. It was extremely cheap, comparatively, and I did not even need a contract! Don't let those complainers fool you with their 2-3 star reviews, This phone deserves nothing less than a 4 (as I am sure others have owned more complex phones, or can afford more options in a single phone), but in my opinion it is a solid smartphone and I would rate 4.5 if it were possible, but it is not so I have rounded up. Thus the 5.0 review.Good luck!"

My usage is mostly voice and text with a bit of data thrown in for good measure. I upgraded to the latest version of android at the Sony site and all went smoothly. I also installed a battery saver app. Apparently the app is working because my battery life is satisfactory. I signed up with Consumer Cellular with no contract and they sent me a SIM card for free and it arrived activated without being charged for the activation either. I slipped the SIM card into this Sony and was all set to go.The USB cable that was furnished is pretty neat. It plugs into an adapter which in turn is plugged into an electrical outlet to charge the battery. Or, the cable can be removed from the adapter and plugged directly in a USB port on your PC. One cable does it all. A Startup Guide is provided as well. If you want more detail then the Startup Guide provides you can go to the Sony site and read or download a user manual. I decided to print a copy and it came to 152 pages which I put in a binder.There are many versions of the Sony Xperia and this P is a good one and, as I mentioned, it is compatible with Consumer Cellular and, being unlocked, probably other no-contract providers. This may be a bit off topic but I am so pleased to get away from the never-ending two year contract scam that I need to get it of my chest. Every time I made a change to my service or phone it was another automatic renewal of the two year contract. I was paying more than twice as much for just voice as I am paying Consumer Cellular for voice, text and data. Now I can go online, not talk to anyone, and make all kind of changes and it does not cost anything to do so. I am not a shill for Consumer Cellular but for any no-contract provider. What a relief!"

Is exactly what I thought when I set my sights on this phone on amazon. I wanted to replace my iPhone, which I've been a loyal iPhone user for the past 3 or so years, I wanted a change. The Xperia P arrived in less than a week in the mail along with the Skinomi case I purchased along with it. I activated this phone luckily with no activation or sim card fee at my local ATT store. It took a few hours for ATT tech support over the phone to help me configure the data settings (given that I had to call them a few times just to get to an experienced tech) so that I can access the internet and what not. Unfortunately, I still cannot send or received MMS, I've tried configuring manually via googling and youtubing and through ATT tech support, still no luck.Another pitfall with this phone is the battery. I've had this phone for only 2 weeks and last week sometime I left the battery drain all the way as I didn't have a charger handy. I figured an overnight charge would fix this but I was wrong. The next morning I tried powering the phone on and nothing. I was on the phone with Sony support and the first tech sounded like she didn't know what the hell she was doing. I called back and luckily had someone who was (again) experienced enough to help me through this, I was afraid that the phone was deffective (which I'm starting to think it is) and I might have to send it in, being stuck with a basic replacement phone (oh no!). The tech walked me through the trouble shooting and I ended up having to charge the phone for a couple hours(again) as instructed by the Sony tech. After the charge he walked me through it and SURPRISINGLY my phone powered on. What the hell is up with this phone and its battery???? The SAME thing happened to me this morning. I had my phone on the charger last night because it was at about 20%, woke up a couple times during the night to see it was decreasing!! aka DISCHARGING what is this??? I woke up in the morning to see that my phone was completely dead, not turning on, still on its charger..... I contacted the vendor through amazon: Techno.Trading.House, they suggested I do a factory reset which ""might fix it"".. I said screw it, I'm not going through that trouble since my phone is on now, I just need to baby the s*** out of it and keep an eye on the battery... (real time) my phone just restarted itself, what the hell is going on with this phone?!I also forgot to mention that when I got the phone I turned it on and the screen greeted me in a foreign language, it might've been chinese and I kept pressing buttons to get something I COULD understand... This phone is GREAT otherwise...."

I updated the latest and had problems with the phone that took me two days to correct. Also the software that goes on your computer is not well thought out. It wants to copy aqll your email lists even if you don't want it too and then you have to manually delete as desired. Plus I am still having trouble downloading internal photos using the phone as a form of a usb. There is most likely an easier way but the phone handbook is pretty sketchy and using sony's web site hasn't improved these problems...they are hard to contact and get solid answers from.From a android platform phone standpoint this is a really easy phone to use, has a lot of free apps and is fun to use. the camera works great in all but the closest focusing. too much close focusing on the zoom produces grainy photos."

But i wanted a very sexy phone too... so after a lot of research, i found this one that fitted my needs and surpassed my expectations. To begin i dont like ""phones"" with huuuuuge displays, cause the are... logically... HUGE!!! To me they are unconmfortable to hold and operate... and i planned to spend 300$ tops and demonstrate that a very useful phone can cost less than 400$... and this one did it! The 4 inches screen is awesome... very sharp, very coforful, crystal clear, awesomely bright, the whites are outstanding, the blacks not so much but is really decent, good contrast at all!!! The speed is so good, even after the ICS update. Runs smooth. The overall performance is great. The camera takes very good pictures, beyond ""acceptable"". The only cons i have to say (and i don't blame the phone byt the software) is cause after updating the phone, appeared many lags and rebooting troubles, even when after 1 minute the phone gets stable again, this is a pain, but i hope the recently announced upgrade to JB fixes this bugs. I truly recommend this phone so far. If you are on a budget, go for it! Won't regret it! Now it's a little bit cheaper.. around 280$.

But, this doesn't mean much if the phone only works part of the time. First the phone started acting funny, so I called customer support. The ""technology wizards"" at Sony said I needed to update to the newest software and everything would be fine. It wasn't. The screen would occasionally freeze and would not let you do anything unless you turned it off. One problem, it wouldn't let you turn it off no matter how long you held the button down. It has a built in battery so you couldn't take that out to restart it either. You have to do a hard reset by press several buttons until the phone finally resets. It then takes around two full minutes to reboot. Hopefully you weren't expecting an important phone call. This freezing issue happened around three to four times a day. Other than this major issue, the phone looks great and sounds great. But that alone doesn't make it worth buying. If you are going to spend $300 on a phone, get a used iPhone or a Samsung Droid. I have had both and they are much better than this Sony."

Call me silly. This phone does everything except wipe your mouth while you eat and tuck you in at night. I do like the sleek design. (I ordered a ""like new"" phone, by the way, and it arrived with a hairline scratch on the face. I was not amused. This did not affect the functioning, however.) I like the color, and I like the fact that I can put some apps on the phone. I don' t like how, for example, since I've downloaded the skype app, all my Skype contacts are in the contact list. Also, sometimes it appears the bluetooth feature turns on by itself. In addition, it just does too much stuff automatically, and ""for me,"" being as user friendly as it is... like pinpointing my location. The phone has a mind of its own. Call me old fashioned, but I think I've bitten off more than I can chew. For the tech-savvy, or those who want a phone that does everything... this one would be the one to buy."

Very good with great package of technology (1 ghz dual core,1gb RAM, good graphics gpu,NFC,White magic technology, etc )2. Very light in weight,3. Awesome display resolution,4. Best video quality, and5. Mind-blowing white magic technology.6. Walkman with In-ear headphone is top of all.7. 8 mp camera with 1080 p video recording is on its best.but I ve found some cons in this phone.1. Even though the RAM capacity is 1 GB, the mobile phone lags a bit in ICS 4.0.2. The Automatic screen rotation has some bugs. When I rotate the screen during the main screen (desktop screen) it goes weird, full black display with battery info,time, notifications at the top row. and also the screen flickers. (had reset it twice but still experiencing this issue)3. dedicated loud-speaker is not that good to hear songs. and also it pointed towards the right side so 1 sided audio doesn't impressed me enough.4. Inbuilt-Battery is the worst idea.. it's not at all lasts for a day. some time If u browse for 3 hours the battery will ve gone to 0%.5. No sd card slot. sony should have considered this.And about the package, I didn't receive the HDMI-media cable. It clearly mentioned that the box has HDMI cable. but I found only an empty space inside the box at the space for HDMI media cable. I have to make a compliant regarding this."
"391025","Sony Xperia P LT22i-RD Unlocked Phone with 8 MP Camera, Android 2.3 OS, Dual-Core Processor, and 4-Inch Touchscreen--U.S.Warranty (Red)",5,"This phone is awesome! It made a great first impression when it showed up. I could not use it as a phone for a short time, because I did not have a micro sim for it. I ordered a micro sim cutter and cut my old Straight Talk At&t sim card. It fit perfectly and I got immediate results. The cool thing about this is that Straight Talk has no idea I am using this instead of my old phone. One issue I have had so far was I couldnt figure out how to get the data to work. It ended up being an easy fix though, cause all I had to do was modify the APN settings. There are a lot of haters out there saying the battery life sucks, but so far it has been better than I expected. The phone offers all kinds of options to save on battery power. With limited use I could make a full charge last 2-3 days. It showed up already set up with Android Ice Cream Sandwich (ICS) which is also great. I read and watched a lot of reviews on this phone and everyone was saying its a great ""middle of the road"" smartphone, but I say its right up there with at least an Iphone 4S. The camera is exactly what I wanted, and the dual processor is really quick and smooth. If you are looking to save money by using a no contract GSM carrier, this is a great way to go."

"391033","Sony Xperia P LT22i-RD Unlocked Phone with 8 MP Camera, Android 2.3 OS, Dual-Core Processor, and 4-Inch Touchscreen--U.S.Warranty (Red)",4,"I bought this phone for my wife. She loves it. From my perspective, it is a good Android-based phone that has lived up to and exceeded expectations. One motivation to get this phone (besides price) was that it would work with an existing SIM card and handles data using WiFi only (i.e. no need for new contract and costly cell data plan). In all this it works like a champ! ...and no unintentional cell data charges due to hidden data features that we've run across with previous branded (locked) AT&T phone.The process of moving from older phone with a regular SIM card was a little tricky. We needed to cut/trim it to fit the micro-SIM slot. But, it was very easy once I found a template online (I think from CNET.)The only complaint I heard early on was how much Android changes between upgrades. After a few days she upgraded from 3.x (out of the box) to 4.0. (4.1 will be available in mid-2013!) It took some time to re-learn where feature options/settings are controlled. Also had to figure out where the Android feature settings are versus Sony/Xperia features are set. No biggie. My wife is quite tech-savvy. And despite initial complaints of ""where did that go?"", I think, like most of us Android users, she enjoys the ""adventure"" of figuring out the new features. (So long as it does not interfere with the core functionality.)A biggest complaint is that it is tricky to configure the messaging to support sending photos via text messaging (SMS/MMS). This is an AT&T SMS/MMS configuration issue that many folks using unlocked phones on AT&T's network seem to have. I cannot comment for other carriers.UPDATE (02/06): I recently spent some time to find out how to get this working on the AT&T SMS/MM network. I found the correct settings in the Android Central forums. (Go to Android Central and Search for ""AT&T Android SMS configuration setup"".) Unfortunately once it is working, it appears to require some data usage to send photos via MMS. But, oddly enough, not for receiving.(See NOTE below) In any case, my wife is happy to have this capability working. Despite the extra $2-$4 it periodically adds to our cell phone bill, it is still much cheaper than a full mobile data plan.Minor cons: No external Flash memory expansion (but with 16G internal and cloud storage apps avail... not a big prob); Non-removable battery (I know it is the norm nowadays.); external access to microSIM slot (This probably is a great feature for international traveler. But doesn't this make it easier for thieves to make use of the phone by swapping SIM?)Finally, some pros worth mentioning: nice quality camera; great audio features; crisp clear screen; beautiful aluminum body/case... almost a shame to cover with a protective case (but, too risky not to.) My wife loves the red. Finally, Sony will support the latest Android builds with support for 4.1 in 2013. (No need to upgrade hardware to take advantage of new OS! Plenty of CPU & RAM ""horse-power"" to grow.)Great job Sony!NOTE: It is my understanding that technically SMS/MMS is not supposed to use the high-bandwidth mobile data network that email and web browsing requires. So IMHO, there should be no mobile data usage/charges. Apparently AT&T thinks otherwise if you use an Android phone. Maybe it is an Android ""issue""?"

My father owns an Ace Plus and the screens will slide at any side at any moment...I like the fact you cant move the Connection Setup Screen everywhere... It's freedom...In the other hand, Sony please, read this: You should have an app manager more easy and efficient in order to improve the use of the capacity of the phone, sometimes it gets ""stucked"" by all the apps that just can't (or don't know how to) close... I added an App Manager but not feeling comfortable to give access to an unknown developer that responsibility.Audio: It has a great music player, the 3D sound is awesome, although if you use some earphones but, for apps like Voxer is sort of difficult to really use it because it's not louder enough so, it's better to use chat systems like Whatsapp...I know some people may not understand why if I'm writing this hard review am I giving 4 stars then?...

"391051","Sony Xperia sola MT27i-BLK Unlocked Phone with 5 MP Camera, Android 2.3 OS, 1 GHz Dual-Core Processor, and 3.7-Inch Touchscreen--U.S. Warranty (Black)",1,"UPDATE (FINAL): I have returned this device. It had problems not being able to connect to WPA2 WiFi networks, and had a low battery life. I got over this by buying USB cables and extra plug and downgraded my home network to WPA. I updated to ICS which should have fixed this. It fixed the WPA2 (see below), but added more problems. After updating to ICS, WiFi is constantly turning itself off and when surfing the web in Firefox (since Chrome is so slow it is unusable) will lose WiFi and say Offline (even though I do have 3G coverage). The phone is no longer able to connect to my Google Apps email account over ActiveSync. Now the phone will constantly freeze up on simple tasks like checking email (app says No Mail and then finally shows the messages that were already there), Firefox or other apps turn black and then freeze. My biggest problem, is that when I am not on WiFi, sometimes it will just not give data access to certain apps (for example I get Network error on Amazon app, but can go to Amazon.com in Firefox, although the keyboard will not type in the search box on some sites (including Amazon), so my ability to check prices on the go is destroyed (this happens sometimes, and restarting sometimes will fix it). However, when doing small tasks and trying to surf the web I constantly lose WiFi and get Offline or No Internet Error. I contacted Sony about downgrading back to GingerBread (which had its problems but they were livable; through exterior changes) and they said I would have to send it to them (which is not practical). I really liked this phone it is a nice looking phone and worked well. However, these problems are adding up and are getting worse, I tried really hard to make this work, but it just is not working and its problems are making it useless (I try to get to a computer over using it, which defeats the problem of a smartphone). I also wanted to mention that the phone side of the ICS update was ridiculously slow. Receiving a call would make the phone ring, but the screen would not light up. After about two rings the phone would light up and you had to hurry and answer before it got sent to voicemail. The phone app on the device is also very slow, just scrolling through contacts or dialing (pressing numbers) would be slow to react and occasionally pressing a number would not do anything and all of a sudden it would just blare the sound for about three seconds (like if you held it down). A phone is not to useful if it is slow to just make and receive phone calls.Below is the original review; it covers many aspects (good and bad) as well as the problems. However, the problems in ICS are significant and make it unusable (constantly losing network and freezing using simple apps). If you decide on this phone I do not recommend upgrading, or at least waiting for Jelly Bean (which might never come, due to the time it takes for upgrades from Sony). -- I really did like this phone, but these bugs are too much!UPDATE: ICS has been released. I was able to plug into Bridge for Mac and download ICS (availability is by country, and some may be able to get OTA update depending on carrier). However, I have been having some problems with this update. First, the phone would not update without me doing a repair (which does a clean install), which is not a big deal, since clean installs are preferred by me (this was a problem with Bridge not the phone, if you are using PC Companion you might not have this problem). First off, I really like the new interface!UPDATE: I have found that having Glove Mode enabled causes the phone to respond to my cell phone case (Belkin belt sleeve for iPhone). Making it occasionally unlock and interact with the case. I have also found that the screen now stays unlock after a BlueTooth call (since I had to disable security to have lock screen alerts), and that the case interacts with the phone launching apps. I think the phone needs to go back to sleep after a call (if previously asleep), I might have to reenable security and just not have lock screen notifications. -- I wish I could have both like in Gingerbread....UPDATE: I have found that the WiFi issue (not working with WPA2) is gone. However, I have found that a new WiFi issue is present that will work then stop periodically throughout use. I have found the problem seems to be with Wireless B, if you have a wireless router try setting it to Wireless G, Wireless N or mixed (I had it on Wireless B/G at first). I set it to Mixed and it now works perfectly, and I stay connected all the time.UPDATE: I have found a problem with email, when using a Corporate account (Google Apps for Education), I have to accept the Remote Management Rules; however, once I do and the account is added emails will come through and everything appears to work, however, all emails are White (blank) except for header (who from, who to, and Subject). All emails in this account are blank, if the account is setup in Gmail app it works fine, or if setup as IMAP in Stock it works, just not as ActiveSync in Stock Email. I believe the problem is with the Remote Management. I have tried several settings from the Google Apps Control Panel, and nothing makes it work. I have emailed Google to see if they will remove the mobile management feature from the Google Apps account, and am waiting to hear back. I guess if I cannot get it to work I will have to use IMAP, although that is a waste of battery... If I find a solution I will post it here!UPDATE: Google Chrome is unbearably slow on this phone, I switched to Firefox and it seems to work better. Chrome has some neat features, but it is so large and slow it is a nightmare to use, Firefox works great (better than stock, as far as speed).The interface is great, the menus and options looks great! When i first started the phone after updating to ICS, the phone background was changed, it was the ribbon, but did not feel right, it only moved when you scroll, not just by hovering your finger. After digging around I found the old ribbon with floating touch interaction, go to Settings > Wallpaper >> Live Wallpaper >> and it is Cosmic Flow (you can change color by going to Settings from that menu) -- The Theme setting will change it to that scroll one, but you can get the live one by going to Cosmic Flow.The lock screen is improved (and worse at the same time). You can now access the camera from the lock screen, and if you have Pandora or other radio playing you can go to next track from the lock screen (swipe the clock to the left; used to you could only control the built in music player, now it is whatever is playing). Now, the lock screen is worse, because you now have to choose to either have the swipe (where you get those features) or to have a lock on it (pattern, PIN, or password). You cannot have both (use to you would swipe and then pattern), now if you have pattern on you see it when you hit power button. Also, if you have anything other than swipe, you will not see notifications in the lock screen. For example, if setup you can see emails (who and subject) in the lock screen above the slide, and then you can know who the email is from without opening the phone, now if you have a lock screen (other than slide) you will have to always unlock. I like being able to see at a glance if something is important, so I took off security and have slide, but I wish they would have kept the Slide then lock type (I should not have to choose between ease of use and security); although remember, I cam from the iPhone and am used to that layout.The menus are nice looking and apps just look better now. I like the app switch (hold down home) and the slide them to close them, it is very nice!The Walkman app is very nice and has a nice look and feel to it.Chrome is now on the phone. However, Chrome has been ridiculously slow, and using it freezes this phone to where you cannot interact with it, until you are able to kill chrome. The Stock browser is not that much better. I also, find that when using Chrome or Stock that the Wifi icon will disappear and I will get the No Internet Message in Chrome or Stock. I am going to reinstall Firefox and see if it is any better. So far browsing is a nightmare.The email app is greatly improved (and also loss a little), the new options are nice and the ability to remember safe senders for images are nice. You can also choose which account to send new emails from, from the message (use to you had to open that inbox, or it would always use default account). However, there is no way to default to Combined Inbox, and occasionally simple messages (just text) will be completely blank on the screen, I will have to use the computer to see the messages, because the Mail app will not open them (well, it opens them, just does not show anything). You can also no longer zoom out to see the entire message from the screen, the app zooms in to where it thinks it is best and you can not zoom out (you could do this in Stock Mail app in GB, but never in Gmail app). One good thing, is now when you see a message on the phone's lock screen and you open it on your computer, it will remove itself from the lock screen and stop flashing the green light on the phone (used to all messages would backlog on the lock screen and then when you unlock they would go away, now they go away as you open them elsewhere (like on a computer). -- Great improvement!The phone's performance, is adequate, sometimes it runs great, other times it gets so slow I cannot use it, and have to restart it. It has crashed on me once (where all of a sudden the Sony logo pops up and the phone reboots). I have also went to Shut Down phone and it restarts itself (makes me think it crashed while shutting down).Battery is not that great, using Chrome for about 10 minutes drained the battery by 10%. battery was not that great before, but it seems worse (I am not using the battery saver thing, since it turns off networking when sleep, and that defeats the purpose of a smartphone).The ICS copy/paste and text alterations are really great, and a lot easier to use than that hold and wait system in GB.NFC is also improved and you can do more with NFC, although I do not like the new icon in the top for NFC, it is large and takes up space in my already overfilled bar (battery now has a percentage gauge that I cannot turn off).I am still trying to improve the performance of my unit with ICS, I really like the features and use, but right now Internet browsing is horrible. I am going to reinstlal Firefox, and play with it and see if it is better. There are so many great changes, but then there are these compromises you have to make which really take away from the greatness. I am happy with the upgrade, and after some more fine tuning, it should be better. I will keep you informed, and hopefully the problems I am facing will be fixed by an update.Here is the original Review (note, this is in Gingerbread, see above for ICS related items):So this is my first Android smartphone, I have an iPhone ever since the iPhone 3G was released (had iPhone 3G then iPhone 4), so switching to Android was a big change (my iPhone 4 stopped working, and I felt it was time for a change).Firs off, I looked at the Xperia U, but the lack of Micro SD card slot, made me come up to the Sola, since the built in 8GB (only 4GB usable same on U and Sola) was not enough to even hold my music.I also, like this phone since it is the same size as the iPhone 4 (almost identical), this one has a large screen, but the body is identical (just a mm or so larger). This was important to me since it means most of the iPhone accessories work with this phone, like my holster and my sport armband, this phone fits in perfectly and since the headphone jack is on top it matches the iPhone.To let you know I use Straight Talk here in the USA (Bring your Own Phone, AT&T Based Micro SIM; from my iPhone 4). I also purchased a Micro SIM adapter for this phone, since it used a regular sized SIM. However, once I got the phone I found that I did not need it since the phone included a Micro SIM adapter. The SIM card slot on this phone is a very open slot under the back wall so you do not have to fear too much about it getting jammed (I would be nervous using an adapter if I had to slide the SIM card deep into the phone). Also, the Micro SIM adapter included with this phone had a piece of double sided tape that would stick to the Micro SIM and keep it in place, so it getting jammed is not much of a problem (I have no issue using my Micro SIM in the adapter included with this phone). -- It was a great bonus to have the adapter come with this phone! Most do not include it and I wish I knew it was included before I purchased one, however, the fact that it came with it made this phone great!I set it up (if you are using a prepaid network do not use the APN setting down loader (from Sony in the phone) since it will not find it (at least for Straight Talk, it tries to use ATT). Once I got the phone setup I went to Settings and added my APN and MMS settings from the Straight Talk website and it worked perfectly (3G/EDGE and MMS all worked).The floating touch one of the feature of this phone is neat to play with on the home screen, but really only works on the stock browser. When viewing websites that have mouse over events this feature allows you to hover over the phone and the site will react as if you are mousing over it. It has some neat uses on certain websites. But over all except for playing with the scrolling ribbon on the home page it is not very useful, Sony says they hope to make it a bit more useful in future releases. However, it has promise!I also found that WiFi was easy to setup, however, it did not like my WPA2-PSK network, so I lowered it to WPA, and it worked perfectly. This is not an issue with the phone, but with Android (since you will find it online all over the place about others having this problem regardless of the phone), if you downgrade your home network security it will work [the problem is the wifi looping through Connected - Connecting - Obtaining IP - Disconnected constantly]. Hopefully this will be fixed in Android Ice Cream Sandwich or Jelly Bean.The phone has a great looking display responds quickly (no dragging) and looks great! The design that Sony gave this phone is gorgeous and the Sony interface is beautiful, the phone has a nice music player from the lock screen (scroll the lock screen clock to the left), and has a slide to unlock like the iPhon, or slide to Turn Sounds ON/OFF). You can also set a pass code or maze lock on the phone. Movies play instantly (on the SD card) and look amazing, that Bravia engine greatly improves how the video looks! The camera takes great pictures and video and it has a bright flash that helps low light pictures. The phone has some neat features like auto smile camera (takes photos when it sees a smile automatically) and auto face focus.I use Gmail and Google Apps for my email, and found that using the Stock Android app works the best (over the Gmail app); I found that the Gmail app cannot scroll out to see large emails (with images), and notifications just work better on the Stock email app (where I can see the from and subject of email on lock screen). Messages works great and the phone app is nicely formatted. I tried the Stock web browser, but decided to go with Firefox (will probably switch to Google Chrome when ICS comes out).The NFC tags were not a big deal to me, however, I have grown to find them useful. I put the two that are included with the phone (Red and Black), on my night stand (on the wall above it), then when I go to bed I tap the phone on the Black one, it turns off sounds and launched the Alarm app [when sounds are off the alarm will still go off], and then when I wake up I tap the red one which sets the phone to Loud Sound. -- Just to note, the phone has to be on and unlocked for the tags to read. I have found this to be a quick way to go to sleep and wake up, without having to manually do everything. However, the tags can do so much more, so there is a lot of use you can find for them and they can control many aspects of the phone!The phone also paired easily with my Car (Ford Focus [SYNC]), however, I had to try twice to get it to take the pass code, but once it did the car downloaded the phone book and worked perfectly (no Text messaging through the car though, although the iPhone could not do it either), however, call waiting and call hold worked.As you can see this is a great phone, it works great, it looks great, and is easy to use.Now for the reason the item lost a star:The sound is not that loud coming from the speaker. I believe the main problem is that the speaker is facing out from the back of the phone. Therefore the sounds are not going toward you, instead going toward the back. I wish the speaker was facing you or was on the bottom. You may find it easier when using speaker phone to hold the phone with the screen facing down. I also, have found that if the phone is laying on books or some other non hard material the speaker becomes muffled and is hard to hear, so I found to always leave it hanging over the books, or to keep it in the holster (I can hear it fine from in the holster). The headphone jack is on top and supports standard headphone jacks, the phone includes a pair of Sony in ear ones, but the in ear kind have never fit inside my ear.When I put the phone in my belt holster, I found that when using the phone (Bluetooth headset) when sitting down would constantly go to call fail. After testing and experimenting I found the problem. The antenna is at the top of the phone, thus when I would sit down the phone would press into my stomach and then when the phone was pressed against my stomach the antenna would be blocked and I would go to no Service. FIX: A quick fix I found was to always put the phone in the holster head first (top of phone in so the base of the phone pressed into my stomach). This fixed the problem and it no longer when to no service when in the car.OK, so I learned to live with the antenna problem by putting in the phone upside down in the holster. I then found another problem. BATTERY! I found that the phone would not last the entire day, so I started researching and found that if I turn down the display it would help, it was on 100% with Auto on, so I turned it down to about 30% with auto on and it still looked great and was super bright.I found many people recommend a Task Killer, however, my knowledge of LINUX would make me not want to use it since, I know that Android is automatically handing processes in the background and interfering will probably cause more battery use for the apps to restart in the background later, so I do not use a Task Killer.In the end I have Wifi, Cellular Data, Auto Sync, Bluetooth, GPS, NFC all on; Push email; and have display at 30% with auto brightness. I now get about 10 to 16 hours on a charge. It depends on my use of the phone, I find that making voice calls drain the battery the most, and if I make voice calls for more than 1 hour on a day I will probably only get 8 hours.I wish that Sony gave it a bigger battery, but for the price this is actually a pretty good battery life compared to other Android phones.In the end, this phone looks, feels, and works great! I am very happy with this phone. I get my push everything and it offers most of the apps I used on my iPhone. I learned to live with putting the phone in upside down, and that fixed that first problem, and the battery issue seems to be a problem with all Android devices. If this phone had a larger battery it would have been better, but for the price I can learn to live with it. I can charge the battery with my USB port in my car, so I am going to get a USB cable for my car (to keep in the glove box), for emergencies when my battery dies. I will also add a charging station near my desk to get a charge whenever I am at my desk. This phone works and looks great, there are a few flaws I found, but for the price I can learn to live with them. I am happy with this phone and would recommend it. Sony did a great job with this phone, and the features and feel of this phone make it a great phone!Sony also gives you PC and Mac software for troubleshooting this phone (clean install of Android) and the ability to transfer images, music, videos and everything else to and from your phone. I use Mac OS, and found this software the best way to add music since I can add playlists from iTunes to the phone. The software can be downloaded from Sony Mobile's website. The music player on the phone is also pretty sweet and can download all the music info for you (cover art, and metadata).Also, if you have a problem with the phone Sony offers pretty good support, they offer US phone support (they have it for all different countries, but I only used the US number), the wait time is a bit long, but the people are knowledgeable and will walk you through any problems. They also offer Chat support which I find to be quicker for small questions (this info is on the Sony Mobile website).The phone also comes with a few apps you may want to uninstall (like a game store, and a few music stores from Sony), to uninstall click the little squares symbol on the bottom left of the phone and hit the red X over each app you want to get rid of. You cannot remove them all, but you can easily remove some that you do not need. The Music identifier program that Sony gives you is really nice, so you may want to give it ago.I know this is a long review, but making a phone purchase is a big deal to me, and I spent a lot of time doing research before purchasing this one. If you have any questions on this phone let me know (comments) and I will try to help. It is truly a nice phone, and a few flaws were not enough to make me return it and I have been enjoying it greatly since I got in the habit of it (it was tough switching after having an iPhone for so long). Also, when you get this phone don't forget to install the Amazon App Store, they give you a free app a day, and a couple of days a go I got Angry Birds for free, so they offer some nice apps for free!Also, to let you know Ice Cream Sandwich is not available for this phone yet, Sony says it will be available this year, so hopefully it will be here soon. The current version for this phone is Gingerbread, however, a build approval for this phone's ICS update as been approved so it should not be long (hopefully).UPDATE: After seeing other reviews, I thought I better clarify that the phone has 8GB of internal space. However, like all phones (if you ever had an iPhone you know when you buy a 16GB model you can only use 13GB for data) the OS takes up quite a bit of this, so after the Android OS and all of the software that is added you will have about 4GB available. Internal Memory (last option on the Storage section in Settings), is for Android and is not for holding user files. This will change constantly and will be cleared when the phone is rebooted. The benefit of this phone over the Xperia U is that it supports a Micro SD card, so you can add a Micro SD card and add a lot of space to it. Sony has listed that this phone has 8GB and 5GB available to use that means that 3GB is just for Android and software (although I find that after Sony apps and Android it uses about 4GB), and as you upgrade to newer Android OS and install more apps that will be even lower. This true of any phone. On my phone after installing all of my apps (about 30 of them [games, financial, reference, video streaming, and music streaming and utilities]: I have 3.76GB of available space on my phone and total space was 3.98GB to start with [after upgrading to build: 6.0.B.3.184]. I put most my movies and music on my Micro SD card.UPDATE: After seeing the other review about battery replacement, I thought I better add a little more info on the actual battery. This phone has a removable back cover for adding a Micro SD card and the SIM card, however, the battery is NOT changeable. The battery does not come out and if you need it changed you should send it back to Sony (either through Warranty or general pay per incident support). This is identical to how iPhone works, the battery is not changeable by the user but can be replaced by the manufacture if needed. However, just to mention it, since some people will, there are (like everything) a way to do something that was not meant to be. You can find plenty of videos and tutorials on how to change the battery, however, you are not suppose to and it will most likely void your warranty. This phone's battery is not meant to be changed it cannot be easily removed and is meant to be changed by only Sony. However, like the iPhone it is possible to do it yourself, however, there are great risks and other than issues with warranty you may damage the device if not done right. I would not recommend changing the battery yourself; plus it will probably be hard to find a replacement battery since Sony does not sell them (I personally do not like using non manufacture parts in my devices), and the risk of damaging the device. is not worth the cost of having Sony change the battery."

The phone is right-sized, and with a dual-core processor and 512MB of RAM, it's smart enough for me. Call quality is fine, and the Bluetooth sync for streaming tunes from the Walkman app is crystal clear. Yes, the battery is small, but, if your not a phonaholic, it'll last all day. Kind of a bummer that Sony has decided not support a JB update for the unit, but, hey, I can live with ICS; I'm rather certain xda will develop a JB-like ROM for this processor, and if I ever get a hankerin' to root and boot, I might give it a go.Oh, and, the unit is damn good looking, too."

It's small but sufficient for my own personal use. I'm not on the thing all day long and don't require a bigger screen but I can see how a bigger screen might be better for some. I should add though that the resolution is very good and videos come in bright and clear as well as pictures. I use the MP3 function quite a bit and this works fine. Sound quality is good but I am looking to invest in a nice set of earphones. Battery life could be better but it is a small phone and small phones have small batteries; you get what you pay for here.

It's exceeded my expectations with fast performance. My carrier (Consumer Cellular) helped me set it up. The ICS upgrade has not been released to my phone yet but I haven't seen any big reason to upgrade--(I'm usually reluctant to take an upgrade unless there's something it will let me do which I can't do already). It is available online if you're willing to search a bit you can find instructions online.I use the phone for phone, texting, listening to podcasts, following news, GPS navigation, social media. The one thing missing out of the box is a good speed dial/voice dial but I was able to add these from Google Play.The camera is fine in good light but not so good in low light. The flash isn't very strong. There is no front camera. But of course if you want these features you can pay a bit more and get them. Since they're not that important to me it's great that this phone exists at this price point."

There's always going to be a few issues, and the problems with this phone are (so far) relatively small.PROS:The first thing that stands out is the resolution, the graphics look great! Everything is very crisp, sharp and bright. It is MILES ahead of the iPhone 5. The battery life is pretty good, I use it very heavily and I only have to charge once a day. There is a good amount of internal memory- and room for a micro SD card. There is an overwhelming amount of pre-installed notification tones, ringtones and alarms to choose from. Mine came pre-installed with ICS, (I got a used one from Amazon warehouse) and I really like the new look and feel to the OS. The keyboard is very responsive and easy to use. The speakers are great, speakerphone calls sound very clear and loud.CONS: The biggest one is the glitchy pattern swipe lock. Sometimes it works okay, but most of the time I have to so it over and over because the line will be dancing all over the place. I have looked for a calibration screen to fix the issue, but I couldn't find one. It is only a problem on the pattern unlock screen- otherwise the calibration is fine. I'm also not happy with the changes they made to the SWIPE keyboard. I loved using it in the past, but they updated the looks. Now the line showing the letters you have swiped is significantly bigger than in the past. It obstructs the view of the keyboard. Also before if you manually typed in a word that doesn't exist in the dictionary and it was auto-corrected, you just had to click the word and select your original spelling to change it back. For some reason that doesn't exist in this phone, and you will have to delete the word and retype it.Over all I'm happy with my purchase for the price. I couldn't find whether this phone needed a SIM card or a micro SIM card before and had to wait until it came in. If you're wondering it takes a regular SIM card.UPDATE: It has now been less than a month since I've had this phone and it is completely unusable. EVERYTHING is slow. Waiting to open texts, dialing numbers, turning the screen off, looking through contacts- takes 30 secs to load. It often doesn't load at all and freezes. Since you can't remove the battery and take the poor phone out of its misery I have to stare at the screen for thirty mins while the phone tries its best to figure out whats going on, then it'll finally restart itself. I would not recommend this phone to anyone, I'm very unsatisfied with the money I spent and the quality of the phone. I would like to uninstall ICS, but apparently that is an impossibility. I have lowered the review from 4 stars to 1."

Camera was good at taking macro shots. Battery average. Build of the phone is average. It came with these smart tags which you can use to pre-program certain commands (e.g. airplane mode and set alarm for bedroom, normal mode and show calendar for morning mode, etc.) to your phone after scanning the tags. Dig the glove mode feature with which you can use the touchscreen without actually ""touching"" the screen and comes in handy whenever youre wearing gloves or if your hands are wet or dirty, and you just simply have to place your fingertips within a few cms over the touchscreen and just do ""airswipes"". Actual screen is very clear and easy to read. Sound is nice.Update: I updated two weeks ago to Ice Cream Sandwich despite some reviewers expressed regrets but I was really relieved and happy to find out that the update made my Sola even better in some areas: resolutions more crisp, camera resolution better, and most apps can now be accessed more easily. Apps that have been previously accessed now automatically terminate after several minutes of non-use which helps preserve processor commitments, ram load, and battery reserves. Maybe it helped (per my updating habits with my previous mobiles) that after updating to ICS I immediately did a complete factory reset to restore ICS to its ""virgin settings"" which possibly cleaned out inefficient Gingerbread remnants and unnecessary old app gunk. HOEVER, I did notice that after the uodate, the phone became more sluggish, call signal weaker, and battery now really bad. I contacted Sony since it was under warranty to ask thenm to simply try to do something about the weaker antenna and mailed it in (my expense) and when it was returned to me a few weeks after, nothing hs changed.I wonder what is happening to Sony. Not only are its products becoming increasingly of inferior quality, its customer service is awful."

I've been eligible to upgrade for months now, but see no purpose, the phone I have now (the xperia sola) is the best!Why I got the Xperia Sola-I had an Atrix 4g, and the touch screen digitizer broke repeatedly and I had to replace it a lot. So I wanted to get a phone with a more reliable build quality. After doing some research I'd found that these unlocked Sony phones were built tough, and I really had no idea they were built this amazing!How it holds up-I work outside everyday in Las Vegas, doing landscaping and labor work, so I needed something that could handle extreme conditions. The Sola holds up VERY well. I fell in a pool with the phone, and my first instinct upon getting out of the water was to take the battery and cards out of the Sola. But as you know the Sola has a built in battery, so I thought I was screwed. I WAS WRONG. I put it back facing up without the cover on the dashboard of the work truck for an hour, then like magic IT TURNED ON FULLY FUNCTIONAL. EVERYTHING worked as it did before. I've read that some of the xperia phones of water resistance, but even if its not stated for the Sola, it holds its own.Battery life-Like I said I work outside all day, from 6am-4pm, so I need something that can play music and keep me in touch throughout the day. I can listen to the FM radio on the phone all day and have 20% battery leftover that can keep it going until midnight with light/moderate use. Amazing battery life compared to my old phones.Hardware-3.7"" screen is the perfect size. Camera is okay. FM radio is awesome. I've never had any problems with the touch screen digitizer. Buy some screen protectors though it can get scratched up pretty good. Dual core 1ghz is perfect, and I do web development on the go. The NVIDIA video processor makes everything look swag. RAM is sufficient, onboard storage is good too, but I popped in a 32gb expansion which works great.Firmware/Software-Firmware blows away other manufacture/stock firmware. So much that I didn't even TRY to unlock the bootloader and load custom ROMS, and I love custom roms. It's perfect stock. I'm running gingerbread but they make it look like ICS, you can update it manually but i've heard it slows it down (it should work fine if you clear the caches and flash a clean stock before updating though).>> Walkman music app is so sick I love itCall quality/ Signal strength-Carrier im using is AT&T, and you can plug the sim in and make/recieve phone calls, but to use the internet/mms you need to input some server addresses to settings.For entering APN settingsGo to Settings > Wireless and Networks > Mobile Network Settings > Access Point NamesThen hit the physical menu button to pull up the hidden menu with the option of add APNGoogle your carriers APN data or copy from a friends phone like I did lol"

Suffice to say you're getting a medium priced cell-phone with all expectable addons (GPS, FM radio, digital camera and so on) and that the device is aesthetically beautiful. More on the hardware later anyway.It's the software which is not in line here. I came from a middle-priced Samsung (Galaxy ACE) and was supposedly ""up""grading to this device. It might have been an upgrade from the hardware standpoint, but definitely a downgrade on the software side. Android's not to blame, because both devices came standard with Android 2.3. It's the manufacturer's customization of the OS what makes the difference. A few examples:-- Destktop: You can't add/remove main desktops. 5 is all you have, no less, no more. Also, you can't jump from desktop #5 to desktop #1 without passing thru desktops #2, #3, #4. My previous Samsung allowed me both to add/remove desktops as I needed them and direct jumping from the last desktop to the first in both directions.-- Lock screen: There's the usual ""lock"" screen to which you can add a password for additional privacy, but here's the problem: when you grab your phone and it's obviously locked, you have to both unlock the phone (slide the lockpad) AND write the password. Two steps instead of just the single step of writing the password.-- Under-desktops: well, I made up this name as I don't know how to call them, but I'm referring here to the wallpaper-less desktops in which you can find all your aplications. There's no limit to these (theoretically) as they are progressively added as you install new applications. The number of these can easily increase and normally the latest apps are to be found in the latest desktops. Now, here's the flaw: Each time you do anything in, say, underdesktop #7 (like putting a shortcut in one of the normal desktops) you go back to underdesktop #1. So, if you want to place 6 shortcuts of your latest installed apps in one of the main desktops, well, you'll have to navigate 6 times from underdesktop #1 to underdesktop #7-- The above is a standard for everything. Whatever I could do with 2-3 touches in my Samsung, I need 6-10 touches in this Sony.-- 3G control: you can turn on/off the 3G, but you can't limit the connection speed. ""Why would anyone want this?"" you might ask. Well, 3G at maximum speed is also a maximum battery drainer. For 24/7 online applications like WhatsApp and others that consume little bandwidth, you don't really need full-speed 3G (aka HDSPA) and you can save battery by limiting your connection to 2G (EDGE). Again, Samsung allowed for this possibility.-- Text editing: selecting, cutting, copying text to carry between applications could've been easier-- Contacts. In my Samsung I went to the contact list. If I slide a contact to the right, the phone automatically called that contact, if I slide it to the left, the phone prepares an SMS. I can't do that with this Sony, I have to ""get into"" the contact, then select the action. Not a big deal apparently, but when time after time you find yourself touching the phone a great number of extra times, it's a pain.-- Last example: GPS. It refuses to work unless you grant Google the permission to track your steps, which implies an internet connection (besides the privacy concern). To some out there this may seem natural, perhaps they think the GPS hardware is somehow interwined with Google Maps in such a way that they can't function separately. The truth is that they are distinct things and there are apps out there (Navigator for instance) which allow use of the GPS without an online connection. Well, big-bro Sony has crossed out this possibility in this phone.Now, I'm not saying that my previous Samsung was better, nor am I endorsing this brand. Had I not have the previous experience I probably wouldn't have noticed all of the above. But the truth of the matter is that I have it, so the comparisson is inevitable and Samsung made things... I don't want to say ""easier"" because that's subjective, but I will say a lot faster (shorter, less touches per action). On the positive side I will mention the camera and the radio: both apps are great in the Sola. The camera has plenty of modes you can use, including 3D pictures, swipe panorama (you can produce photo-stich like 360 panoramas without ever using any extra software). The FM radio is very nice and intuitive, far better than the Samsung.At this point you might ask: why not upgrade to Android 4.0 (or 4.1)? Well, there's plenty of reports about this system being a battery drainer and for me, the cellphone has to endure a day under moderate use. Sony is also very cautious on its webpage about this ""upgrade"" operation, not endorsing it but rather offering it on a tone of ""well son, if you really-really-really want 4.0 then follow these steps... [...] ...and be warned that there's no turning back option""Enough of the software now. I took some time to comment on it because it's often overlooked, but it's ultimately what you'll be interacting with most of the time, it's what's gonna make your everyday experience with the phone. If the camera takes 3Mpx or 8Mpx photos is secondary.But for the sake of completition I will now add specific comments on the hardware:--Battery: I find claims of the battery not enduring to be exagerated. First off, you need to understand that these devices may still be called ""phones"" for historical reasons, but they are actually computers. At such size, it's a miracle that a dual-core @1GHz processor can endure 10 hours. Now, if you careless leave the GPS on, Bluetooth on, 3G *AND* WiFi on, set the screen to maximum brightness, and on top of this you upgrade to Android v.4, don't expect the battery to go along with your ambitions. But if you play it conservative and turn on only the features you specifically need at each moment (including 3G *XOR* WiFi) battery will be acceptable. By this I mean that you can leave home with a fully charged phone and return at night with the phone still performing.--Videos: I've played 720p movie videos and I can notice they are right on the limit of this phone's capabilities, but they play ok. Filming in 720p is also possible but expect some jitter (both recording and playing back), especially if you record to the external SD card, and super-especially if you keep ""face-detection"" ON while you're filming.--Camera button: this supposedly dedicated button, as many have already stated, is a practical joke (maybe a hardware easter egg from Sony?). Utterly useless. Why? Because you need to press it so hard that its very purpose loses all sense. What's astonishing is that it isn't necessarily a design flaw. It's not that the phone doesn't ""detect"" the press until you go too hard. The phone actually detects your pressing rather quickly, but it does something akin to fixing the focus, but it doesn't take the shot. You're expected press further down (5X harder) for the shot to be finally taken. Some digital cameras (Canon's for instance) have this functionallity in which the main button has 2 positions: focus and shot. The problem with the Sola is that the force you have to exert to reach that 2nd position is so violent that you succeed at the expense of shaking the camera and/or hurting the tip of your finger.--Camera LED: Can't be taken too seriously as a flash, but to be honest I don't know any phone that does. On the other hand, when used as a flashlight it's very intense. I've used it a lot in real situations and it delivers.--Camera (overall): hard button aside, the camera itself is powerful and takes beautiful snapshots (and as I've said, the camera software excels).--Speaker: there's a powerful speaker on the back of the phone; powerful and also aesthetically beautiful."

I've had the phone for a month and I think it is visually appealing, easy to use, had a decent price-point, and works with my cell phone plan. I like the size and weight, compared to an iphone it is quite a bit lighter, which I like. I believe another review didn't care for the back cover, I purchased the Incipio case and it is perfect for me. The screen is easy to read and well-lit. The android system has been pretty intuitive and the documentation that Sony provides is very easy to find, read and understand. The downside (and I think this is any smartphone including the iphone) is that you are charging a lot - at least daily. I haven't tried out the smart tags yet, but am looking forward to using them. It has some nice features built-in such as the swipe to text and voice to text. I have an ipod already for music so I have not tried using it for listening to music, however Sony provides an application to store music and other media on a pc similar to using itunes and makes it easy to transfer and update the phone."

Camera quality is nice, the only thing I'd argue about is the LED flash light which isn't very helpful if there's no good lighting. The phone works fine, at a nice speed and its easy to handle. The only trouble I've had so far is that about 2 or 3 times the keybord has got kind of stuck and wont write, but then the failure will correct itself after a few seconds wait.

If I hand't read the hardware specs, I would have guess this phone had a 600MHz single core ARM chip in it, not a dual core 1GHz.

Sony however promised an update to ICS for the Sola, and so I decided to get it and wait for the update.The phone worked decently on Gingerbread, but please understand that this review was based on the premise that Sony promised me an official update to ICS, and THAT is what convinced me to purchase the phone, otherwise I wouldn't have.Having said that, ICS has slowed down the performance of the phone significantly. Simple functions like dialing and receiving calls have started to take an eternity. I've tried everything (short of reverting to Gingerbread, which would defeat my purpose of purchasing the phone, and is a confusing task in its own right for the technically challenged) from task killers to custom roms, but the performance is still poor.It's led me to disable a lot of simple features I purchased the phone for, like widgets, live wallpaper and certain apps that run in the background (like Viber).The memory management is poor, as at any given time it averages less than 50mb, and that's thanks to the task killer.The camera (both before AND after the update), takes about 5-10 seconds to take a picture (trying to auto-focus), all while the poor subject has to bear with the LED blinding them. Most pictures with flash ends up with a lot of squinting eyes.I have a backup phone, branded Alcatel, which uses Gingerbread, that runs about the same speed as my Sola now. Of course, it's less than quarter the price. I'm just saying this for comparison sake.I find it hard to recommend a phone where updates (official ones at that) should be avoided."

I uninstalled almost ALL my apps, phone was running bare bones, Erased SD card, have NEVER played any games on it, the only media I have is news apps. The phone still takes half a minute to load, the camera a full minute and the music player.... this is the kicker........... 7 minutes. And my SD card had only 30 mb of music!So I did a factory reset, as per the advice on the sony support forums. Except it didn't work. The phone is stuck on an infinite start up loop and after wasting 3 hours on trying to fix this, I'm sending it back. Very frustrated.I'm really tempted to say never again to sony, but I've used Sony all my life. I still have a stereo, a walkman and a discman from Sony.That caused me to give them 1 more chance. Hey, maybe that piece was faulty. It happens.Will try the replacement piece and update.

However, after putting in my SIM card and using it for a little I quickly discovered major issues between the phone and my service provider AT&T. Getting MMS messaging to work was a nightmare. I'm pretty sure launching a space shuttle has less input codes. After spending 30 mins on the phone with SONY xperia help line nothing was resolved. I then called AT&T to set up an APN to attempt to get MMS to work properly. Hour later and nothing. Apparently the phone was built for T-Mobile and Sprint as well and for one reason or another AT&T could not properly register the phone to allow to receive MMS. Another issue that I noted immediately and many others have as well is the WIFI. It drops every 10 minutes if that and puts a big ! mark in the corner of the phone every time it happens.

"391254","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Black (US Warranty)",5,"Sony gets a lot of flak for this phone using the 650 chipset but honestly I am glad they did. There are no heat issues and the phone is blazing fast. Being a compact the phone feels great in the hand and there is no more ""hand shimmy"" needed to get to everything on the screen. Not to mention that it doesn't take up all of your pocket real estate if you like keeping your phone in the front. Needless to say the battery life is also amazing. This will get you through all day usage and then some even if you watch a movie or two on netflix. If your looking for a solid one hander with great performance and long battery life this is it."
"391255","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Black (US Warranty)",3,"I have problems with the phone. Only work for one day and I called Sony to help me but they could not. So at this point I need to return the phone"
"391256","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Black (US Warranty)",5,"I have a small palm and short fingers, it fits perfectly. Feels very solid and looks very pleasing. Love the UI experience."
"391257","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Black (US Warranty)",4,"Since most others have already reviewed the major specs, I'll just touch on the two features that I was the most curious about but no one else seemed to review.Camera speed: So I'm a pet parent, and as every pet parent knows, shutter speed is extremely important when it comes to catching that oh-so-cute face your pup or kitty (I have both) are making at you before they ruin it with a yawn or getting distracted by a squirrel. My last phone (Galaxy SIII) was super quick at taking photos, even if they were blurred from the motion. I decided against the Xperia Z5 compact because of all the reviews on the slow camera speed. The X Compact appears to load the camera much quicker than what I saw in videos for the Z5 Compact, especially if you load by double clicking the power button. (it's a slower load via the dedicated camera button.) The shutter speed, however, is quicker than my husband's Xperia Z3 flagship, but still slower than my Galaxy S III. Even so, the auto focus does act pretty quickly, and it seems quicker the better the lighting is. The picture quality is pretty good, though, except that the colors are on the bluish side in dim lighting.Speakerphone quality: How is it 2016 and speakerphone quality is worse than before?! Maybe it's a Sony problem. Husband's Z3 is barely audible on speakerphone, and the X Compact made only slight improvement. It's audible when it's dead quiet around you, but less so when I'm walking the dog outside, and near impossible when I'm in the car. What's the big deal about these front facing speakers if I can't hear the other person very well?! (note: speakers seem to be great for playing videos and games.)Phone still gets 4 stars because of all the other nice features everyone else had already reviewed. But wanted to share about those two points since they are not often talked about."
"391258","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Black (US Warranty)",5,"Sexy, sexy phone! Camera needs some patience, but end results are wonderful!"
"391259","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Black (US Warranty)",4,"If you are looking for a mid sized phone you can use with one hand in October of 2016 this phone is your best option.Pros:- Phone fits in one hand- Battery life lasts all day and in some cases two days- Phone works great on T-mobile's network while also having band 12 for faster LTE (Works well on AT&T too)- UI is smooth and doesn't lag with a minimalist skin over stock android- No overheating issues like z5 compact- Android 7.0 N due to release in November- USB C with quick charge 3.0- Expandable memory- Front facing speakersCons- Plastic doesn't feel as premium like the s7 and iphone 7- Fairly thick for a phone made in 2016- Camera is adequate but has trouble in low light and tends to overexpose in daylight- No amoled display- Volume buttons are too low although they function well when using the camera- No fingerprint sensor with US version- No waterproofing- Black is more of a dark blueIt's unfortunate that the market is saturated with so many phablets and we have very little choice when it comes to conservatively sized devices but all in all I think this is a good phone that you won't regret buying if you are wanting a moderately sized phone"
"391260","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Black (US Warranty)",3,"I got it in ""Midnight Black"" They should have called it Navy Blue!? Why Sony? It bugs me, because it really is blue. I own both Xperia Z3 and Z5 and I think I'll send the XC back. It's very nice, comfortable to hold and the buttons are a little more out of the way. But the processor is faster on the Z5 and the rest of the specs aren't hugely different. If it was only truly black I'd probably keep it although there is a lot of plastic on it."
"391261","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Black (US Warranty)",3,"This phone is basically the same as Sony Xperia Z5 Compact. Only upside: 1GB more ram. Downsides: not waterproof, slower processor, USB-C instead of standard Micro-USB, more expensive.At this price point Z5 Compact international model (that has fingerprint scanner) feels like a much better purchase."
"391262","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Black (US Warranty)",5,"Starting off, I'm coming from a Nexus 5 (2013) and I primarily got this phone because the Nexus was getting a bit long in the tooth, so this is a big jump for me in terms of phones and I think it's great overall. I chose the X Compact (over, let's say, the new Moto phones or the Pixel phones about to come out) primarily due to its smaller size as well as its design (though the X Compact was definitely in the upper limit of what I was willing to pay for a new phone); I rather enjoy the simple, clean design of it with the curves along the long edges. Looking at just the specs, it does seem overpriced (I got this at a pretty nice deal, though), but I ultimately enjoy the purchase.My pros and cons are coming from a user that doesn't play games, nor watch too many videos or listen to music too much. I just use it for chatting with friends and communicating with co workers (e.g. text, e-mail, etc), and browsing everyone's favorite news aggregator. Sprinkle in some photo taking, reading the news, and that's pretty much all I use my smartphone for, so my expectations are set accordingly.Pros:+ Clean, simple design with a nice color+ Nice pocketable size+ 720p screen looks great+ Speedy performance for what I need/want+ Dual front facing speakers+ Camera seems nice (I haven't tested it too rigorously yet, however)+ Good battery life (easily lasts me a day with 40% left, but again, I'm not a heavy user)+ Fast charging, and USB C is nice (though I guess I have to get an adapter for all my micro USB chargers)+ Great, lightly skinned Android with 7.0 Nougat updates confirmed (albeit sometime in November, I think?)I can't think of too many cons since I'm not exactly the pickiest, and I'm still in the honeymoon stage with this phone.Cons:- Bit expensive for the hardware you get compared to other phones- Some bloatware that can't be uninstalled, but you can hide them from your apps drawer- Speakers aren't the loudest- Not too many accessories out yet (e.g. cases, screen protectors)Again, I really like this phone, but if you're looking for a phone with top of the line specs or something of comparable specs to this one at a lower price point, you may want to look elsewhere (e.g. OnePlus 3, Moto G4 family, Nexus 5X/6P, etc). I'll try to update this in a month or two, however, when I can probably be a bit more discerning. Hope this helps!"
"391263","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Black (US Warranty)",4,"I use this phone for few hours and found how fast the battery dies after my iPhone SE. But this is not the biggest problem (I assume I'll not use so hard phone in next days). There is no WiFi calling on T-Mobile and may be VoLTE on this phone. At least, I couldn't find it...Updated WiFi: thanks to comments and also talked to T-Mobile representative - WiFi calling is not SONY's problem. So, I'm adding one more star to Sony, take one from T-Mobile :)"
"391264","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Black (US Warranty)",5,"This phone is very sleek and beautiful, it's fast and does everything it supposed to without lagging. It's a good phone for the price. However, it's a big annoying that Sony doesn't send out headphones with the phone, but that's alright. It comes with the faster charging wall plug, and I've noticed that the phone does charge way faster when it's connected to the plug. The speakers on this phone aren't the best, they're ok though. Not very loud, but they are clear sounding. The cameras are not that good in low light, but everything else about the phone is an A+."
"391265","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Black (US Warranty)",5,"Love it.It's a great sizeUI is fastBattery life is excellent (usually use 30-50%/day)Screen is very good, don't let the releativly low resolution be a deterent, it's quite good even looking at very small detail.The built-in Sony apps can be somewhat annoying and not all can be uninstalled, but just hide them in a folder and turn off notification and they dont bother you.My only concerns are more with Andriod than anything Sony did. The privacy controls are insuffient, too much reliancy on google and it's qutie a hassle to disable cloud based data sharing. (On the positive side you don't need any relationship with Sony to use everything, a Sony account and cloud services can be skipped on startup and settings).As others have noted, this is the US SKU. That means it's missing 2 features: 1 no fingerprint reader, and 2 no smart battery control. Most people know about the first one, but the lack of smart battery control is hidden in the manual. This means no ""learning your habits"" and charging a less than a max speed. Because of this I don't plugin my phone overnight because I don't want it to charge to 100% or do so at a rapid speed, both of which lessen your battery life in the long term."

"391267","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Black (US Warranty)",5,"I recently purchased the White US version of the X Compact for $350 after a great two years with this phone’s grandfather the Z3C. After debating whether to purchase the X Compact, Galaxy S7, Google Pixel and Honor 8, I’m quite happy with my decision. There have been some extremely critical reviews of the device - discrediting it as no longer being the compact flagship, but for the niche market that enjoys small-form factor android phones, the device is top of class. This review will highlight some of the unique features that I’ve encountered as well as addressing some of the harsh criticisms I’ve seen in other reviews.Design:I’ve always been a fan of Sony’s clean and minimalist design language for its Xperia line and this phone is no exception. In a market where every phone seems to have a utilitarian brushed metal or flashy, shiny design, the white model of this phone is a refreshing change. The looped edges (which are very akin to the Lumia Windows Phones) and small size of the device offer the perfect dimensions for one handed operation without performing a balancing act with your fingers. The 2.5D curved glass that seamlessly loops into to back of the unit which offers a unique feeling I’ve never experienced. The phone also does a great job of catching the light in interesting ways and it's been the first phone I’ve used that has literally turned heads when walking down the street.Build:Many people have been really harsh on this phone for having a plastic rear. While it is true that it can be easily scratched, I think Sony has gracefully addressed one of the biggest complaints of their previous lines while keeping true to their design aesthetic. Let me explain: the two predecessors to this phone, the Z3C and Z5C both had glass panels on the rear of the phone. While elegant and more scratch resistant than plastic, the phones were prone to spontaneous cracking, even while in a case. Sony could have gone the route of using a metal back, but at the cost of poor reception or having a plastic chin (like the Xperia XZ), but it would go against their clean slab design language they’ve retained for the previous lines. As someone who has always used his phone with a case or a skin, having the plastic back is not a problem for me.Another pain-point with this phone has been the lack of waterproofing that the Xperia line has become iconic for. After seeing videos online of people verifying the waterproofing and testing for myself, I can confirm that this phone is in fact waterproof. I can’t make any claims for the actual ingress rating, but I’ve been able to use my phone in the shower everyday since purchasing the phone without problems. My theory is the Sony omitted waterproofing as a an on-paper feature for this phone because it new that labor costs of repairing warranty claims for the device would not be cost effective for the volume sold to the US and UK markets, where larger devices reign supreme. If that isn’t evidence enough, the X Compact in Asian markets have the waterproof rating where smaller phones are more popular and where Sony has more resources to make warranty claims.The final pain-point I’ve seen with this phone is the fact that the US version does not have a fingerprint scanner. It does indeed have a fingerprint scanner, but because of a patent conflict with Hewlett-Packard, Sony had to disable it for the US markets. If you’re willing to get your hands dirty with android development, you can actually download and install the signed, UK firmware of the phone to enable the fingerprint scanner. As a plus, since the firmware is official and signed by Sony, you will not lose your warranty if you conduct the procedure. And what a fingerprint scanner it is. The scanner is extremely accurate, placed in the perfect position and unlocks my phone before I even I can even pull it out of my pocket.As for the rest of the phone, the device has the signature dual front facing speakers that are a huge improvement from the Z3C speakers. They won’t wow anyone with their loudness, but they’re perfect having crisp clean audio for sharing media with friends. The camera button is always welcomed and has a tactile dual click to allow focus lock before capture when taking pictures. The volume controls, on the other hand are in an awkward place. Sony has a tendency to place the volume buttons close to the camera shutter for use as a zoom keys, but I’ve noticed that I more often than not pinch the screen to zoom in so I would love to see those keys moved to the upper-left side of the device.Display:This is hands down one of the most gorgeous displays I have ever used. I’ve held this phone up to a Google Pixel (which has an AMOLED screen) and this device can go toe-to-toe with the Pixel’s Brightness and Saturation despite having a LCD panel screen. It's absolutely incredible how beautiful the display is. The colors are juicy and watching movies on the device is. That being said,unfortunately because it is an LCD panel it cannot achieve the absolute blackness that an AMOLED screen can. For me, it’s not noticeable enough to bother me but I can see how that could be an issue for people coming from AMOLED devices.Many people have been hyper-critical of the fact that this phone uses a 720p display in 2016. A 720p display is perfect for a display this size. iPhones have had similar resolutions for years without any complaint. Here is a comparison with the current gen iPhone handsets:iPhone SE: 4.0inch Screen at 1136 x 640 (320 pixels per inch)X Compact: 4.6inch Screen at 1280 x 720 (319 pixels per inch)iPhone 7: 4.7inch Screen at 1334 x 750 (326 pixels per inch)Yes, you can get Android phones with 400+ pixels per inch, but why have a screen that is more demanding on performance and battery life if you can’t even discern the individuals with the naked eye? Sony has realized this and chose the optimum screen for the form factor.Performance:Many people have criticized the fact that this device uses a Snapdragon 650 Processor instead of an 820 like its big brother. I think Sony chose this processor for a couple reasons. The smaller resolution of the X Compact means that similar rendering performance can be achieved with a scaled back processor. The 650 is also more power efficient than its big brother, which allows it to achieve the ludicrous battery life that the Compact line is known for. Yes this phone might not have the same raw performance numbers as some of the other top of the line phones on the market, but I have yet to experience any hiccups in any applications I’ve tried. And at the end of the day, isn’t that what really matters?Photo-Quality:This is still one of the primary reasons why I buy Sony phones. Sony devices have one of the most powerful imaging devices for android - if you know how to dial in the settings. The 23 MP Camera allows for fidelity I’ve never been able to achieve in any phone I’ve tried. The camera app has all of the controls you’d expect from a DSLR, but in a compact size. One of the biggest improvements from the previous camera app is the ability to control shutter speed now. Also, compared to the Z3C, the automatic mode is much better at finding the right settings for the current scene. Handheld and low-light pictures are also much clearer thanks to the new laser auto-focus and improved capture speed. I can speak for the camera all day long, but I’ll just attach some pictures so you can see for yourself.Battery Life:This is the most battery efficient smart phone I’ve ever used. My usage habits typically involve using GPS and streaming music on my way to work, checking social media, news and dating apps throughout the day, photo taking in the afternoon and casting media in the evening. I would consider myself someone with heavy use with the exception of playing 3D games. I’ve been able to go from 8am to 10pm with over 40% battery left without any active battery saving features.I’ve always been a huge fan of Sony’s built in battery saving features. I’ve tested the device with Stamina Enabled for the full duration of the battery and a more normal usage pattern, and it is a breeze to get up to 3 full days of use. If you want to stretch it even further, you can turn on Ultra Stamina Mode which turns off all your apps sans the basic. With that mode enabled, my phone has predicted that it can go up to 2 weeks.Software:Sony’s build of android is almost entirely stock save a couple of power saving features and some bloatware. Sony’s own included apps have varying degrees of use. Sony makes one of the best Album apps I’ve used but things like LifeLog, Xperia Lounge and What’s New I could do without. As for the third party software, Sony actually includes some useful ones including Amazon Shopping and Swiftkey. Luckily if there is anything you don’t like, you can easily disable any apps you don’t like.Accessories:One of the biggest downfalls for the device is the accessory support. Two things I usually buy when I get a new phone are a tempered glass screen protector and a Ringke Fusion Case. Because of the negative reception to the phone and low volume, many of the common accessory manufacturers have elected to pass up this device in their production line up. In my attempts to find a screen protector, I’ve been unable to find any that have a complete adhesive hold to the entire screen; the screen protectors either omit the curved edges or screen protectors that only attach from adhesive on the edges, leaving a noticeable air gap between the screen and protector. Thus, I’ve had to resort to using Skinomi’s screen protector in the interim. Unfortunately Ringke does not have any plans to make their Fusion case for this device, but I was able to find the MicroP TPU case which achieves some similar design aesthetics as the Ringke cases.TLDR:Pros:- Beautiful design- Small form factor phone- Beautiful display- Fast fingerprint sensor- Unofficial but present waterproofing- Insane battery life- Great cameraCons:- Very little accessory support (Cases / screen protectors)- Activating fingerprint sensor requires some tinkering- Volume buttons in an awkward location for use with volumeVerdict:The Xperia X Compact is one of the best options if you’re looking for a small form factor phone with an excellent camera and battery life. This phone does have its fair share of nuances that make it less approachable than offerings by Samsung, Xiaomi and Google, but with a little work you can turn the device into an absolute pleasure to use."
"391268","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Black (US Warranty)",5,"I chose this phone because of it's smaller, more portable size, and it has worked perfectly so far. It has many new, up to date features with the same reliability as any other android. Shipping was fast and efficient, and the box comes with everything you need to get started. This is a great phone from a great company, and I would recommend it to anyone!"
"391269","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Black (US Warranty)",4,"This phone is great and simple to work. I bought it to replace my Japanese phone that the company wouldn't allow me to upgrade. The only issue with this cell phone is it is not Japan certified so mobile data does not work with it."
"391270","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Black (US Warranty)",5,"The Sony compact series has always been my go to for an Android phone because of the size and speed. The previous compacts were based on the latest and greatest highest end chip set at the time of their releases. When this phone was announced as having the SD 650, I was more than disappointed so I wrote the phone off. I wasn't sure which phone to get so I bought an iPhone 7 which lasted a couple weeks until I remembered how restricted ios was. I then had three options for a smallish phone. The Honor 8.. Still a little large, the Google pixel.. Expensive! and the Sony X compact. I had all three within about a month. I kept the X compact. Yep that's right. I gave up the greatest from Google and a very premium made Honor 8. The reason?Number 1-the feel and size are just right. Its just a joy to use and carry.Number 2- i immediately realized that this phone is just as fast as the z5 compact and I'm not sure what they did but this phone is silky smooth, almost iphone like. You have some hang ups like every other Android like in the play Store but overall I am really impressed with the performance. That just shows that specs are not everything and there is something to be said for real optimization.Number - 3 price. It was dropped to $399 when I bought mine. Compared to the pixel, it's half the price.I'm no Camara guru so I can't really speak on this too much but it does take some real nice shots in good light. Low light will not be the best.Many people are bashing because the phone isn't waterproof but it doesn't bother me.*edit. It's frustrating when someone gives one star and is not even talking about this phone!! The X compact does NOT have a cover for the USB!!!! This proves that the reviewer is ignorant. Amazon needs to monitor these reviews better!!"
"391271","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Black (US Warranty)",4,"This is by no means a perfect phone but this is really the best you can get for a small android phone. Almost all the phone manufacturers have dismissed making a small phone in favor of their 5+ inch slabs. I started using androids with a Moto X 2013, which to me was the perfect 4.7 inch phone if you disregard the crappy camera that it had. Unfortunately, Motorola decided bigger is better with their later models, and now the their Chinese overlords that currently own them have pretty much stated that they have no plans of making a small phone again. In fact, they have gone full retard with them making their current phones even bigger and wider.After the Moto X started slowing down after a few drops and age, I ""upgraded"" to the new Moto G 2015, which was not too bad in terms of screen height at 5 inches, but the width of this tubby made it hard to handle with one hand. Not to mention that is was a downgrade from the beautiful AMOLED screen from the Moto X. My camera and LED light crapped out after I dropped my Moto G so I got the Xperia X Compact after some research.Now the nice things about this phone:- Screen: I'm not much of a high res snob but 720p works for this size and it looks much better than my Moto G which had that resolution for 5 inches. Just wish this was an AMOLED for those nice dark blacks.- Memory: I've felt no slowdowns as far as RAM when multitasking. For regular storage you have 32GB which is enough for most people but you can also expand it 256 GB more with a micro SD.- Camera: Best camera that I've had which is not saying much given what my previous phones are. Other people would probably be more credible than me since I never but too much importance on this function but these pictures do look sweet.- Speed: Feels a hell of a lot snappier than my previous phone which is really no surprise with the superior processor. Apparently, the lower resolution gives it a faster speed than say a 1080p would.- Button placement: Yes, I actually like where the sound buttons are placed. I use my phones left handed (even though I'm right handed) and the button placement for volume is actually not awkward as it would be for a right handed user. This doubles as a convenient zoom in and out button for the camera.- Double front facing speakers: A rarity these days, especially for this phone size. Very high quality audio too.-Battery life: About 40-60% at the end of a day which is pretty good for me but this will depend on the person and what apps they are using.Not so great things:- Exterior design: Could have used a more matte, less slippery design. Shows fingerprints. All this can be fixed with a skin but this should not have been necessary. Ergonomics are inferior to the curved Motorola and Samsung designs for handling, while this did improve from the previous blocky Sony phones by curving the sides, they could have done better.Price: This isn't too bad now that Sony has put down the crack pipe and lowered the price from their initial 500 dollar tag.Neutral things:- Lack of fingerprint scanner: This can actually be enabled by reflashing to the UK version which is what I did. Does appear to show less bars on reception as mentioned by a previous reviewer but the connection seems to work just fine. Would not recommend doing this for everyone but do it at your own risk or just buy the international version.-No waterproofing: More accurately, this is not warrantied as being waterproof. YouTube videos have shown that this is actually pretty water resistant and that Sony most likely just doesn't want to cover claims.Say what you will about Sony, while they are deserving of much criticism for their reported crappy customer service and overpricing of their phones, they are the only ones in the android market that are meeting a neglected segment by making a decent phone that is easy to handle one handed, that has a near stock android feel, and actually has the back and recent keys on the correct sides (looking at you Samsung).Note: Still in early ownership and will update if there are any snags."
"391272","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Black (US Warranty)",5,"I wanted a smaller phone than my last one (One Plus). This one is the perfect size for me. Small enough to fit in my pocket, but not so small you can't do anything on it. I really like the light blue color. So far, I have no complaints (I've had it for about a month). It takes great pictures too! I am very happy with my purchase."

"391275","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Black (US Warranty)",4,"I've only had it a few days, so if I can remember I'll return to update this review some weeks from now. Thus far, I'm loving this little thing.On the outside, this thing is a really sleek device. I dislike the fingerprint magnet nature of the surface but it's not that big a deal to me. Aside from that, it feels substantive and of good quality despite being made of plastic. The screen is fantastic; the size and resolution, the colors, the brightness. I love it having USB type C, even if it is still at USB 2.0 speeds. While also on the thicker size (9.5 mm if I recall correctly), it still feels diminutive and nice in the hand. The camera... I'm mixed about. I tried taking some seemingly easy auto photos and got somewhat bad results, whereas my Lumia 950 and Honor 8 produced some consistently great shots. Like the Lumia 950, I LOVE that this has a shutter button.On the inside, the Snapdragon 650 positively *sings* on this paired with 3 GB RAM. Everything is so quick, speedy, and nicely animated. Software seems to be just about stock Android 6.0 and it shows. Battery life so far has been great, but that largely depends on the radios and whatever signal strength you're getting on a given day (seems better than the 950 or Honor 8, truthfully).Of significant note since this is the US model: THE FINGERPRINT SENSOR IS STILL THERE, BUT DISABLED THROUGH SOFTWARE. I was able to get the UK version of the software onto this one and it actually works. Search for it; there should be a thread on XDA forums that explains it. There is a perceived drop in cell reception (going from 5 bars and LTE indicator in the US to 4 bars and simple 4G indicator in the UK). It's odd, just earlier I was browsing the internet with great speed on only 1 bar of 4G; this leads me to believe that 1.) 4G here can indicate LTE but just doesn't show it, and 2.) one bar of '4G' isn't actually all that bad. Again, this is with the UK software. Great experience so far! (:"
"391276","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Black (US Warranty)",4,"I purchased this phone about two weeks ago. This is my first android phone after switching from an iPhone 6. I've been pleasantly surprised by the phone so far. The andorid version on it seems decent and it works pretty well. The battery life is similar to my iPhone 6, with slightly better life when making phone calls and worse when doing a lot of data heavy tasks in facebook, twitter, google plus, email programs and browsing. It makes it easily through a day for me.Most of my issues so far have not been with the phone itself, but rather other services I want to use.For example, I haven't had any luck getting the AT&T visual voicemail app working with this phone. This was one of the few killer iOS features i miss and I feel like it should be built into android rather than apps for each phone company that suck and have a whitelist. This isn't sony's fault aside from their lack of a deal with any major carier in the US.The second issue is a lack of decent cases for the phone. Most of the ones on amazon so far have been cheap, soft cases that don't really hold up well. The screen protectors work as I had a drop the other day and it did take a chunk out of the protector but the phone is fine. I think I'm spoiled from owning an iphone for so many years, but a decent leather case would be much appreciated. Sony should offer some kind of case for it at least or make a deal for them.Finally, the text messaging app that is default with the phone isn't very good. This is easy to fix on android, but then I wasn't sure what to use. Many apps support it and I didn't see a feature matrix to know what to use. In this case, I think sony should consider a better default messaging app.The camera on the phone is decent, but I had hoped for a bit more. It's not as good in darker rooms as my iPhone was. It's also very bad when there is a lot of motion. For the price difference, this isn't a deal breaker for me but if you're really into photos this might not be the phone for you.A lot of people have asked me about the phone and commented on the appearance. Many people are impressed by the screen quality. I was as well. It's quite vivid.I do wish sony would fix their policy about not offering fingerprint scanning in the US. I miss that from my iphone.Another small headache was that contact imports were a problem. AT&T offered a tool to migrate and it was great for photos but only could grab 75 contacts. I had around 300. I ended up doing an export from icloud and then importing using google's contacts website. Most instructions online assume that you have a GMAIL account associated with google. In my case, I have a non google email account and it required finding this contacts site to actually work. The google site also cleaned up some duplicates from the AT&T import which was nice. Sony also has an app which I didn't try for contacts. It may have worked better. I'd recommend people just go right for the google site approach, especially if they don't need pictures imported.The location services are a bit buggy. I have it set to unlock my phone if it is at my house and it doesn't work sometimes. I don't know if that is an android issue or the phone GPS. The iphone was smart enough to realize if i was near my wifi i was home. I wish this phone understood that.Lastly, I had some issues with email. The stock app can connect to regular IMAP accounts fine. It works good for that. I also had a work GMAIL account with a custom domain and an exchange email account for grad school email. I didn't even try to use gmail from that app so I can't comment on that. I setup google gmail app. However, on my old iphone i had all but work mail setup in apple mail. With this phone, if i try to use exchange it tries to lock down the phone and won't allow any other email accounts to be setup. If I use microsoft outlook app, it works fine. I think this is a combination of a domain setup fail and the app. It shouldn't require those strict limitations on the email app if outlook works! This means I have 3 different mail programs to check 4 accounts. Kind of annoying."

"391278","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Black (US Warranty)",3,"The phone itself is fine; the camera does well with moving subjects and low light situations. The bloatware is worse than Nexus or Motorola/Moto devices, but closer to stock Android than any other carrier's. The sound is great, and though the screen was a little hard to get used to after using a larger phone, being able to comfortably use a phone with one hand again really is pretty nice. I can't speak to how it compares to other Sony phones, since this is the first one I've owned; after so long on stock Android, it took some getting used to, but installing the Google Keyboard helped a lot (I rely on the swipe-from-backspace to delete words/phrases quite a lot, and I never want to go back). The dedicated two-stage shutter button is nice, and does a good job of starting the camera without any fuss; though it wasn't quite as quick as I expected, it's still under a second.What I failed to notice (and still can't find on this product page) is that this is the international version. Which means the fingerprint sensor works (really well), it is compatible with more radio bands, and oh yeah- starts in Chinese, which makes all the ""Getting started"" prompts a nightmare to get through. This seller also was nice enough to include a ""travel adapter,"" since without it, you wouldn't be able to charge this phone in the U.S. I'm always hesitant to buy products on Amazon from third-party vendors, and these guys (NGP STORE USA) are a good example of why. If literally any of this had been in the description, I may have still purchased the phone. I certainly wouldn't have been so frustrated when I powered on the phone, and could've bought a separate OEM charger ahead of time.At least they shipped quickly.Bottom line is: decent phone, great camera, as small as advertised (for better or worse), working fingerprint sensor, great if you speak Chinese, buy a separate charger, or purchase from Amazon directly."
"391279","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Black (US Warranty)",5,"Excellent small footprint smart phone, just what I was looking for. Camera seems powerful once it's mastered. Ability to preserve battery power when not used is better than any previous phone I've had. The remaining question is durability."
"391280","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Black (US Warranty)",4,"It's a nice phone just wish it was smaller in a little more thinner. the os is way smoother and faster than my z5 compact but overall I like it ."
"391281","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Black (US Warranty)",2,"The X compact feels slower, is not waterproof, is thicker, has an inconvenient USB-C port, has a camera which seems equal or poorer (especially in low light), and generally is not an upgrade in any sense of the word. Two positives: the black/blue color is beautiful, and the screen may be slightly superior. Not enough: upgrades need to be superior, Sony!"
"391282","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Black (US Warranty)",3,"Is this phone 4G LTE. I have it activated by ATT and not able to get the 4G signal after several calls to their customer service."
"391283","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Black (US Warranty)",5,"This is one of the few flagship phones that still comes in a compact form factor, but with the smaller size you're not actually giving up much at all. It's also cheaper than a lot of other flagships to boot. Battery life on this is amazing, probably close to 8-9 hours of screen on time. If it doesn't get used much all day, then it'll easily have over 80% charge left at night. Reminds me of old Nokia phones in that regard: excellent battery life and power management.The build quality is really solid. The screen is mildly curved on the edges (but not nearly as much as many other curved screens), giving it that little bit extra of a 'fancy' feel. The white color is also really unique. Doesn't come with a lot of bloatware at all, it's quick, snappy, multitasks well, and the camera is pretty fine too.Overall, probably the single best option if you're looking for a compact flagship-level phone in 2016 (and likely well into 2017), and actually gives many full-sized flagship phones a run too."
"391284","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Black (US Warranty)",5,"Sony gets a lot of flak for this phone using the 650 chipset but honestly I am glad they did. There are no heat issues and the phone is blazing fast. Being a compact the phone feels great in the hand and there is no more ""hand shimmy"" needed to get to everything on the screen. Not to mention that it doesn't take up all of your pocket real estate if you like keeping your phone in the front. Needless to say the battery life is also amazing. This will get you through all day usage and then some even if you watch a movie or two on netflix. If your looking for a solid one hander with great performance and long battery life this is it."
"391285","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Black (US Warranty)",3,"I have problems with the phone. Only work for one day and I called Sony to help me but they could not. So at this point I need to return the phone"
"391286","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Black (US Warranty)",5,"I have a small palm and short fingers, it fits perfectly. Feels very solid and looks very pleasing. Love the UI experience."
"391287","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Black (US Warranty)",4,"Since most others have already reviewed the major specs, I'll just touch on the two features that I was the most curious about but no one else seemed to review.Camera speed: So I'm a pet parent, and as every pet parent knows, shutter speed is extremely important when it comes to catching that oh-so-cute face your pup or kitty (I have both) are making at you before they ruin it with a yawn or getting distracted by a squirrel. My last phone (Galaxy SIII) was super quick at taking photos, even if they were blurred from the motion. I decided against the Xperia Z5 compact because of all the reviews on the slow camera speed. The X Compact appears to load the camera much quicker than what I saw in videos for the Z5 Compact, especially if you load by double clicking the power button. (it's a slower load via the dedicated camera button.) The shutter speed, however, is quicker than my husband's Xperia Z3 flagship, but still slower than my Galaxy S III. Even so, the auto focus does act pretty quickly, and it seems quicker the better the lighting is. The picture quality is pretty good, though, except that the colors are on the bluish side in dim lighting.Speakerphone quality: How is it 2016 and speakerphone quality is worse than before?! Maybe it's a Sony problem. Husband's Z3 is barely audible on speakerphone, and the X Compact made only slight improvement. It's audible when it's dead quiet around you, but less so when I'm walking the dog outside, and near impossible when I'm in the car. What's the big deal about these front facing speakers if I can't hear the other person very well?! (note: speakers seem to be great for playing videos and games.)Phone still gets 4 stars because of all the other nice features everyone else had already reviewed. But wanted to share about those two points since they are not often talked about."
"391288","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Black (US Warranty)",5,"Sexy, sexy phone! Camera needs some patience, but end results are wonderful!"
"391289","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Black (US Warranty)",4,"If you are looking for a mid sized phone you can use with one hand in October of 2016 this phone is your best option.Pros:- Phone fits in one hand- Battery life lasts all day and in some cases two days- Phone works great on T-mobile's network while also having band 12 for faster LTE (Works well on AT&T too)- UI is smooth and doesn't lag with a minimalist skin over stock android- No overheating issues like z5 compact- Android 7.0 N due to release in November- USB C with quick charge 3.0- Expandable memory- Front facing speakersCons- Plastic doesn't feel as premium like the s7 and iphone 7- Fairly thick for a phone made in 2016- Camera is adequate but has trouble in low light and tends to overexpose in daylight- No amoled display- Volume buttons are too low although they function well when using the camera- No fingerprint sensor with US version- No waterproofing- Black is more of a dark blueIt's unfortunate that the market is saturated with so many phablets and we have very little choice when it comes to conservatively sized devices but all in all I think this is a good phone that you won't regret buying if you are wanting a moderately sized phone"
"391290","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Black (US Warranty)",3,"I got it in ""Midnight Black"" They should have called it Navy Blue!? Why Sony? It bugs me, because it really is blue. I own both Xperia Z3 and Z5 and I think I'll send the XC back. It's very nice, comfortable to hold and the buttons are a little more out of the way. But the processor is faster on the Z5 and the rest of the specs aren't hugely different. If it was only truly black I'd probably keep it although there is a lot of plastic on it."
"391291","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Black (US Warranty)",3,"This phone is basically the same as Sony Xperia Z5 Compact. Only upside: 1GB more ram. Downsides: not waterproof, slower processor, USB-C instead of standard Micro-USB, more expensive.At this price point Z5 Compact international model (that has fingerprint scanner) feels like a much better purchase."
"391292","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Black (US Warranty)",5,"Starting off, I'm coming from a Nexus 5 (2013) and I primarily got this phone because the Nexus was getting a bit long in the tooth, so this is a big jump for me in terms of phones and I think it's great overall. I chose the X Compact (over, let's say, the new Moto phones or the Pixel phones about to come out) primarily due to its smaller size as well as its design (though the X Compact was definitely in the upper limit of what I was willing to pay for a new phone); I rather enjoy the simple, clean design of it with the curves along the long edges. Looking at just the specs, it does seem overpriced (I got this at a pretty nice deal, though), but I ultimately enjoy the purchase.My pros and cons are coming from a user that doesn't play games, nor watch too many videos or listen to music too much. I just use it for chatting with friends and communicating with co workers (e.g. text, e-mail, etc), and browsing everyone's favorite news aggregator. Sprinkle in some photo taking, reading the news, and that's pretty much all I use my smartphone for, so my expectations are set accordingly.Pros:+ Clean, simple design with a nice color+ Nice pocketable size+ 720p screen looks great+ Speedy performance for what I need/want+ Dual front facing speakers+ Camera seems nice (I haven't tested it too rigorously yet, however)+ Good battery life (easily lasts me a day with 40% left, but again, I'm not a heavy user)+ Fast charging, and USB C is nice (though I guess I have to get an adapter for all my micro USB chargers)+ Great, lightly skinned Android with 7.0 Nougat updates confirmed (albeit sometime in November, I think?)I can't think of too many cons since I'm not exactly the pickiest, and I'm still in the honeymoon stage with this phone.Cons:- Bit expensive for the hardware you get compared to other phones- Some bloatware that can't be uninstalled, but you can hide them from your apps drawer- Speakers aren't the loudest- Not too many accessories out yet (e.g. cases, screen protectors)Again, I really like this phone, but if you're looking for a phone with top of the line specs or something of comparable specs to this one at a lower price point, you may want to look elsewhere (e.g. OnePlus 3, Moto G4 family, Nexus 5X/6P, etc). I'll try to update this in a month or two, however, when I can probably be a bit more discerning. Hope this helps!"
"391293","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Black (US Warranty)",4,"I use this phone for few hours and found how fast the battery dies after my iPhone SE. But this is not the biggest problem (I assume I'll not use so hard phone in next days). There is no WiFi calling on T-Mobile and may be VoLTE on this phone. At least, I couldn't find it...Updated WiFi: thanks to comments and also talked to T-Mobile representative - WiFi calling is not SONY's problem. So, I'm adding one more star to Sony, take one from T-Mobile :)"
"391294","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Mist Blue (US Warranty)",5,"This phone is very sleek and beautiful, it's fast and does everything it supposed to without lagging. It's a good phone for the price. However, it's a big annoying that Sony doesn't send out headphones with the phone, but that's alright. It comes with the faster charging wall plug, and I've noticed that the phone does charge way faster when it's connected to the plug. The speakers on this phone aren't the best, they're ok though. Not very loud, but they are clear sounding. The cameras are not that good in low light, but everything else about the phone is an A+."
"391295","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Mist Blue (US Warranty)",5,"Love it.It's a great sizeUI is fastBattery life is excellent (usually use 30-50%/day)Screen is very good, don't let the releativly low resolution be a deterent, it's quite good even looking at very small detail.The built-in Sony apps can be somewhat annoying and not all can be uninstalled, but just hide them in a folder and turn off notification and they dont bother you.My only concerns are more with Andriod than anything Sony did. The privacy controls are insuffient, too much reliancy on google and it's qutie a hassle to disable cloud based data sharing. (On the positive side you don't need any relationship with Sony to use everything, a Sony account and cloud services can be skipped on startup and settings).As others have noted, this is the US SKU. That means it's missing 2 features: 1 no fingerprint reader, and 2 no smart battery control. Most people know about the first one, but the lack of smart battery control is hidden in the manual. This means no ""learning your habits"" and charging a less than a max speed. Because of this I don't plugin my phone overnight because I don't want it to charge to 100% or do so at a rapid speed, both of which lessen your battery life in the long term."
"391296","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Mist Blue (US Warranty)",5,"Love it"
"391297","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Mist Blue (US Warranty)",5,"I recently purchased the White US version of the X Compact for $350 after a great two years with this phone’s grandfather the Z3C. After debating whether to purchase the X Compact, Galaxy S7, Google Pixel and Honor 8, I’m quite happy with my decision. There have been some extremely critical reviews of the device - discrediting it as no longer being the compact flagship, but for the niche market that enjoys small-form factor android phones, the device is top of class. This review will highlight some of the unique features that I’ve encountered as well as addressing some of the harsh criticisms I’ve seen in other reviews.Design:I’ve always been a fan of Sony’s clean and minimalist design language for its Xperia line and this phone is no exception. In a market where every phone seems to have a utilitarian brushed metal or flashy, shiny design, the white model of this phone is a refreshing change. The looped edges (which are very akin to the Lumia Windows Phones) and small size of the device offer the perfect dimensions for one handed operation without performing a balancing act with your fingers. The 2.5D curved glass that seamlessly loops into to back of the unit which offers a unique feeling I’ve never experienced. The phone also does a great job of catching the light in interesting ways and it's been the first phone I’ve used that has literally turned heads when walking down the street.Build:Many people have been really harsh on this phone for having a plastic rear. While it is true that it can be easily scratched, I think Sony has gracefully addressed one of the biggest complaints of their previous lines while keeping true to their design aesthetic. Let me explain: the two predecessors to this phone, the Z3C and Z5C both had glass panels on the rear of the phone. While elegant and more scratch resistant than plastic, the phones were prone to spontaneous cracking, even while in a case. Sony could have gone the route of using a metal back, but at the cost of poor reception or having a plastic chin (like the Xperia XZ), but it would go against their clean slab design language they’ve retained for the previous lines. As someone who has always used his phone with a case or a skin, having the plastic back is not a problem for me.Another pain-point with this phone has been the lack of waterproofing that the Xperia line has become iconic for. After seeing videos online of people verifying the waterproofing and testing for myself, I can confirm that this phone is in fact waterproof. I can’t make any claims for the actual ingress rating, but I’ve been able to use my phone in the shower everyday since purchasing the phone without problems. My theory is the Sony omitted waterproofing as a an on-paper feature for this phone because it new that labor costs of repairing warranty claims for the device would not be cost effective for the volume sold to the US and UK markets, where larger devices reign supreme. If that isn’t evidence enough, the X Compact in Asian markets have the waterproof rating where smaller phones are more popular and where Sony has more resources to make warranty claims.The final pain-point I’ve seen with this phone is the fact that the US version does not have a fingerprint scanner. It does indeed have a fingerprint scanner, but because of a patent conflict with Hewlett-Packard, Sony had to disable it for the US markets. If you’re willing to get your hands dirty with android development, you can actually download and install the signed, UK firmware of the phone to enable the fingerprint scanner. As a plus, since the firmware is official and signed by Sony, you will not lose your warranty if you conduct the procedure. And what a fingerprint scanner it is. The scanner is extremely accurate, placed in the perfect position and unlocks my phone before I even I can even pull it out of my pocket.As for the rest of the phone, the device has the signature dual front facing speakers that are a huge improvement from the Z3C speakers. They won’t wow anyone with their loudness, but they’re perfect having crisp clean audio for sharing media with friends. The camera button is always welcomed and has a tactile dual click to allow focus lock before capture when taking pictures. The volume controls, on the other hand are in an awkward place. Sony has a tendency to place the volume buttons close to the camera shutter for use as a zoom keys, but I’ve noticed that I more often than not pinch the screen to zoom in so I would love to see those keys moved to the upper-left side of the device.Display:This is hands down one of the most gorgeous displays I have ever used. I’ve held this phone up to a Google Pixel (which has an AMOLED screen) and this device can go toe-to-toe with the Pixel’s Brightness and Saturation despite having a LCD panel screen. It's absolutely incredible how beautiful the display is. The colors are juicy and watching movies on the device is. That being said,unfortunately because it is an LCD panel it cannot achieve the absolute blackness that an AMOLED screen can. For me, it’s not noticeable enough to bother me but I can see how that could be an issue for people coming from AMOLED devices.Many people have been hyper-critical of the fact that this phone uses a 720p display in 2016. A 720p display is perfect for a display this size. iPhones have had similar resolutions for years without any complaint. Here is a comparison with the current gen iPhone handsets:iPhone SE: 4.0inch Screen at 1136 x 640 (320 pixels per inch)X Compact: 4.6inch Screen at 1280 x 720 (319 pixels per inch)iPhone 7: 4.7inch Screen at 1334 x 750 (326 pixels per inch)Yes, you can get Android phones with 400+ pixels per inch, but why have a screen that is more demanding on performance and battery life if you can’t even discern the individuals with the naked eye? Sony has realized this and chose the optimum screen for the form factor.Performance:Many people have criticized the fact that this device uses a Snapdragon 650 Processor instead of an 820 like its big brother. I think Sony chose this processor for a couple reasons. The smaller resolution of the X Compact means that similar rendering performance can be achieved with a scaled back processor. The 650 is also more power efficient than its big brother, which allows it to achieve the ludicrous battery life that the Compact line is known for. Yes this phone might not have the same raw performance numbers as some of the other top of the line phones on the market, but I have yet to experience any hiccups in any applications I’ve tried. And at the end of the day, isn’t that what really matters?Photo-Quality:This is still one of the primary reasons why I buy Sony phones. Sony devices have one of the most powerful imaging devices for android - if you know how to dial in the settings. The 23 MP Camera allows for fidelity I’ve never been able to achieve in any phone I’ve tried. The camera app has all of the controls you’d expect from a DSLR, but in a compact size. One of the biggest improvements from the previous camera app is the ability to control shutter speed now. Also, compared to the Z3C, the automatic mode is much better at finding the right settings for the current scene. Handheld and low-light pictures are also much clearer thanks to the new laser auto-focus and improved capture speed. I can speak for the camera all day long, but I’ll just attach some pictures so you can see for yourself.Battery Life:This is the most battery efficient smart phone I’ve ever used. My usage habits typically involve using GPS and streaming music on my way to work, checking social media, news and dating apps throughout the day, photo taking in the afternoon and casting media in the evening. I would consider myself someone with heavy use with the exception of playing 3D games. I’ve been able to go from 8am to 10pm with over 40% battery left without any active battery saving features.I’ve always been a huge fan of Sony’s built in battery saving features. I’ve tested the device with Stamina Enabled for the full duration of the battery and a more normal usage pattern, and it is a breeze to get up to 3 full days of use. If you want to stretch it even further, you can turn on Ultra Stamina Mode which turns off all your apps sans the basic. With that mode enabled, my phone has predicted that it can go up to 2 weeks.Software:Sony’s build of android is almost entirely stock save a couple of power saving features and some bloatware. Sony’s own included apps have varying degrees of use. Sony makes one of the best Album apps I’ve used but things like LifeLog, Xperia Lounge and What’s New I could do without. As for the third party software, Sony actually includes some useful ones including Amazon Shopping and Swiftkey. Luckily if there is anything you don’t like, you can easily disable any apps you don’t like.Accessories:One of the biggest downfalls for the device is the accessory support. Two things I usually buy when I get a new phone are a tempered glass screen protector and a Ringke Fusion Case. Because of the negative reception to the phone and low volume, many of the common accessory manufacturers have elected to pass up this device in their production line up. In my attempts to find a screen protector, I’ve been unable to find any that have a complete adhesive hold to the entire screen; the screen protectors either omit the curved edges or screen protectors that only attach from adhesive on the edges, leaving a noticeable air gap between the screen and protector. Thus, I’ve had to resort to using Skinomi’s screen protector in the interim. Unfortunately Ringke does not have any plans to make their Fusion case for this device, but I was able to find the MicroP TPU case which achieves some similar design aesthetics as the Ringke cases.TLDR:Pros:- Beautiful design- Small form factor phone- Beautiful display- Fast fingerprint sensor- Unofficial but present waterproofing- Insane battery life- Great cameraCons:- Very little accessory support (Cases / screen protectors)- Activating fingerprint sensor requires some tinkering- Volume buttons in an awkward location for use with volumeVerdict:The Xperia X Compact is one of the best options if you’re looking for a small form factor phone with an excellent camera and battery life. This phone does have its fair share of nuances that make it less approachable than offerings by Samsung, Xiaomi and Google, but with a little work you can turn the device into an absolute pleasure to use."

It has many new, up to date features with the same reliability as any other android. Shipping was fast and efficient, and the box comes with everything you need to get started. This is a great phone from a great company, and I would recommend it to anyone!"
"391299","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Mist Blue (US Warranty)",4,"This phone is great and simple to work. I bought it to replace my Japanese phone that the company wouldn't allow me to upgrade. The only issue with this cell phone is it is not Japan certified so mobile data does not work with it."
"391300","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Mist Blue (US Warranty)",5,"The Sony compact series has always been my go to for an Android phone because of the size and speed. The previous compacts were based on the latest and greatest highest end chip set at the time of their releases. When this phone was announced as having the SD 650, I was more than disappointed so I wrote the phone off. I wasn't sure which phone to get so I bought an iPhone 7 which lasted a couple weeks until I remembered how restricted ios was. I then had three options for a smallish phone. The Honor 8.. Still a little large, the Google pixel.. Expensive! and the Sony X compact. I had all three within about a month. I kept the X compact. Yep that's right. I gave up the greatest from Google and a very premium made Honor 8. The reason?Number 1-the feel and size are just right. Its just a joy to use and carry.Number 2- i immediately realized that this phone is just as fast as the z5 compact and I'm not sure what they did but this phone is silky smooth, almost iphone like. You have some hang ups like every other Android like in the play Store but overall I am really impressed with the performance. That just shows that specs are not everything and there is something to be said for real optimization.Number - 3 price. It was dropped to $399 when I bought mine. Compared to the pixel, it's half the price.I'm no Camara guru so I can't really speak on this too much but it does take some real nice shots in good light. Low light will not be the best.Many people are bashing because the phone isn't waterproof but it doesn't bother me.*edit. It's frustrating when someone gives one star and is not even talking about this phone!! The X compact does NOT have a cover for the USB!!!! This proves that the reviewer is ignorant. Amazon needs to monitor these reviews better!!"
"391301","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Mist Blue (US Warranty)",4,"This is by no means a perfect phone but this is really the best you can get for a small android phone. Almost all the phone manufacturers have dismissed making a small phone in favor of their 5+ inch slabs. I started using androids with a Moto X 2013, which to me was the perfect 4.7 inch phone if you disregard the crappy camera that it had. Unfortunately, Motorola decided bigger is better with their later models, and now the their Chinese overlords that currently own them have pretty much stated that they have no plans of making a small phone again. In fact, they have gone full retard with them making their current phones even bigger and wider.After the Moto X started slowing down after a few drops and age, I ""upgraded"" to the new Moto G 2015, which was not too bad in terms of screen height at 5 inches, but the width of this tubby made it hard to handle with one hand. Not to mention that is was a downgrade from the beautiful AMOLED screen from the Moto X. My camera and LED light crapped out after I dropped my Moto G so I got the Xperia X Compact after some research.Now the nice things about this phone:- Screen: I'm not much of a high res snob but 720p works for this size and it looks much better than my Moto G which had that resolution for 5 inches. Just wish this was an AMOLED for those nice dark blacks.- Memory: I've felt no slowdowns as far as RAM when multitasking. For regular storage you have 32GB which is enough for most people but you can also expand it 256 GB more with a micro SD.- Camera: Best camera that I've had which is not saying much given what my previous phones are. Other people would probably be more credible than me since I never but too much importance on this function but these pictures do look sweet.- Speed: Feels a hell of a lot snappier than my previous phone which is really no surprise with the superior processor. Apparently, the lower resolution gives it a faster speed than say a 1080p would.- Button placement: Yes, I actually like where the sound buttons are placed. I use my phones left handed (even though I'm right handed) and the button placement for volume is actually not awkward as it would be for a right handed user. This doubles as a convenient zoom in and out button for the camera.- Double front facing speakers: A rarity these days, especially for this phone size. Very high quality audio too.-Battery life: About 40-60% at the end of a day which is pretty good for me but this will depend on the person and what apps they are using.Not so great things:- Exterior design: Could have used a more matte, less slippery design. Shows fingerprints. All this can be fixed with a skin but this should not have been necessary. Ergonomics are inferior to the curved Motorola and Samsung designs for handling, while this did improve from the previous blocky Sony phones by curving the sides, they could have done better.Price: This isn't too bad now that Sony has put down the crack pipe and lowered the price from their initial 500 dollar tag.Neutral things:- Lack of fingerprint scanner: This can actually be enabled by reflashing to the UK version which is what I did. Does appear to show less bars on reception as mentioned by a previous reviewer but the connection seems to work just fine. Would not recommend doing this for everyone but do it at your own risk or just buy the international version.-No waterproofing: More accurately, this is not warrantied as being waterproof. YouTube videos have shown that this is actually pretty water resistant and that Sony most likely just doesn't want to cover claims.Say what you will about Sony, while they are deserving of much criticism for their reported crappy customer service and overpricing of their phones, they are the only ones in the android market that are meeting a neglected segment by making a decent phone that is easy to handle one handed, that has a near stock android feel, and actually has the back and recent keys on the correct sides (looking at you Samsung).Note: Still in early ownership and will update if there are any snags."
"391302","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Mist Blue (US Warranty)",5,"I wanted a smaller phone than my last one (One Plus). This one is the perfect size for me. Small enough to fit in my pocket, but not so small you can't do anything on it. I really like the light blue color. So far, I have no complaints (I've had it for about a month). It takes great pictures too! I am very happy with my purchase."
"391303","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Mist Blue (US Warranty)",5,"I realy so happy. It is so fast and nice phone. I used iphone 7 plus but it so big .the best compact phone . I love X compact."
"391304","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Mist Blue (US Warranty)",3,"Good phone. Terrible customer service from Amazon."
"391305","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Mist Blue (US Warranty)",4,"I've only had it a few days, so if I can remember I'll return to update this review some weeks from now. Thus far, I'm loving this little thing.On the outside, this thing is a really sleek device. I dislike the fingerprint magnet nature of the surface but it's not that big a deal to me. Aside from that, it feels substantive and of good quality despite being made of plastic. The screen is fantastic; the size and resolution, the colors, the brightness. I love it having USB type C, even if it is still at USB 2.0 speeds. While also on the thicker size (9.5 mm if I recall correctly), it still feels diminutive and nice in the hand. The camera... I'm mixed about. I tried taking some seemingly easy auto photos and got somewhat bad results, whereas my Lumia 950 and Honor 8 produced some consistently great shots. Like the Lumia 950, I LOVE that this has a shutter button.On the inside, the Snapdragon 650 positively *sings* on this paired with 3 GB RAM. Everything is so quick, speedy, and nicely animated. Software seems to be just about stock Android 6.0 and it shows. Battery life so far has been great, but that largely depends on the radios and whatever signal strength you're getting on a given day (seems better than the 950 or Honor 8, truthfully).Of significant note since this is the US model: THE FINGERPRINT SENSOR IS STILL THERE, BUT DISABLED THROUGH SOFTWARE. I was able to get the UK version of the software onto this one and it actually works. Search for it; there should be a thread on XDA forums that explains it. There is a perceived drop in cell reception (going from 5 bars and LTE indicator in the US to 4 bars and simple 4G indicator in the UK). It's odd, just earlier I was browsing the internet with great speed on only 1 bar of 4G; this leads me to believe that 1.) 4G here can indicate LTE but just doesn't show it, and 2.) one bar of '4G' isn't actually all that bad. Again, this is with the UK software. Great experience so far! (:"
"391306","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Mist Blue (US Warranty)",4,"I purchased this phone about two weeks ago. This is my first android phone after switching from an iPhone 6. I've been pleasantly surprised by the phone so far. The andorid version on it seems decent and it works pretty well. The battery life is similar to my iPhone 6, with slightly better life when making phone calls and worse when doing a lot of data heavy tasks in facebook, twitter, google plus, email programs and browsing. It makes it easily through a day for me.Most of my issues so far have not been with the phone itself, but rather other services I want to use.For example, I haven't had any luck getting the AT&T visual voicemail app working with this phone. This was one of the few killer iOS features i miss and I feel like it should be built into android rather than apps for each phone company that suck and have a whitelist. This isn't sony's fault aside from their lack of a deal with any major carier in the US.The second issue is a lack of decent cases for the phone. Most of the ones on amazon so far have been cheap, soft cases that don't really hold up well. The screen protectors work as I had a drop the other day and it did take a chunk out of the protector but the phone is fine. I think I'm spoiled from owning an iphone for so many years, but a decent leather case would be much appreciated. Sony should offer some kind of case for it at least or make a deal for them.Finally, the text messaging app that is default with the phone isn't very good. This is easy to fix on android, but then I wasn't sure what to use. Many apps support it and I didn't see a feature matrix to know what to use. In this case, I think sony should consider a better default messaging app.The camera on the phone is decent, but I had hoped for a bit more. It's not as good in darker rooms as my iPhone was. It's also very bad when there is a lot of motion. For the price difference, this isn't a deal breaker for me but if you're really into photos this might not be the phone for you.A lot of people have asked me about the phone and commented on the appearance. Many people are impressed by the screen quality. I was as well. It's quite vivid.I do wish sony would fix their policy about not offering fingerprint scanning in the US. I miss that from my iphone.Another small headache was that contact imports were a problem. AT&T offered a tool to migrate and it was great for photos but only could grab 75 contacts. I had around 300. I ended up doing an export from icloud and then importing using google's contacts website. Most instructions online assume that you have a GMAIL account associated with google. In my case, I have a non google email account and it required finding this contacts site to actually work. The google site also cleaned up some duplicates from the AT&T import which was nice. Sony also has an app which I didn't try for contacts. It may have worked better. I'd recommend people just go right for the google site approach, especially if they don't need pictures imported.The location services are a bit buggy. I have it set to unlock my phone if it is at my house and it doesn't work sometimes. I don't know if that is an android issue or the phone GPS. The iphone was smart enough to realize if i was near my wifi i was home. I wish this phone understood that.Lastly, I had some issues with email. The stock app can connect to regular IMAP accounts fine. It works good for that. I also had a work GMAIL account with a custom domain and an exchange email account for grad school email. I didn't even try to use gmail from that app so I can't comment on that. I setup google gmail app. However, on my old iphone i had all but work mail setup in apple mail. With this phone, if i try to use exchange it tries to lock down the phone and won't allow any other email accounts to be setup. If I use microsoft outlook app, it works fine. I think this is a combination of a domain setup fail and the app. It shouldn't require those strict limitations on the email app if outlook works! This means I have 3 different mail programs to check 4 accounts. Kind of annoying."
"391307","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Mist Blue (US Warranty)",5,"Great product,"
"391308","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Mist Blue (US Warranty)",3,"The phone itself is fine; the camera does well with moving subjects and low light situations. The bloatware is worse than Nexus or Motorola/Moto devices, but closer to stock Android than any other carrier's. The sound is great, and though the screen was a little hard to get used to after using a larger phone, being able to comfortably use a phone with one hand again really is pretty nice. I can't speak to how it compares to other Sony phones, since this is the first one I've owned; after so long on stock Android, it took some getting used to, but installing the Google Keyboard helped a lot (I rely on the swipe-from-backspace to delete words/phrases quite a lot, and I never want to go back). The dedicated two-stage shutter button is nice, and does a good job of starting the camera without any fuss; though it wasn't quite as quick as I expected, it's still under a second.What I failed to notice (and still can't find on this product page) is that this is the international version. Which means the fingerprint sensor works (really well), it is compatible with more radio bands, and oh yeah- starts in Chinese, which makes all the ""Getting started"" prompts a nightmare to get through. This seller also was nice enough to include a ""travel adapter,"" since without it, you wouldn't be able to charge this phone in the U.S. I'm always hesitant to buy products on Amazon from third-party vendors, and these guys (NGP STORE USA) are a good example of why. If literally any of this had been in the description, I may have still purchased the phone. I certainly wouldn't have been so frustrated when I powered on the phone, and could've bought a separate OEM charger ahead of time.At least they shipped quickly.Bottom line is: decent phone, great camera, as small as advertised (for better or worse), working fingerprint sensor, great if you speak Chinese, buy a separate charger, or purchase from Amazon directly."
"391309","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Mist Blue (US Warranty)",5,"Excellent small footprint smart phone, just what I was looking for. Camera seems powerful once it's mastered. Ability to preserve battery power when not used is better than any previous phone I've had. The remaining question is durability."
"391310","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Mist Blue (US Warranty)",4,"It's a nice phone just wish it was smaller in a little more thinner. the os is way smoother and faster than my z5 compact but overall I like it ."
"391311","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Mist Blue (US Warranty)",2,"The X compact feels slower, is not waterproof, is thicker, has an inconvenient USB-C port, has a camera which seems equal or poorer (especially in low light), and generally is not an upgrade in any sense of the word. Two positives: the black/blue color is beautiful, and the screen may be slightly superior. Not enough: upgrades need to be superior, Sony!"
"391312","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Mist Blue (US Warranty)",3,"Is this phone 4G LTE. I have it activated by ATT and not able to get the 4G signal after several calls to their customer service."
"391313","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Mist Blue (US Warranty)",5,"This is one of the few flagship phones that still comes in a compact form factor, but with the smaller size you're not actually giving up much at all. It's also cheaper than a lot of other flagships to boot. Battery life on this is amazing, probably close to 8-9 hours of screen on time. If it doesn't get used much all day, then it'll easily have over 80% charge left at night. Reminds me of old Nokia phones in that regard: excellent battery life and power management.The build quality is really solid. The screen is mildly curved on the edges (but not nearly as much as many other curved screens), giving it that little bit extra of a 'fancy' feel. The white color is also really unique. Doesn't come with a lot of bloatware at all, it's quick, snappy, multitasks well, and the camera is pretty fine too.Overall, probably the single best option if you're looking for a compact flagship-level phone in 2016 (and likely well into 2017), and actually gives many full-sized flagship phones a run too."
"391314","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Mist Blue (US Warranty)",5,"Sony gets a lot of flak for this phone using the 650 chipset but honestly I am glad they did. There are no heat issues and the phone is blazing fast. Being a compact the phone feels great in the hand and there is no more ""hand shimmy"" needed to get to everything on the screen. Not to mention that it doesn't take up all of your pocket real estate if you like keeping your phone in the front. Needless to say the battery life is also amazing. This will get you through all day usage and then some even if you watch a movie or two on netflix. If your looking for a solid one hander with great performance and long battery life this is it."
"391315","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Mist Blue (US Warranty)",3,"I have problems with the phone. Only work for one day and I called Sony to help me but they could not. So at this point I need to return the phone"
"391316","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Mist Blue (US Warranty)",5,"I have a small palm and short fingers, it fits perfectly. Feels very solid and looks very pleasing. Love the UI experience."
"391317","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Mist Blue (US Warranty)",4,"Since most others have already reviewed the major specs, I'll just touch on the two features that I was the most curious about but no one else seemed to review.Camera speed: So I'm a pet parent, and as every pet parent knows, shutter speed is extremely important when it comes to catching that oh-so-cute face your pup or kitty (I have both) are making at you before they ruin it with a yawn or getting distracted by a squirrel. My last phone (Galaxy SIII) was super quick at taking photos, even if they were blurred from the motion. I decided against the Xperia Z5 compact because of all the reviews on the slow camera speed. The X Compact appears to load the camera much quicker than what I saw in videos for the Z5 Compact, especially if you load by double clicking the power button. (it's a slower load via the dedicated camera button.) The shutter speed, however, is quicker than my husband's Xperia Z3 flagship, but still slower than my Galaxy S III. Even so, the auto focus does act pretty quickly, and it seems quicker the better the lighting is. The picture quality is pretty good, though, except that the colors are on the bluish side in dim lighting.Speakerphone quality: How is it 2016 and speakerphone quality is worse than before?! Maybe it's a Sony problem. Husband's Z3 is barely audible on speakerphone, and the X Compact made only slight improvement. It's audible when it's dead quiet around you, but less so when I'm walking the dog outside, and near impossible when I'm in the car. What's the big deal about these front facing speakers if I can't hear the other person very well?! (note: speakers seem to be great for playing videos and games.)Phone still gets 4 stars because of all the other nice features everyone else had already reviewed. But wanted to share about those two points since they are not often talked about."
"391318","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Mist Blue (US Warranty)",5,"Sexy, sexy phone! Camera needs some patience, but end results are wonderful!"
"391319","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Mist Blue (US Warranty)",4,"If you are looking for a mid sized phone you can use with one hand in October of 2016 this phone is your best option.Pros:- Phone fits in one hand- Battery life lasts all day and in some cases two days- Phone works great on T-mobile's network while also having band 12 for faster LTE (Works well on AT&T too)- UI is smooth and doesn't lag with a minimalist skin over stock android- No overheating issues like z5 compact- Android 7.0 N due to release in November- USB C with quick charge 3.0- Expandable memory- Front facing speakersCons- Plastic doesn't feel as premium like the s7 and iphone 7- Fairly thick for a phone made in 2016- Camera is adequate but has trouble in low light and tends to overexpose in daylight- No amoled display- Volume buttons are too low although they function well when using the camera- No fingerprint sensor with US version- No waterproofing- Black is more of a dark blueIt's unfortunate that the market is saturated with so many phablets and we have very little choice when it comes to conservatively sized devices but all in all I think this is a good phone that you won't regret buying if you are wanting a moderately sized phone"
"391320","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Mist Blue (US Warranty)",3,"I got it in ""Midnight Black"" They should have called it Navy Blue!? Why Sony? It bugs me, because it really is blue. I own both Xperia Z3 and Z5 and I think I'll send the XC back. It's very nice, comfortable to hold and the buttons are a little more out of the way. But the processor is faster on the Z5 and the rest of the specs aren't hugely different. If it was only truly black I'd probably keep it although there is a lot of plastic on it."
"391321","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Mist Blue (US Warranty)",3,"This phone is basically the same as Sony Xperia Z5 Compact. Only upside: 1GB more ram. Downsides: not waterproof, slower processor, USB-C instead of standard Micro-USB, more expensive.At this price point Z5 Compact international model (that has fingerprint scanner) feels like a much better purchase."
"391322","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Mist Blue (US Warranty)",5,"Starting off, I'm coming from a Nexus 5 (2013) and I primarily got this phone because the Nexus was getting a bit long in the tooth, so this is a big jump for me in terms of phones and I think it's great overall. I chose the X Compact (over, let's say, the new Moto phones or the Pixel phones about to come out) primarily due to its smaller size as well as its design (though the X Compact was definitely in the upper limit of what I was willing to pay for a new phone); I rather enjoy the simple, clean design of it with the curves along the long edges. Looking at just the specs, it does seem overpriced (I got this at a pretty nice deal, though), but I ultimately enjoy the purchase.My pros and cons are coming from a user that doesn't play games, nor watch too many videos or listen to music too much. I just use it for chatting with friends and communicating with co workers (e.g. text, e-mail, etc), and browsing everyone's favorite news aggregator. Sprinkle in some photo taking, reading the news, and that's pretty much all I use my smartphone for, so my expectations are set accordingly.Pros:+ Clean, simple design with a nice color+ Nice pocketable size+ 720p screen looks great+ Speedy performance for what I need/want+ Dual front facing speakers+ Camera seems nice (I haven't tested it too rigorously yet, however)+ Good battery life (easily lasts me a day with 40% left, but again, I'm not a heavy user)+ Fast charging, and USB C is nice (though I guess I have to get an adapter for all my micro USB chargers)+ Great, lightly skinned Android with 7.0 Nougat updates confirmed (albeit sometime in November, I think?)I can't think of too many cons since I'm not exactly the pickiest, and I'm still in the honeymoon stage with this phone.Cons:- Bit expensive for the hardware you get compared to other phones- Some bloatware that can't be uninstalled, but you can hide them from your apps drawer- Speakers aren't the loudest- Not too many accessories out yet (e.g. cases, screen protectors)Again, I really like this phone, but if you're looking for a phone with top of the line specs or something of comparable specs to this one at a lower price point, you may want to look elsewhere (e.g. OnePlus 3, Moto G4 family, Nexus 5X/6P, etc). I'll try to update this in a month or two, however, when I can probably be a bit more discerning. Hope this helps!"
"391323","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Mist Blue (US Warranty)",4,"I use this phone for few hours and found how fast the battery dies after my iPhone SE. But this is not the biggest problem (I assume I'll not use so hard phone in next days). There is no WiFi calling on T-Mobile and may be VoLTE on this phone. At least, I couldn't find it...Updated WiFi: thanks to comments and also talked to T-Mobile representative - WiFi calling is not SONY's problem. So, I'm adding one more star to Sony, take one from T-Mobile :)"
"391324","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Mist Blue (US Warranty)",5,"This phone is very sleek and beautiful, it's fast and does everything it supposed to without lagging. It's a good phone for the price. However, it's a big annoying that Sony doesn't send out headphones with the phone, but that's alright. It comes with the faster charging wall plug, and I've noticed that the phone does charge way faster when it's connected to the plug. The speakers on this phone aren't the best, they're ok though. Not very loud, but they are clear sounding. The cameras are not that good in low light, but everything else about the phone is an A+."
"391325","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Mist Blue (US Warranty)",5,"Love it.It's a great sizeUI is fastBattery life is excellent (usually use 30-50%/day)Screen is very good, don't let the releativly low resolution be a deterent, it's quite good even looking at very small detail.The built-in Sony apps can be somewhat annoying and not all can be uninstalled, but just hide them in a folder and turn off notification and they dont bother you.My only concerns are more with Andriod than anything Sony did. The privacy controls are insuffient, too much reliancy on google and it's qutie a hassle to disable cloud based data sharing. (On the positive side you don't need any relationship with Sony to use everything, a Sony account and cloud services can be skipped on startup and settings).As others have noted, this is the US SKU. That means it's missing 2 features: 1 no fingerprint reader, and 2 no smart battery control. Most people know about the first one, but the lack of smart battery control is hidden in the manual. This means no ""learning your habits"" and charging a less than a max speed. Because of this I don't plugin my phone overnight because I don't want it to charge to 100% or do so at a rapid speed, both of which lessen your battery life in the long term."
"391326","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Mist Blue (US Warranty)",5,"Love it"
"391327","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Mist Blue (US Warranty)",5,"I recently purchased the White US version of the X Compact for $350 after a great two years with this phone’s grandfather the Z3C. After debating whether to purchase the X Compact, Galaxy S7, Google Pixel and Honor 8, I’m quite happy with my decision. There have been some extremely critical reviews of the device - discrediting it as no longer being the compact flagship, but for the niche market that enjoys small-form factor android phones, the device is top of class. This review will highlight some of the unique features that I’ve encountered as well as addressing some of the harsh criticisms I’ve seen in other reviews.Design:I’ve always been a fan of Sony’s clean and minimalist design language for its Xperia line and this phone is no exception. In a market where every phone seems to have a utilitarian brushed metal or flashy, shiny design, the white model of this phone is a refreshing change. The looped edges (which are very akin to the Lumia Windows Phones) and small size of the device offer the perfect dimensions for one handed operation without performing a balancing act with your fingers. The 2.5D curved glass that seamlessly loops into to back of the unit which offers a unique feeling I’ve never experienced. The phone also does a great job of catching the light in interesting ways and it's been the first phone I’ve used that has literally turned heads when walking down the street.Build:Many people have been really harsh on this phone for having a plastic rear. While it is true that it can be easily scratched, I think Sony has gracefully addressed one of the biggest complaints of their previous lines while keeping true to their design aesthetic. Let me explain: the two predecessors to this phone, the Z3C and Z5C both had glass panels on the rear of the phone. While elegant and more scratch resistant than plastic, the phones were prone to spontaneous cracking, even while in a case. Sony could have gone the route of using a metal back, but at the cost of poor reception or having a plastic chin (like the Xperia XZ), but it would go against their clean slab design language they’ve retained for the previous lines. As someone who has always used his phone with a case or a skin, having the plastic back is not a problem for me.Another pain-point with this phone has been the lack of waterproofing that the Xperia line has become iconic for. After seeing videos online of people verifying the waterproofing and testing for myself, I can confirm that this phone is in fact waterproof. I can’t make any claims for the actual ingress rating, but I’ve been able to use my phone in the shower everyday since purchasing the phone without problems. My theory is the Sony omitted waterproofing as a an on-paper feature for this phone because it new that labor costs of repairing warranty claims for the device would not be cost effective for the volume sold to the US and UK markets, where larger devices reign supreme. If that isn’t evidence enough, the X Compact in Asian markets have the waterproof rating where smaller phones are more popular and where Sony has more resources to make warranty claims.The final pain-point I’ve seen with this phone is the fact that the US version does not have a fingerprint scanner. It does indeed have a fingerprint scanner, but because of a patent conflict with Hewlett-Packard, Sony had to disable it for the US markets. If you’re willing to get your hands dirty with android development, you can actually download and install the signed, UK firmware of the phone to enable the fingerprint scanner. As a plus, since the firmware is official and signed by Sony, you will not lose your warranty if you conduct the procedure. And what a fingerprint scanner it is. The scanner is extremely accurate, placed in the perfect position and unlocks my phone before I even I can even pull it out of my pocket.As for the rest of the phone, the device has the signature dual front facing speakers that are a huge improvement from the Z3C speakers. They won’t wow anyone with their loudness, but they’re perfect having crisp clean audio for sharing media with friends. The camera button is always welcomed and has a tactile dual click to allow focus lock before capture when taking pictures. The volume controls, on the other hand are in an awkward place. Sony has a tendency to place the volume buttons close to the camera shutter for use as a zoom keys, but I’ve noticed that I more often than not pinch the screen to zoom in so I would love to see those keys moved to the upper-left side of the device.Display:This is hands down one of the most gorgeous displays I have ever used. I’ve held this phone up to a Google Pixel (which has an AMOLED screen) and this device can go toe-to-toe with the Pixel’s Brightness and Saturation despite having a LCD panel screen. It's absolutely incredible how beautiful the display is. The colors are juicy and watching movies on the device is. That being said,unfortunately because it is an LCD panel it cannot achieve the absolute blackness that an AMOLED screen can. For me, it’s not noticeable enough to bother me but I can see how that could be an issue for people coming from AMOLED devices.Many people have been hyper-critical of the fact that this phone uses a 720p display in 2016. A 720p display is perfect for a display this size. iPhones have had similar resolutions for years without any complaint. Here is a comparison with the current gen iPhone handsets:iPhone SE: 4.0inch Screen at 1136 x 640 (320 pixels per inch)X Compact: 4.6inch Screen at 1280 x 720 (319 pixels per inch)iPhone 7: 4.7inch Screen at 1334 x 750 (326 pixels per inch)Yes, you can get Android phones with 400+ pixels per inch, but why have a screen that is more demanding on performance and battery life if you can’t even discern the individuals with the naked eye? Sony has realized this and chose the optimum screen for the form factor.Performance:Many people have criticized the fact that this device uses a Snapdragon 650 Processor instead of an 820 like its big brother. I think Sony chose this processor for a couple reasons. The smaller resolution of the X Compact means that similar rendering performance can be achieved with a scaled back processor. The 650 is also more power efficient than its big brother, which allows it to achieve the ludicrous battery life that the Compact line is known for. Yes this phone might not have the same raw performance numbers as some of the other top of the line phones on the market, but I have yet to experience any hiccups in any applications I’ve tried. And at the end of the day, isn’t that what really matters?Photo-Quality:This is still one of the primary reasons why I buy Sony phones. Sony devices have one of the most powerful imaging devices for android - if you know how to dial in the settings. The 23 MP Camera allows for fidelity I’ve never been able to achieve in any phone I’ve tried. The camera app has all of the controls you’d expect from a DSLR, but in a compact size. One of the biggest improvements from the previous camera app is the ability to control shutter speed now. Also, compared to the Z3C, the automatic mode is much better at finding the right settings for the current scene. Handheld and low-light pictures are also much clearer thanks to the new laser auto-focus and improved capture speed. I can speak for the camera all day long, but I’ll just attach some pictures so you can see for yourself.Battery Life:This is the most battery efficient smart phone I’ve ever used. My usage habits typically involve using GPS and streaming music on my way to work, checking social media, news and dating apps throughout the day, photo taking in the afternoon and casting media in the evening. I would consider myself someone with heavy use with the exception of playing 3D games. I’ve been able to go from 8am to 10pm with over 40% battery left without any active battery saving features.I’ve always been a huge fan of Sony’s built in battery saving features. I’ve tested the device with Stamina Enabled for the full duration of the battery and a more normal usage pattern, and it is a breeze to get up to 3 full days of use. If you want to stretch it even further, you can turn on Ultra Stamina Mode which turns off all your apps sans the basic. With that mode enabled, my phone has predicted that it can go up to 2 weeks.Software:Sony’s build of android is almost entirely stock save a couple of power saving features and some bloatware. Sony’s own included apps have varying degrees of use. Sony makes one of the best Album apps I’ve used but things like LifeLog, Xperia Lounge and What’s New I could do without. As for the third party software, Sony actually includes some useful ones including Amazon Shopping and Swiftkey. Luckily if there is anything you don’t like, you can easily disable any apps you don’t like.Accessories:One of the biggest downfalls for the device is the accessory support. Two things I usually buy when I get a new phone are a tempered glass screen protector and a Ringke Fusion Case. Because of the negative reception to the phone and low volume, many of the common accessory manufacturers have elected to pass up this device in their production line up. In my attempts to find a screen protector, I’ve been unable to find any that have a complete adhesive hold to the entire screen; the screen protectors either omit the curved edges or screen protectors that only attach from adhesive on the edges, leaving a noticeable air gap between the screen and protector. Thus, I’ve had to resort to using Skinomi’s screen protector in the interim. Unfortunately Ringke does not have any plans to make their Fusion case for this device, but I was able to find the MicroP TPU case which achieves some similar design aesthetics as the Ringke cases.TLDR:Pros:- Beautiful design- Small form factor phone- Beautiful display- Fast fingerprint sensor- Unofficial but present waterproofing- Insane battery life- Great cameraCons:- Very little accessory support (Cases / screen protectors)- Activating fingerprint sensor requires some tinkering- Volume buttons in an awkward location for use with volumeVerdict:The Xperia X Compact is one of the best options if you’re looking for a small form factor phone with an excellent camera and battery life. This phone does have its fair share of nuances that make it less approachable than offerings by Samsung, Xiaomi and Google, but with a little work you can turn the device into an absolute pleasure to use."
"391328","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Mist Blue (US Warranty)",5,"I chose this phone because of it's smaller, more portable size, and it has worked perfectly so far. It has many new, up to date features with the same reliability as any other android. Shipping was fast and efficient, and the box comes with everything you need to get started. This is a great phone from a great company, and I would recommend it to anyone!"
"391329","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Mist Blue (US Warranty)",4,"This phone is great and simple to work. I bought it to replace my Japanese phone that the company wouldn't allow me to upgrade. The only issue with this cell phone is it is not Japan certified so mobile data does not work with it."
"391330","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Mist Blue (US Warranty)",5,"The Sony compact series has always been my go to for an Android phone because of the size and speed. The previous compacts were based on the latest and greatest highest end chip set at the time of their releases. When this phone was announced as having the SD 650, I was more than disappointed so I wrote the phone off. I wasn't sure which phone to get so I bought an iPhone 7 which lasted a couple weeks until I remembered how restricted ios was. I then had three options for a smallish phone. The Honor 8.. Still a little large, the Google pixel.. Expensive! and the Sony X compact. I had all three within about a month. I kept the X compact. Yep that's right. I gave up the greatest from Google and a very premium made Honor 8. The reason?Number 1-the feel and size are just right. Its just a joy to use and carry.Number 2- i immediately realized that this phone is just as fast as the z5 compact and I'm not sure what they did but this phone is silky smooth, almost iphone like. You have some hang ups like every other Android like in the play Store but overall I am really impressed with the performance. That just shows that specs are not everything and there is something to be said for real optimization.Number - 3 price. It was dropped to $399 when I bought mine. Compared to the pixel, it's half the price.I'm no Camara guru so I can't really speak on this too much but it does take some real nice shots in good light. Low light will not be the best.Many people are bashing because the phone isn't waterproof but it doesn't bother me.*edit. It's frustrating when someone gives one star and is not even talking about this phone!! The X compact does NOT have a cover for the USB!!!! This proves that the reviewer is ignorant. Amazon needs to monitor these reviews better!!"
"391331","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Mist Blue (US Warranty)",4,"This is by no means a perfect phone but this is really the best you can get for a small android phone. Almost all the phone manufacturers have dismissed making a small phone in favor of their 5+ inch slabs. I started using androids with a Moto X 2013, which to me was the perfect 4.7 inch phone if you disregard the crappy camera that it had. Unfortunately, Motorola decided bigger is better with their later models, and now the their Chinese overlords that currently own them have pretty much stated that they have no plans of making a small phone again. In fact, they have gone full retard with them making their current phones even bigger and wider.After the Moto X started slowing down after a few drops and age, I ""upgraded"" to the new Moto G 2015, which was not too bad in terms of screen height at 5 inches, but the width of this tubby made it hard to handle with one hand. Not to mention that is was a downgrade from the beautiful AMOLED screen from the Moto X. My camera and LED light crapped out after I dropped my Moto G so I got the Xperia X Compact after some research.Now the nice things about this phone:- Screen: I'm not much of a high res snob but 720p works for this size and it looks much better than my Moto G which had that resolution for 5 inches. Just wish this was an AMOLED for those nice dark blacks.- Memory: I've felt no slowdowns as far as RAM when multitasking. For regular storage you have 32GB which is enough for most people but you can also expand it 256 GB more with a micro SD.- Camera: Best camera that I've had which is not saying much given what my previous phones are. Other people would probably be more credible than me since I never but too much importance on this function but these pictures do look sweet.- Speed: Feels a hell of a lot snappier than my previous phone which is really no surprise with the superior processor. Apparently, the lower resolution gives it a faster speed than say a 1080p would.- Button placement: Yes, I actually like where the sound buttons are placed. I use my phones left handed (even though I'm right handed) and the button placement for volume is actually not awkward as it would be for a right handed user. This doubles as a convenient zoom in and out button for the camera.- Double front facing speakers: A rarity these days, especially for this phone size. Very high quality audio too.-Battery life: About 40-60% at the end of a day which is pretty good for me but this will depend on the person and what apps they are using.Not so great things:- Exterior design: Could have used a more matte, less slippery design. Shows fingerprints. All this can be fixed with a skin but this should not have been necessary. Ergonomics are inferior to the curved Motorola and Samsung designs for handling, while this did improve from the previous blocky Sony phones by curving the sides, they could have done better.Price: This isn't too bad now that Sony has put down the crack pipe and lowered the price from their initial 500 dollar tag.Neutral things:- Lack of fingerprint scanner: This can actually be enabled by reflashing to the UK version which is what I did. Does appear to show less bars on reception as mentioned by a previous reviewer but the connection seems to work just fine. Would not recommend doing this for everyone but do it at your own risk or just buy the international version.-No waterproofing: More accurately, this is not warrantied as being waterproof. YouTube videos have shown that this is actually pretty water resistant and that Sony most likely just doesn't want to cover claims.Say what you will about Sony, while they are deserving of much criticism for their reported crappy customer service and overpricing of their phones, they are the only ones in the android market that are meeting a neglected segment by making a decent phone that is easy to handle one handed, that has a near stock android feel, and actually has the back and recent keys on the correct sides (looking at you Samsung).Note: Still in early ownership and will update if there are any snags."
"391332","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Mist Blue (US Warranty)",5,"I wanted a smaller phone than my last one (One Plus). This one is the perfect size for me. Small enough to fit in my pocket, but not so small you can't do anything on it. I really like the light blue color. So far, I have no complaints (I've had it for about a month). It takes great pictures too! I am very happy with my purchase."
"391333","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Mist Blue (US Warranty)",5,"I realy so happy. It is so fast and nice phone. I used iphone 7 plus but it so big .the best compact phone . I love X compact."
"391334","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Mist Blue (US Warranty)",3,"Good phone. Terrible customer service from Amazon."
"391335","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Mist Blue (US Warranty)",4,"I've only had it a few days, so if I can remember I'll return to update this review some weeks from now. Thus far, I'm loving this little thing.On the outside, this thing is a really sleek device. I dislike the fingerprint magnet nature of the surface but it's not that big a deal to me. Aside from that, it feels substantive and of good quality despite being made of plastic. The screen is fantastic; the size and resolution, the colors, the brightness. I love it having USB type C, even if it is still at USB 2.0 speeds. While also on the thicker size (9.5 mm if I recall correctly), it still feels diminutive and nice in the hand. The camera... I'm mixed about. I tried taking some seemingly easy auto photos and got somewhat bad results, whereas my Lumia 950 and Honor 8 produced some consistently great shots. Like the Lumia 950, I LOVE that this has a shutter button.On the inside, the Snapdragon 650 positively *sings* on this paired with 3 GB RAM. Everything is so quick, speedy, and nicely animated. Software seems to be just about stock Android 6.0 and it shows. Battery life so far has been great, but that largely depends on the radios and whatever signal strength you're getting on a given day (seems better than the 950 or Honor 8, truthfully).Of significant note since this is the US model: THE FINGERPRINT SENSOR IS STILL THERE, BUT DISABLED THROUGH SOFTWARE. I was able to get the UK version of the software onto this one and it actually works. Search for it; there should be a thread on XDA forums that explains it. There is a perceived drop in cell reception (going from 5 bars and LTE indicator in the US to 4 bars and simple 4G indicator in the UK). It's odd, just earlier I was browsing the internet with great speed on only 1 bar of 4G; this leads me to believe that 1.) 4G here can indicate LTE but just doesn't show it, and 2.) one bar of '4G' isn't actually all that bad. Again, this is with the UK software. Great experience so far! (:"
"391336","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Mist Blue (US Warranty)",4,"I purchased this phone about two weeks ago. This is my first android phone after switching from an iPhone 6. I've been pleasantly surprised by the phone so far. The andorid version on it seems decent and it works pretty well. The battery life is similar to my iPhone 6, with slightly better life when making phone calls and worse when doing a lot of data heavy tasks in facebook, twitter, google plus, email programs and browsing. It makes it easily through a day for me.Most of my issues so far have not been with the phone itself, but rather other services I want to use.For example, I haven't had any luck getting the AT&T visual voicemail app working with this phone. This was one of the few killer iOS features i miss and I feel like it should be built into android rather than apps for each phone company that suck and have a whitelist. This isn't sony's fault aside from their lack of a deal with any major carier in the US.The second issue is a lack of decent cases for the phone. Most of the ones on amazon so far have been cheap, soft cases that don't really hold up well. The screen protectors work as I had a drop the other day and it did take a chunk out of the protector but the phone is fine. I think I'm spoiled from owning an iphone for so many years, but a decent leather case would be much appreciated. Sony should offer some kind of case for it at least or make a deal for them.Finally, the text messaging app that is default with the phone isn't very good. This is easy to fix on android, but then I wasn't sure what to use. Many apps support it and I didn't see a feature matrix to know what to use. In this case, I think sony should consider a better default messaging app.The camera on the phone is decent, but I had hoped for a bit more. It's not as good in darker rooms as my iPhone was. It's also very bad when there is a lot of motion. For the price difference, this isn't a deal breaker for me but if you're really into photos this might not be the phone for you.A lot of people have asked me about the phone and commented on the appearance. Many people are impressed by the screen quality. I was as well. It's quite vivid.I do wish sony would fix their policy about not offering fingerprint scanning in the US. I miss that from my iphone.Another small headache was that contact imports were a problem. AT&T offered a tool to migrate and it was great for photos but only could grab 75 contacts. I had around 300. I ended up doing an export from icloud and then importing using google's contacts website. Most instructions online assume that you have a GMAIL account associated with google. In my case, I have a non google email account and it required finding this contacts site to actually work. The google site also cleaned up some duplicates from the AT&T import which was nice. Sony also has an app which I didn't try for contacts. It may have worked better. I'd recommend people just go right for the google site approach, especially if they don't need pictures imported.The location services are a bit buggy. I have it set to unlock my phone if it is at my house and it doesn't work sometimes. I don't know if that is an android issue or the phone GPS. The iphone was smart enough to realize if i was near my wifi i was home. I wish this phone understood that.Lastly, I had some issues with email. The stock app can connect to regular IMAP accounts fine. It works good for that. I also had a work GMAIL account with a custom domain and an exchange email account for grad school email. I didn't even try to use gmail from that app so I can't comment on that. I setup google gmail app. However, on my old iphone i had all but work mail setup in apple mail. With this phone, if i try to use exchange it tries to lock down the phone and won't allow any other email accounts to be setup. If I use microsoft outlook app, it works fine. I think this is a combination of a domain setup fail and the app. It shouldn't require those strict limitations on the email app if outlook works! This means I have 3 different mail programs to check 4 accounts. Kind of annoying."
"391337","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Mist Blue (US Warranty)",5,"Great product,"
"391338","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Mist Blue (US Warranty)",3,"The phone itself is fine; the camera does well with moving subjects and low light situations. The bloatware is worse than Nexus or Motorola/Moto devices, but closer to stock Android than any other carrier's. The sound is great, and though the screen was a little hard to get used to after using a larger phone, being able to comfortably use a phone with one hand again really is pretty nice. I can't speak to how it compares to other Sony phones, since this is the first one I've owned; after so long on stock Android, it took some getting used to, but installing the Google Keyboard helped a lot (I rely on the swipe-from-backspace to delete words/phrases quite a lot, and I never want to go back). The dedicated two-stage shutter button is nice, and does a good job of starting the camera without any fuss; though it wasn't quite as quick as I expected, it's still under a second.What I failed to notice (and still can't find on this product page) is that this is the international version. Which means the fingerprint sensor works (really well), it is compatible with more radio bands, and oh yeah- starts in Chinese, which makes all the ""Getting started"" prompts a nightmare to get through. This seller also was nice enough to include a ""travel adapter,"" since without it, you wouldn't be able to charge this phone in the U.S. I'm always hesitant to buy products on Amazon from third-party vendors, and these guys (NGP STORE USA) are a good example of why. If literally any of this had been in the description, I may have still purchased the phone. I certainly wouldn't have been so frustrated when I powered on the phone, and could've bought a separate OEM charger ahead of time.At least they shipped quickly.Bottom line is: decent phone, great camera, as small as advertised (for better or worse), working fingerprint sensor, great if you speak Chinese, buy a separate charger, or purchase from Amazon directly."
"391339","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Mist Blue (US Warranty)",5,"Excellent small footprint smart phone, just what I was looking for. Camera seems powerful once it's mastered. Ability to preserve battery power when not used is better than any previous phone I've had. The remaining question is durability."
"391340","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Mist Blue (US Warranty)",4,"It's a nice phone just wish it was smaller in a little more thinner. the os is way smoother and faster than my z5 compact but overall I like it ."
"391341","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Mist Blue (US Warranty)",2,"The X compact feels slower, is not waterproof, is thicker, has an inconvenient USB-C port, has a camera which seems equal or poorer (especially in low light), and generally is not an upgrade in any sense of the word. Two positives: the black/blue color is beautiful, and the screen may be slightly superior. Not enough: upgrades need to be superior, Sony!"
"391342","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Mist Blue (US Warranty)",3,"Is this phone 4G LTE. I have it activated by ATT and not able to get the 4G signal after several calls to their customer service."
"391343","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Mist Blue (US Warranty)",5,"This is one of the few flagship phones that still comes in a compact form factor, but with the smaller size you're not actually giving up much at all. It's also cheaper than a lot of other flagships to boot. Battery life on this is amazing, probably close to 8-9 hours of screen on time. If it doesn't get used much all day, then it'll easily have over 80% charge left at night. Reminds me of old Nokia phones in that regard: excellent battery life and power management.The build quality is really solid. The screen is mildly curved on the edges (but not nearly as much as many other curved screens), giving it that little bit extra of a 'fancy' feel. The white color is also really unique. Doesn't come with a lot of bloatware at all, it's quick, snappy, multitasks well, and the camera is pretty fine too.Overall, probably the single best option if you're looking for a compact flagship-level phone in 2016 (and likely well into 2017), and actually gives many full-sized flagship phones a run too."
"391344","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - White (US Warranty)",5,"Sony gets a lot of flak for this phone using the 650 chipset but honestly I am glad they did. There are no heat issues and the phone is blazing fast. Being a compact the phone feels great in the hand and there is no more ""hand shimmy"" needed to get to everything on the screen. Not to mention that it doesn't take up all of your pocket real estate if you like keeping your phone in the front. Needless to say the battery life is also amazing. This will get you through all day usage and then some even if you watch a movie or two on netflix. If your looking for a solid one hander with great performance and long battery life this is it."
"391345","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - White (US Warranty)",3,"I have problems with the phone. Only work for one day and I called Sony to help me but they could not. So at this point I need to return the phone"
"391346","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - White (US Warranty)",5,"I have a small palm and short fingers, it fits perfectly. Feels very solid and looks very pleasing. Love the UI experience."
"391347","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - White (US Warranty)",4,"Since most others have already reviewed the major specs, I'll just touch on the two features that I was the most curious about but no one else seemed to review.Camera speed: So I'm a pet parent, and as every pet parent knows, shutter speed is extremely important when it comes to catching that oh-so-cute face your pup or kitty (I have both) are making at you before they ruin it with a yawn or getting distracted by a squirrel. My last phone (Galaxy SIII) was super quick at taking photos, even if they were blurred from the motion. I decided against the Xperia Z5 compact because of all the reviews on the slow camera speed. The X Compact appears to load the camera much quicker than what I saw in videos for the Z5 Compact, especially if you load by double clicking the power button. (it's a slower load via the dedicated camera button.) The shutter speed, however, is quicker than my husband's Xperia Z3 flagship, but still slower than my Galaxy S III. Even so, the auto focus does act pretty quickly, and it seems quicker the better the lighting is. The picture quality is pretty good, though, except that the colors are on the bluish side in dim lighting.Speakerphone quality: How is it 2016 and speakerphone quality is worse than before?! Maybe it's a Sony problem. Husband's Z3 is barely audible on speakerphone, and the X Compact made only slight improvement. It's audible when it's dead quiet around you, but less so when I'm walking the dog outside, and near impossible when I'm in the car. What's the big deal about these front facing speakers if I can't hear the other person very well?! (note: speakers seem to be great for playing videos and games.)Phone still gets 4 stars because of all the other nice features everyone else had already reviewed. But wanted to share about those two points since they are not often talked about."
"391348","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - White (US Warranty)",5,"Sexy, sexy phone! Camera needs some patience, but end results are wonderful!"
"391349","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - White (US Warranty)",4,"If you are looking for a mid sized phone you can use with one hand in October of 2016 this phone is your best option.Pros:- Phone fits in one hand- Battery life lasts all day and in some cases two days- Phone works great on T-mobile's network while also having band 12 for faster LTE (Works well on AT&T too)- UI is smooth and doesn't lag with a minimalist skin over stock android- No overheating issues like z5 compact- Android 7.0 N due to release in November- USB C with quick charge 3.0- Expandable memory- Front facing speakersCons- Plastic doesn't feel as premium like the s7 and iphone 7- Fairly thick for a phone made in 2016- Camera is adequate but has trouble in low light and tends to overexpose in daylight- No amoled display- Volume buttons are too low although they function well when using the camera- No fingerprint sensor with US version- No waterproofing- Black is more of a dark blueIt's unfortunate that the market is saturated with so many phablets and we have very little choice when it comes to conservatively sized devices but all in all I think this is a good phone that you won't regret buying if you are wanting a moderately sized phone"
"391350","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - White (US Warranty)",3,"I got it in ""Midnight Black"" They should have called it Navy Blue!? Why Sony? It bugs me, because it really is blue. I own both Xperia Z3 and Z5 and I think I'll send the XC back. It's very nice, comfortable to hold and the buttons are a little more out of the way. But the processor is faster on the Z5 and the rest of the specs aren't hugely different. If it was only truly black I'd probably keep it although there is a lot of plastic on it."
"391351","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - White (US Warranty)",3,"This phone is basically the same as Sony Xperia Z5 Compact. Only upside: 1GB more ram. Downsides: not waterproof, slower processor, USB-C instead of standard Micro-USB, more expensive.At this price point Z5 Compact international model (that has fingerprint scanner) feels like a much better purchase."
"391352","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - White (US Warranty)",5,"Starting off, I'm coming from a Nexus 5 (2013) and I primarily got this phone because the Nexus was getting a bit long in the tooth, so this is a big jump for me in terms of phones and I think it's great overall. I chose the X Compact (over, let's say, the new Moto phones or the Pixel phones about to come out) primarily due to its smaller size as well as its design (though the X Compact was definitely in the upper limit of what I was willing to pay for a new phone); I rather enjoy the simple, clean design of it with the curves along the long edges. Looking at just the specs, it does seem overpriced (I got this at a pretty nice deal, though), but I ultimately enjoy the purchase.My pros and cons are coming from a user that doesn't play games, nor watch too many videos or listen to music too much. I just use it for chatting with friends and communicating with co workers (e.g. text, e-mail, etc), and browsing everyone's favorite news aggregator. Sprinkle in some photo taking, reading the news, and that's pretty much all I use my smartphone for, so my expectations are set accordingly.Pros:+ Clean, simple design with a nice color+ Nice pocketable size+ 720p screen looks great+ Speedy performance for what I need/want+ Dual front facing speakers+ Camera seems nice (I haven't tested it too rigorously yet, however)+ Good battery life (easily lasts me a day with 40% left, but again, I'm not a heavy user)+ Fast charging, and USB C is nice (though I guess I have to get an adapter for all my micro USB chargers)+ Great, lightly skinned Android with 7.0 Nougat updates confirmed (albeit sometime in November, I think?)I can't think of too many cons since I'm not exactly the pickiest, and I'm still in the honeymoon stage with this phone.Cons:- Bit expensive for the hardware you get compared to other phones- Some bloatware that can't be uninstalled, but you can hide them from your apps drawer- Speakers aren't the loudest- Not too many accessories out yet (e.g. cases, screen protectors)Again, I really like this phone, but if you're looking for a phone with top of the line specs or something of comparable specs to this one at a lower price point, you may want to look elsewhere (e.g. OnePlus 3, Moto G4 family, Nexus 5X/6P, etc). I'll try to update this in a month or two, however, when I can probably be a bit more discerning. Hope this helps!"
"391353","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - White (US Warranty)",4,"I use this phone for few hours and found how fast the battery dies after my iPhone SE. But this is not the biggest problem (I assume I'll not use so hard phone in next days). There is no WiFi calling on T-Mobile and may be VoLTE on this phone. At least, I couldn't find it...Updated WiFi: thanks to comments and also talked to T-Mobile representative - WiFi calling is not SONY's problem. So, I'm adding one more star to Sony, take one from T-Mobile :)"
"391354","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - White (US Warranty)",5,"This phone is very sleek and beautiful, it's fast and does everything it supposed to without lagging. It's a good phone for the price. However, it's a big annoying that Sony doesn't send out headphones with the phone, but that's alright. It comes with the faster charging wall plug, and I've noticed that the phone does charge way faster when it's connected to the plug. The speakers on this phone aren't the best, they're ok though. Not very loud, but they are clear sounding. The cameras are not that good in low light, but everything else about the phone is an A+."
"391355","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - White (US Warranty)",5,"Love it.It's a great sizeUI is fastBattery life is excellent (usually use 30-50%/day)Screen is very good, don't let the releativly low resolution be a deterent, it's quite good even looking at very small detail.The built-in Sony apps can be somewhat annoying and not all can be uninstalled, but just hide them in a folder and turn off notification and they dont bother you.My only concerns are more with Andriod than anything Sony did. The privacy controls are insuffient, too much reliancy on google and it's qutie a hassle to disable cloud based data sharing. (On the positive side you don't need any relationship with Sony to use everything, a Sony account and cloud services can be skipped on startup and settings).As others have noted, this is the US SKU. That means it's missing 2 features: 1 no fingerprint reader, and 2 no smart battery control. Most people know about the first one, but the lack of smart battery control is hidden in the manual. This means no ""learning your habits"" and charging a less than a max speed. Because of this I don't plugin my phone overnight because I don't want it to charge to 100% or do so at a rapid speed, both of which lessen your battery life in the long term."

"391357","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - White (US Warranty)",5,"I recently purchased the White US version of the X Compact for $350 after a great two years with this phone’s grandfather the Z3C. After debating whether to purchase the X Compact, Galaxy S7, Google Pixel and Honor 8, I’m quite happy with my decision. There have been some extremely critical reviews of the device - discrediting it as no longer being the compact flagship, but for the niche market that enjoys small-form factor android phones, the device is top of class. This review will highlight some of the unique features that I’ve encountered as well as addressing some of the harsh criticisms I’ve seen in other reviews.Design:I’ve always been a fan of Sony’s clean and minimalist design language for its Xperia line and this phone is no exception. In a market where every phone seems to have a utilitarian brushed metal or flashy, shiny design, the white model of this phone is a refreshing change. The looped edges (which are very akin to the Lumia Windows Phones) and small size of the device offer the perfect dimensions for one handed operation without performing a balancing act with your fingers. The 2.5D curved glass that seamlessly loops into to back of the unit which offers a unique feeling I’ve never experienced. The phone also does a great job of catching the light in interesting ways and it's been the first phone I’ve used that has literally turned heads when walking down the street.Build:Many people have been really harsh on this phone for having a plastic rear. While it is true that it can be easily scratched, I think Sony has gracefully addressed one of the biggest complaints of their previous lines while keeping true to their design aesthetic. Let me explain: the two predecessors to this phone, the Z3C and Z5C both had glass panels on the rear of the phone. While elegant and more scratch resistant than plastic, the phones were prone to spontaneous cracking, even while in a case. Sony could have gone the route of using a metal back, but at the cost of poor reception or having a plastic chin (like the Xperia XZ), but it would go against their clean slab design language they’ve retained for the previous lines. As someone who has always used his phone with a case or a skin, having the plastic back is not a problem for me.Another pain-point with this phone has been the lack of waterproofing that the Xperia line has become iconic for. After seeing videos online of people verifying the waterproofing and testing for myself, I can confirm that this phone is in fact waterproof. I can’t make any claims for the actual ingress rating, but I’ve been able to use my phone in the shower everyday since purchasing the phone without problems. My theory is the Sony omitted waterproofing as a an on-paper feature for this phone because it new that labor costs of repairing warranty claims for the device would not be cost effective for the volume sold to the US and UK markets, where larger devices reign supreme. If that isn’t evidence enough, the X Compact in Asian markets have the waterproof rating where smaller phones are more popular and where Sony has more resources to make warranty claims.The final pain-point I’ve seen with this phone is the fact that the US version does not have a fingerprint scanner. It does indeed have a fingerprint scanner, but because of a patent conflict with Hewlett-Packard, Sony had to disable it for the US markets. If you’re willing to get your hands dirty with android development, you can actually download and install the signed, UK firmware of the phone to enable the fingerprint scanner. As a plus, since the firmware is official and signed by Sony, you will not lose your warranty if you conduct the procedure. And what a fingerprint scanner it is. The scanner is extremely accurate, placed in the perfect position and unlocks my phone before I even I can even pull it out of my pocket.As for the rest of the phone, the device has the signature dual front facing speakers that are a huge improvement from the Z3C speakers. They won’t wow anyone with their loudness, but they’re perfect having crisp clean audio for sharing media with friends. The camera button is always welcomed and has a tactile dual click to allow focus lock before capture when taking pictures. The volume controls, on the other hand are in an awkward place. Sony has a tendency to place the volume buttons close to the camera shutter for use as a zoom keys, but I’ve noticed that I more often than not pinch the screen to zoom in so I would love to see those keys moved to the upper-left side of the device.Display:This is hands down one of the most gorgeous displays I have ever used. I’ve held this phone up to a Google Pixel (which has an AMOLED screen) and this device can go toe-to-toe with the Pixel’s Brightness and Saturation despite having a LCD panel screen. It's absolutely incredible how beautiful the display is. The colors are juicy and watching movies on the device is. That being said,unfortunately because it is an LCD panel it cannot achieve the absolute blackness that an AMOLED screen can. For me, it’s not noticeable enough to bother me but I can see how that could be an issue for people coming from AMOLED devices.Many people have been hyper-critical of the fact that this phone uses a 720p display in 2016. A 720p display is perfect for a display this size. iPhones have had similar resolutions for years without any complaint. Here is a comparison with the current gen iPhone handsets:iPhone SE: 4.0inch Screen at 1136 x 640 (320 pixels per inch)X Compact: 4.6inch Screen at 1280 x 720 (319 pixels per inch)iPhone 7: 4.7inch Screen at 1334 x 750 (326 pixels per inch)Yes, you can get Android phones with 400+ pixels per inch, but why have a screen that is more demanding on performance and battery life if you can’t even discern the individuals with the naked eye? Sony has realized this and chose the optimum screen for the form factor.Performance:Many people have criticized the fact that this device uses a Snapdragon 650 Processor instead of an 820 like its big brother. I think Sony chose this processor for a couple reasons. The smaller resolution of the X Compact means that similar rendering performance can be achieved with a scaled back processor. The 650 is also more power efficient than its big brother, which allows it to achieve the ludicrous battery life that the Compact line is known for. Yes this phone might not have the same raw performance numbers as some of the other top of the line phones on the market, but I have yet to experience any hiccups in any applications I’ve tried. And at the end of the day, isn’t that what really matters?Photo-Quality:This is still one of the primary reasons why I buy Sony phones. Sony devices have one of the most powerful imaging devices for android - if you know how to dial in the settings. The 23 MP Camera allows for fidelity I’ve never been able to achieve in any phone I’ve tried. The camera app has all of the controls you’d expect from a DSLR, but in a compact size. One of the biggest improvements from the previous camera app is the ability to control shutter speed now. Also, compared to the Z3C, the automatic mode is much better at finding the right settings for the current scene. Handheld and low-light pictures are also much clearer thanks to the new laser auto-focus and improved capture speed. I can speak for the camera all day long, but I’ll just attach some pictures so you can see for yourself.Battery Life:This is the most battery efficient smart phone I’ve ever used. My usage habits typically involve using GPS and streaming music on my way to work, checking social media, news and dating apps throughout the day, photo taking in the afternoon and casting media in the evening. I would consider myself someone with heavy use with the exception of playing 3D games. I’ve been able to go from 8am to 10pm with over 40% battery left without any active battery saving features.I’ve always been a huge fan of Sony’s built in battery saving features. I’ve tested the device with Stamina Enabled for the full duration of the battery and a more normal usage pattern, and it is a breeze to get up to 3 full days of use. If you want to stretch it even further, you can turn on Ultra Stamina Mode which turns off all your apps sans the basic. With that mode enabled, my phone has predicted that it can go up to 2 weeks.Software:Sony’s build of android is almost entirely stock save a couple of power saving features and some bloatware. Sony’s own included apps have varying degrees of use. Sony makes one of the best Album apps I’ve used but things like LifeLog, Xperia Lounge and What’s New I could do without. As for the third party software, Sony actually includes some useful ones including Amazon Shopping and Swiftkey. Luckily if there is anything you don’t like, you can easily disable any apps you don’t like.Accessories:One of the biggest downfalls for the device is the accessory support. Two things I usually buy when I get a new phone are a tempered glass screen protector and a Ringke Fusion Case. Because of the negative reception to the phone and low volume, many of the common accessory manufacturers have elected to pass up this device in their production line up. In my attempts to find a screen protector, I’ve been unable to find any that have a complete adhesive hold to the entire screen; the screen protectors either omit the curved edges or screen protectors that only attach from adhesive on the edges, leaving a noticeable air gap between the screen and protector. Thus, I’ve had to resort to using Skinomi’s screen protector in the interim. Unfortunately Ringke does not have any plans to make their Fusion case for this device, but I was able to find the MicroP TPU case which achieves some similar design aesthetics as the Ringke cases.TLDR:Pros:- Beautiful design- Small form factor phone- Beautiful display- Fast fingerprint sensor- Unofficial but present waterproofing- Insane battery life- Great cameraCons:- Very little accessory support (Cases / screen protectors)- Activating fingerprint sensor requires some tinkering- Volume buttons in an awkward location for use with volumeVerdict:The Xperia X Compact is one of the best options if you’re looking for a small form factor phone with an excellent camera and battery life. This phone does have its fair share of nuances that make it less approachable than offerings by Samsung, Xiaomi and Google, but with a little work you can turn the device into an absolute pleasure to use."
"391358","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - White (US Warranty)",5,"I chose this phone because of it's smaller, more portable size, and it has worked perfectly so far. It has many new, up to date features with the same reliability as any other android. Shipping was fast and efficient, and the box comes with everything you need to get started. This is a great phone from a great company, and I would recommend it to anyone!"
"391359","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - White (US Warranty)",4,"This phone is great and simple to work. I bought it to replace my Japanese phone that the company wouldn't allow me to upgrade. The only issue with this cell phone is it is not Japan certified so mobile data does not work with it."
"391360","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - White (US Warranty)",5,"The Sony compact series has always been my go to for an Android phone because of the size and speed. The previous compacts were based on the latest and greatest highest end chip set at the time of their releases. When this phone was announced as having the SD 650, I was more than disappointed so I wrote the phone off. I wasn't sure which phone to get so I bought an iPhone 7 which lasted a couple weeks until I remembered how restricted ios was. I then had three options for a smallish phone. The Honor 8.. Still a little large, the Google pixel.. Expensive! and the Sony X compact. I had all three within about a month. I kept the X compact. Yep that's right. I gave up the greatest from Google and a very premium made Honor 8. The reason?Number 1-the feel and size are just right. Its just a joy to use and carry.Number 2- i immediately realized that this phone is just as fast as the z5 compact and I'm not sure what they did but this phone is silky smooth, almost iphone like. You have some hang ups like every other Android like in the play Store but overall I am really impressed with the performance. That just shows that specs are not everything and there is something to be said for real optimization.Number - 3 price. It was dropped to $399 when I bought mine. Compared to the pixel, it's half the price.I'm no Camara guru so I can't really speak on this too much but it does take some real nice shots in good light. Low light will not be the best.Many people are bashing because the phone isn't waterproof but it doesn't bother me.*edit. It's frustrating when someone gives one star and is not even talking about this phone!! The X compact does NOT have a cover for the USB!!!! This proves that the reviewer is ignorant. Amazon needs to monitor these reviews better!!"
"391361","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - White (US Warranty)",4,"This is by no means a perfect phone but this is really the best you can get for a small android phone. Almost all the phone manufacturers have dismissed making a small phone in favor of their 5+ inch slabs. I started using androids with a Moto X 2013, which to me was the perfect 4.7 inch phone if you disregard the crappy camera that it had. Unfortunately, Motorola decided bigger is better with their later models, and now the their Chinese overlords that currently own them have pretty much stated that they have no plans of making a small phone again. In fact, they have gone full retard with them making their current phones even bigger and wider.After the Moto X started slowing down after a few drops and age, I ""upgraded"" to the new Moto G 2015, which was not too bad in terms of screen height at 5 inches, but the width of this tubby made it hard to handle with one hand. Not to mention that is was a downgrade from the beautiful AMOLED screen from the Moto X. My camera and LED light crapped out after I dropped my Moto G so I got the Xperia X Compact after some research.Now the nice things about this phone:- Screen: I'm not much of a high res snob but 720p works for this size and it looks much better than my Moto G which had that resolution for 5 inches. Just wish this was an AMOLED for those nice dark blacks.- Memory: I've felt no slowdowns as far as RAM when multitasking. For regular storage you have 32GB which is enough for most people but you can also expand it 256 GB more with a micro SD.- Camera: Best camera that I've had which is not saying much given what my previous phones are. Other people would probably be more credible than me since I never but too much importance on this function but these pictures do look sweet.- Speed: Feels a hell of a lot snappier than my previous phone which is really no surprise with the superior processor. Apparently, the lower resolution gives it a faster speed than say a 1080p would.- Button placement: Yes, I actually like where the sound buttons are placed. I use my phones left handed (even though I'm right handed) and the button placement for volume is actually not awkward as it would be for a right handed user. This doubles as a convenient zoom in and out button for the camera.- Double front facing speakers: A rarity these days, especially for this phone size. Very high quality audio too.-Battery life: About 40-60% at the end of a day which is pretty good for me but this will depend on the person and what apps they are using.Not so great things:- Exterior design: Could have used a more matte, less slippery design. Shows fingerprints. All this can be fixed with a skin but this should not have been necessary. Ergonomics are inferior to the curved Motorola and Samsung designs for handling, while this did improve from the previous blocky Sony phones by curving the sides, they could have done better.Price: This isn't too bad now that Sony has put down the crack pipe and lowered the price from their initial 500 dollar tag.Neutral things:- Lack of fingerprint scanner: This can actually be enabled by reflashing to the UK version which is what I did. Does appear to show less bars on reception as mentioned by a previous reviewer but the connection seems to work just fine. Would not recommend doing this for everyone but do it at your own risk or just buy the international version.-No waterproofing: More accurately, this is not warrantied as being waterproof. YouTube videos have shown that this is actually pretty water resistant and that Sony most likely just doesn't want to cover claims.Say what you will about Sony, while they are deserving of much criticism for their reported crappy customer service and overpricing of their phones, they are the only ones in the android market that are meeting a neglected segment by making a decent phone that is easy to handle one handed, that has a near stock android feel, and actually has the back and recent keys on the correct sides (looking at you Samsung).Note: Still in early ownership and will update if there are any snags."
"391362","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - White (US Warranty)",5,"I wanted a smaller phone than my last one (One Plus). This one is the perfect size for me. Small enough to fit in my pocket, but not so small you can't do anything on it. I really like the light blue color. So far, I have no complaints (I've had it for about a month). It takes great pictures too! I am very happy with my purchase."
"391363","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - White (US Warranty)",5,"I realy so happy. It is so fast and nice phone. I used iphone 7 plus but it so big .the best compact phone . I love X compact."
"391364","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - White (US Warranty)",3,"Good phone. Terrible customer service from Amazon."
"391365","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - White (US Warranty)",4,"I've only had it a few days, so if I can remember I'll return to update this review some weeks from now. Thus far, I'm loving this little thing.On the outside, this thing is a really sleek device. I dislike the fingerprint magnet nature of the surface but it's not that big a deal to me. Aside from that, it feels substantive and of good quality despite being made of plastic. The screen is fantastic; the size and resolution, the colors, the brightness. I love it having USB type C, even if it is still at USB 2.0 speeds. While also on the thicker size (9.5 mm if I recall correctly), it still feels diminutive and nice in the hand. The camera... I'm mixed about. I tried taking some seemingly easy auto photos and got somewhat bad results, whereas my Lumia 950 and Honor 8 produced some consistently great shots. Like the Lumia 950, I LOVE that this has a shutter button.On the inside, the Snapdragon 650 positively *sings* on this paired with 3 GB RAM. Everything is so quick, speedy, and nicely animated. Software seems to be just about stock Android 6.0 and it shows. Battery life so far has been great, but that largely depends on the radios and whatever signal strength you're getting on a given day (seems better than the 950 or Honor 8, truthfully).Of significant note since this is the US model: THE FINGERPRINT SENSOR IS STILL THERE, BUT DISABLED THROUGH SOFTWARE. I was able to get the UK version of the software onto this one and it actually works. Search for it; there should be a thread on XDA forums that explains it. There is a perceived drop in cell reception (going from 5 bars and LTE indicator in the US to 4 bars and simple 4G indicator in the UK). It's odd, just earlier I was browsing the internet with great speed on only 1 bar of 4G; this leads me to believe that 1.) 4G here can indicate LTE but just doesn't show it, and 2.) one bar of '4G' isn't actually all that bad. Again, this is with the UK software. Great experience so far! (:"
"391366","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - White (US Warranty)",4,"I purchased this phone about two weeks ago. This is my first android phone after switching from an iPhone 6. I've been pleasantly surprised by the phone so far. The andorid version on it seems decent and it works pretty well. The battery life is similar to my iPhone 6, with slightly better life when making phone calls and worse when doing a lot of data heavy tasks in facebook, twitter, google plus, email programs and browsing. It makes it easily through a day for me.Most of my issues so far have not been with the phone itself, but rather other services I want to use.For example, I haven't had any luck getting the AT&T visual voicemail app working with this phone. This was one of the few killer iOS features i miss and I feel like it should be built into android rather than apps for each phone company that suck and have a whitelist. This isn't sony's fault aside from their lack of a deal with any major carier in the US.The second issue is a lack of decent cases for the phone. Most of the ones on amazon so far have been cheap, soft cases that don't really hold up well. The screen protectors work as I had a drop the other day and it did take a chunk out of the protector but the phone is fine. I think I'm spoiled from owning an iphone for so many years, but a decent leather case would be much appreciated. Sony should offer some kind of case for it at least or make a deal for them.Finally, the text messaging app that is default with the phone isn't very good. This is easy to fix on android, but then I wasn't sure what to use. Many apps support it and I didn't see a feature matrix to know what to use. In this case, I think sony should consider a better default messaging app.The camera on the phone is decent, but I had hoped for a bit more. It's not as good in darker rooms as my iPhone was. It's also very bad when there is a lot of motion. For the price difference, this isn't a deal breaker for me but if you're really into photos this might not be the phone for you.A lot of people have asked me about the phone and commented on the appearance. Many people are impressed by the screen quality. I was as well. It's quite vivid.I do wish sony would fix their policy about not offering fingerprint scanning in the US. I miss that from my iphone.Another small headache was that contact imports were a problem. AT&T offered a tool to migrate and it was great for photos but only could grab 75 contacts. I had around 300. I ended up doing an export from icloud and then importing using google's contacts website. Most instructions online assume that you have a GMAIL account associated with google. In my case, I have a non google email account and it required finding this contacts site to actually work. The google site also cleaned up some duplicates from the AT&T import which was nice. Sony also has an app which I didn't try for contacts. It may have worked better. I'd recommend people just go right for the google site approach, especially if they don't need pictures imported.The location services are a bit buggy. I have it set to unlock my phone if it is at my house and it doesn't work sometimes. I don't know if that is an android issue or the phone GPS. The iphone was smart enough to realize if i was near my wifi i was home. I wish this phone understood that.Lastly, I had some issues with email. The stock app can connect to regular IMAP accounts fine. It works good for that. I also had a work GMAIL account with a custom domain and an exchange email account for grad school email. I didn't even try to use gmail from that app so I can't comment on that. I setup google gmail app. However, on my old iphone i had all but work mail setup in apple mail. With this phone, if i try to use exchange it tries to lock down the phone and won't allow any other email accounts to be setup. If I use microsoft outlook app, it works fine. I think this is a combination of a domain setup fail and the app. It shouldn't require those strict limitations on the email app if outlook works! This means I have 3 different mail programs to check 4 accounts. Kind of annoying."
"391367","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - White (US Warranty)",5,"Great product,"
"391368","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - White (US Warranty)",3,"The phone itself is fine; the camera does well with moving subjects and low light situations. The bloatware is worse than Nexus or Motorola/Moto devices, but closer to stock Android than any other carrier's. The sound is great, and though the screen was a little hard to get used to after using a larger phone, being able to comfortably use a phone with one hand again really is pretty nice. I can't speak to how it compares to other Sony phones, since this is the first one I've owned; after so long on stock Android, it took some getting used to, but installing the Google Keyboard helped a lot (I rely on the swipe-from-backspace to delete words/phrases quite a lot, and I never want to go back). The dedicated two-stage shutter button is nice, and does a good job of starting the camera without any fuss; though it wasn't quite as quick as I expected, it's still under a second.What I failed to notice (and still can't find on this product page) is that this is the international version. Which means the fingerprint sensor works (really well), it is compatible with more radio bands, and oh yeah- starts in Chinese, which makes all the ""Getting started"" prompts a nightmare to get through. This seller also was nice enough to include a ""travel adapter,"" since without it, you wouldn't be able to charge this phone in the U.S. I'm always hesitant to buy products on Amazon from third-party vendors, and these guys (NGP STORE USA) are a good example of why. If literally any of this had been in the description, I may have still purchased the phone. I certainly wouldn't have been so frustrated when I powered on the phone, and could've bought a separate OEM charger ahead of time.At least they shipped quickly.Bottom line is: decent phone, great camera, as small as advertised (for better or worse), working fingerprint sensor, great if you speak Chinese, buy a separate charger, or purchase from Amazon directly."
"391369","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - White (US Warranty)",5,"Excellent small footprint smart phone, just what I was looking for. Camera seems powerful once it's mastered. Ability to preserve battery power when not used is better than any previous phone I've had. The remaining question is durability."
"391370","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - White (US Warranty)",4,"It's a nice phone just wish it was smaller in a little more thinner. the os is way smoother and faster than my z5 compact but overall I like it ."
"391371","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - White (US Warranty)",2,"The X compact feels slower, is not waterproof, is thicker, has an inconvenient USB-C port, has a camera which seems equal or poorer (especially in low light), and generally is not an upgrade in any sense of the word. Two positives: the black/blue color is beautiful, and the screen may be slightly superior. Not enough: upgrades need to be superior, Sony!"
"391372","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - White (US Warranty)",3,"Is this phone 4G LTE. I have it activated by ATT and not able to get the 4G signal after several calls to their customer service."
"391373","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - White (US Warranty)",5,"This is one of the few flagship phones that still comes in a compact form factor, but with the smaller size you're not actually giving up much at all. It's also cheaper than a lot of other flagships to boot. Battery life on this is amazing, probably close to 8-9 hours of screen on time. If it doesn't get used much all day, then it'll easily have over 80% charge left at night. Reminds me of old Nokia phones in that regard: excellent battery life and power management.The build quality is really solid. The screen is mildly curved on the edges (but not nearly as much as many other curved screens), giving it that little bit extra of a 'fancy' feel. The white color is also really unique. Doesn't come with a lot of bloatware at all, it's quick, snappy, multitasks well, and the camera is pretty fine too.Overall, probably the single best option if you're looking for a compact flagship-level phone in 2016 (and likely well into 2017), and actually gives many full-sized flagship phones a run too."
"391374","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - White (US Warranty)",5,"This phone is very sleek and beautiful, it's fast and does everything it supposed to without lagging. It's a good phone for the price. However, it's a big annoying that Sony doesn't send out headphones with the phone, but that's alright. It comes with the faster charging wall plug, and I've noticed that the phone does charge way faster when it's connected to the plug. The speakers on this phone aren't the best, they're ok though. Not very loud, but they are clear sounding. The cameras are not that good in low light, but everything else about the phone is an A+."
"391375","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - White (US Warranty)",5,"Love it.It's a great sizeUI is fastBattery life is excellent (usually use 30-50%/day)Screen is very good, don't let the releativly low resolution be a deterent, it's quite good even looking at very small detail.The built-in Sony apps can be somewhat annoying and not all can be uninstalled, but just hide them in a folder and turn off notification and they dont bother you.My only concerns are more with Andriod than anything Sony did. The privacy controls are insuffient, too much reliancy on google and it's qutie a hassle to disable cloud based data sharing. (On the positive side you don't need any relationship with Sony to use everything, a Sony account and cloud services can be skipped on startup and settings).As others have noted, this is the US SKU. That means it's missing 2 features: 1 no fingerprint reader, and 2 no smart battery control. Most people know about the first one, but the lack of smart battery control is hidden in the manual. This means no ""learning your habits"" and charging a less than a max speed. Because of this I don't plugin my phone overnight because I don't want it to charge to 100% or do so at a rapid speed, both of which lessen your battery life in the long term."
"391376","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - White (US Warranty)",5,"Love it"
"391377","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - White (US Warranty)",5,"I recently purchased the White US version of the X Compact for $350 after a great two years with this phone’s grandfather the Z3C. After debating whether to purchase the X Compact, Galaxy S7, Google Pixel and Honor 8, I’m quite happy with my decision. There have been some extremely critical reviews of the device - discrediting it as no longer being the compact flagship, but for the niche market that enjoys small-form factor android phones, the device is top of class. This review will highlight some of the unique features that I’ve encountered as well as addressing some of the harsh criticisms I’ve seen in other reviews.Design:I’ve always been a fan of Sony’s clean and minimalist design language for its Xperia line and this phone is no exception. In a market where every phone seems to have a utilitarian brushed metal or flashy, shiny design, the white model of this phone is a refreshing change. The looped edges (which are very akin to the Lumia Windows Phones) and small size of the device offer the perfect dimensions for one handed operation without performing a balancing act with your fingers. The 2.5D curved glass that seamlessly loops into to back of the unit which offers a unique feeling I’ve never experienced. The phone also does a great job of catching the light in interesting ways and it's been the first phone I’ve used that has literally turned heads when walking down the street.Build:Many people have been really harsh on this phone for having a plastic rear. While it is true that it can be easily scratched, I think Sony has gracefully addressed one of the biggest complaints of their previous lines while keeping true to their design aesthetic. Let me explain: the two predecessors to this phone, the Z3C and Z5C both had glass panels on the rear of the phone. While elegant and more scratch resistant than plastic, the phones were prone to spontaneous cracking, even while in a case. Sony could have gone the route of using a metal back, but at the cost of poor reception or having a plastic chin (like the Xperia XZ), but it would go against their clean slab design language they’ve retained for the previous lines. As someone who has always used his phone with a case or a skin, having the plastic back is not a problem for me.Another pain-point with this phone has been the lack of waterproofing that the Xperia line has become iconic for. After seeing videos online of people verifying the waterproofing and testing for myself, I can confirm that this phone is in fact waterproof. I can’t make any claims for the actual ingress rating, but I’ve been able to use my phone in the shower everyday since purchasing the phone without problems. My theory is the Sony omitted waterproofing as a an on-paper feature for this phone because it new that labor costs of repairing warranty claims for the device would not be cost effective for the volume sold to the US and UK markets, where larger devices reign supreme. If that isn’t evidence enough, the X Compact in Asian markets have the waterproof rating where smaller phones are more popular and where Sony has more resources to make warranty claims.The final pain-point I’ve seen with this phone is the fact that the US version does not have a fingerprint scanner. It does indeed have a fingerprint scanner, but because of a patent conflict with Hewlett-Packard, Sony had to disable it for the US markets. If you’re willing to get your hands dirty with android development, you can actually download and install the signed, UK firmware of the phone to enable the fingerprint scanner. As a plus, since the firmware is official and signed by Sony, you will not lose your warranty if you conduct the procedure. And what a fingerprint scanner it is. The scanner is extremely accurate, placed in the perfect position and unlocks my phone before I even I can even pull it out of my pocket.As for the rest of the phone, the device has the signature dual front facing speakers that are a huge improvement from the Z3C speakers. They won’t wow anyone with their loudness, but they’re perfect having crisp clean audio for sharing media with friends. The camera button is always welcomed and has a tactile dual click to allow focus lock before capture when taking pictures. The volume controls, on the other hand are in an awkward place. Sony has a tendency to place the volume buttons close to the camera shutter for use as a zoom keys, but I’ve noticed that I more often than not pinch the screen to zoom in so I would love to see those keys moved to the upper-left side of the device.Display:This is hands down one of the most gorgeous displays I have ever used. I’ve held this phone up to a Google Pixel (which has an AMOLED screen) and this device can go toe-to-toe with the Pixel’s Brightness and Saturation despite having a LCD panel screen. It's absolutely incredible how beautiful the display is. The colors are juicy and watching movies on the device is. That being said,unfortunately because it is an LCD panel it cannot achieve the absolute blackness that an AMOLED screen can. For me, it’s not noticeable enough to bother me but I can see how that could be an issue for people coming from AMOLED devices.Many people have been hyper-critical of the fact that this phone uses a 720p display in 2016. A 720p display is perfect for a display this size. iPhones have had similar resolutions for years without any complaint. Here is a comparison with the current gen iPhone handsets:iPhone SE: 4.0inch Screen at 1136 x 640 (320 pixels per inch)X Compact: 4.6inch Screen at 1280 x 720 (319 pixels per inch)iPhone 7: 4.7inch Screen at 1334 x 750 (326 pixels per inch)Yes, you can get Android phones with 400+ pixels per inch, but why have a screen that is more demanding on performance and battery life if you can’t even discern the individuals with the naked eye? Sony has realized this and chose the optimum screen for the form factor.Performance:Many people have criticized the fact that this device uses a Snapdragon 650 Processor instead of an 820 like its big brother. I think Sony chose this processor for a couple reasons. The smaller resolution of the X Compact means that similar rendering performance can be achieved with a scaled back processor. The 650 is also more power efficient than its big brother, which allows it to achieve the ludicrous battery life that the Compact line is known for. Yes this phone might not have the same raw performance numbers as some of the other top of the line phones on the market, but I have yet to experience any hiccups in any applications I’ve tried. And at the end of the day, isn’t that what really matters?Photo-Quality:This is still one of the primary reasons why I buy Sony phones. Sony devices have one of the most powerful imaging devices for android - if you know how to dial in the settings. The 23 MP Camera allows for fidelity I’ve never been able to achieve in any phone I’ve tried. The camera app has all of the controls you’d expect from a DSLR, but in a compact size. One of the biggest improvements from the previous camera app is the ability to control shutter speed now. Also, compared to the Z3C, the automatic mode is much better at finding the right settings for the current scene. Handheld and low-light pictures are also much clearer thanks to the new laser auto-focus and improved capture speed. I can speak for the camera all day long, but I’ll just attach some pictures so you can see for yourself.Battery Life:This is the most battery efficient smart phone I’ve ever used. My usage habits typically involve using GPS and streaming music on my way to work, checking social media, news and dating apps throughout the day, photo taking in the afternoon and casting media in the evening. I would consider myself someone with heavy use with the exception of playing 3D games. I’ve been able to go from 8am to 10pm with over 40% battery left without any active battery saving features.I’ve always been a huge fan of Sony’s built in battery saving features. I’ve tested the device with Stamina Enabled for the full duration of the battery and a more normal usage pattern, and it is a breeze to get up to 3 full days of use. If you want to stretch it even further, you can turn on Ultra Stamina Mode which turns off all your apps sans the basic. With that mode enabled, my phone has predicted that it can go up to 2 weeks.Software:Sony’s build of android is almost entirely stock save a couple of power saving features and some bloatware. Sony’s own included apps have varying degrees of use. Sony makes one of the best Album apps I’ve used but things like LifeLog, Xperia Lounge and What’s New I could do without. As for the third party software, Sony actually includes some useful ones including Amazon Shopping and Swiftkey. Luckily if there is anything you don’t like, you can easily disable any apps you don’t like.Accessories:One of the biggest downfalls for the device is the accessory support. Two things I usually buy when I get a new phone are a tempered glass screen protector and a Ringke Fusion Case. Because of the negative reception to the phone and low volume, many of the common accessory manufacturers have elected to pass up this device in their production line up. In my attempts to find a screen protector, I’ve been unable to find any that have a complete adhesive hold to the entire screen; the screen protectors either omit the curved edges or screen protectors that only attach from adhesive on the edges, leaving a noticeable air gap between the screen and protector. Thus, I’ve had to resort to using Skinomi’s screen protector in the interim. Unfortunately Ringke does not have any plans to make their Fusion case for this device, but I was able to find the MicroP TPU case which achieves some similar design aesthetics as the Ringke cases.TLDR:Pros:- Beautiful design- Small form factor phone- Beautiful display- Fast fingerprint sensor- Unofficial but present waterproofing- Insane battery life- Great cameraCons:- Very little accessory support (Cases / screen protectors)- Activating fingerprint sensor requires some tinkering- Volume buttons in an awkward location for use with volumeVerdict:The Xperia X Compact is one of the best options if you’re looking for a small form factor phone with an excellent camera and battery life. This phone does have its fair share of nuances that make it less approachable than offerings by Samsung, Xiaomi and Google, but with a little work you can turn the device into an absolute pleasure to use."
"391378","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - White (US Warranty)",5,"I chose this phone because of it's smaller, more portable size, and it has worked perfectly so far. It has many new, up to date features with the same reliability as any other android. Shipping was fast and efficient, and the box comes with everything you need to get started. This is a great phone from a great company, and I would recommend it to anyone!"
"391379","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - White (US Warranty)",4,"This phone is great and simple to work. I bought it to replace my Japanese phone that the company wouldn't allow me to upgrade. The only issue with this cell phone is it is not Japan certified so mobile data does not work with it."
"391380","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - White (US Warranty)",5,"The Sony compact series has always been my go to for an Android phone because of the size and speed. The previous compacts were based on the latest and greatest highest end chip set at the time of their releases. When this phone was announced as having the SD 650, I was more than disappointed so I wrote the phone off. I wasn't sure which phone to get so I bought an iPhone 7 which lasted a couple weeks until I remembered how restricted ios was. I then had three options for a smallish phone. The Honor 8.. Still a little large, the Google pixel.. Expensive! and the Sony X compact. I had all three within about a month. I kept the X compact. Yep that's right. I gave up the greatest from Google and a very premium made Honor 8. The reason?Number 1-the feel and size are just right. Its just a joy to use and carry.Number 2- i immediately realized that this phone is just as fast as the z5 compact and I'm not sure what they did but this phone is silky smooth, almost iphone like. You have some hang ups like every other Android like in the play Store but overall I am really impressed with the performance. That just shows that specs are not everything and there is something to be said for real optimization.Number - 3 price. It was dropped to $399 when I bought mine. Compared to the pixel, it's half the price.I'm no Camara guru so I can't really speak on this too much but it does take some real nice shots in good light. Low light will not be the best.Many people are bashing because the phone isn't waterproof but it doesn't bother me.*edit. It's frustrating when someone gives one star and is not even talking about this phone!! The X compact does NOT have a cover for the USB!!!! This proves that the reviewer is ignorant. Amazon needs to monitor these reviews better!!"
"391381","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - White (US Warranty)",4,"This is by no means a perfect phone but this is really the best you can get for a small android phone. Almost all the phone manufacturers have dismissed making a small phone in favor of their 5+ inch slabs. I started using androids with a Moto X 2013, which to me was the perfect 4.7 inch phone if you disregard the crappy camera that it had. Unfortunately, Motorola decided bigger is better with their later models, and now the their Chinese overlords that currently own them have pretty much stated that they have no plans of making a small phone again. In fact, they have gone full retard with them making their current phones even bigger and wider.After the Moto X started slowing down after a few drops and age, I ""upgraded"" to the new Moto G 2015, which was not too bad in terms of screen height at 5 inches, but the width of this tubby made it hard to handle with one hand. Not to mention that is was a downgrade from the beautiful AMOLED screen from the Moto X. My camera and LED light crapped out after I dropped my Moto G so I got the Xperia X Compact after some research.Now the nice things about this phone:- Screen: I'm not much of a high res snob but 720p works for this size and it looks much better than my Moto G which had that resolution for 5 inches. Just wish this was an AMOLED for those nice dark blacks.- Memory: I've felt no slowdowns as far as RAM when multitasking. For regular storage you have 32GB which is enough for most people but you can also expand it 256 GB more with a micro SD.- Camera: Best camera that I've had which is not saying much given what my previous phones are. Other people would probably be more credible than me since I never but too much importance on this function but these pictures do look sweet.- Speed: Feels a hell of a lot snappier than my previous phone which is really no surprise with the superior processor. Apparently, the lower resolution gives it a faster speed than say a 1080p would.- Button placement: Yes, I actually like where the sound buttons are placed. I use my phones left handed (even though I'm right handed) and the button placement for volume is actually not awkward as it would be for a right handed user. This doubles as a convenient zoom in and out button for the camera.- Double front facing speakers: A rarity these days, especially for this phone size. Very high quality audio too.-Battery life: About 40-60% at the end of a day which is pretty good for me but this will depend on the person and what apps they are using.Not so great things:- Exterior design: Could have used a more matte, less slippery design. Shows fingerprints. All this can be fixed with a skin but this should not have been necessary. Ergonomics are inferior to the curved Motorola and Samsung designs for handling, while this did improve from the previous blocky Sony phones by curving the sides, they could have done better.Price: This isn't too bad now that Sony has put down the crack pipe and lowered the price from their initial 500 dollar tag.Neutral things:- Lack of fingerprint scanner: This can actually be enabled by reflashing to the UK version which is what I did. Does appear to show less bars on reception as mentioned by a previous reviewer but the connection seems to work just fine. Would not recommend doing this for everyone but do it at your own risk or just buy the international version.-No waterproofing: More accurately, this is not warrantied as being waterproof. YouTube videos have shown that this is actually pretty water resistant and that Sony most likely just doesn't want to cover claims.Say what you will about Sony, while they are deserving of much criticism for their reported crappy customer service and overpricing of their phones, they are the only ones in the android market that are meeting a neglected segment by making a decent phone that is easy to handle one handed, that has a near stock android feel, and actually has the back and recent keys on the correct sides (looking at you Samsung).Note: Still in early ownership and will update if there are any snags."
"391382","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - White (US Warranty)",5,"I wanted a smaller phone than my last one (One Plus). This one is the perfect size for me. Small enough to fit in my pocket, but not so small you can't do anything on it. I really like the light blue color. So far, I have no complaints (I've had it for about a month). It takes great pictures too! I am very happy with my purchase."
"391383","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - White (US Warranty)",5,"I realy so happy. It is so fast and nice phone. I used iphone 7 plus but it so big .the best compact phone . I love X compact."
"391384","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - White (US Warranty)",5,"Sony gets a lot of flak for this phone using the 650 chipset but honestly I am glad they did. There are no heat issues and the phone is blazing fast. Being a compact the phone feels great in the hand and there is no more ""hand shimmy"" needed to get to everything on the screen. Not to mention that it doesn't take up all of your pocket real estate if you like keeping your phone in the front. Needless to say the battery life is also amazing. This will get you through all day usage and then some even if you watch a movie or two on netflix. If your looking for a solid one hander with great performance and long battery life this is it."
"391385","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - White (US Warranty)",3,"I have problems with the phone. Only work for one day and I called Sony to help me but they could not. So at this point I need to return the phone"
"391386","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - White (US Warranty)",5,"I have a small palm and short fingers, it fits perfectly. Feels very solid and looks very pleasing. Love the UI experience."
"391387","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - White (US Warranty)",4,"Since most others have already reviewed the major specs, I'll just touch on the two features that I was the most curious about but no one else seemed to review.Camera speed: So I'm a pet parent, and as every pet parent knows, shutter speed is extremely important when it comes to catching that oh-so-cute face your pup or kitty (I have both) are making at you before they ruin it with a yawn or getting distracted by a squirrel. My last phone (Galaxy SIII) was super quick at taking photos, even if they were blurred from the motion. I decided against the Xperia Z5 compact because of all the reviews on the slow camera speed. The X Compact appears to load the camera much quicker than what I saw in videos for the Z5 Compact, especially if you load by double clicking the power button. (it's a slower load via the dedicated camera button.) The shutter speed, however, is quicker than my husband's Xperia Z3 flagship, but still slower than my Galaxy S III. Even so, the auto focus does act pretty quickly, and it seems quicker the better the lighting is. The picture quality is pretty good, though, except that the colors are on the bluish side in dim lighting.Speakerphone quality: How is it 2016 and speakerphone quality is worse than before?! Maybe it's a Sony problem. Husband's Z3 is barely audible on speakerphone, and the X Compact made only slight improvement. It's audible when it's dead quiet around you, but less so when I'm walking the dog outside, and near impossible when I'm in the car. What's the big deal about these front facing speakers if I can't hear the other person very well?! (note: speakers seem to be great for playing videos and games.)Phone still gets 4 stars because of all the other nice features everyone else had already reviewed. But wanted to share about those two points since they are not often talked about."
"391388","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - White (US Warranty)",5,"Sexy, sexy phone! Camera needs some patience, but end results are wonderful!"
"391389","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - White (US Warranty)",4,"If you are looking for a mid sized phone you can use with one hand in October of 2016 this phone is your best option.Pros:- Phone fits in one hand- Battery life lasts all day and in some cases two days- Phone works great on T-mobile's network while also having band 12 for faster LTE (Works well on AT&T too)- UI is smooth and doesn't lag with a minimalist skin over stock android- No overheating issues like z5 compact- Android 7.0 N due to release in November- USB C with quick charge 3.0- Expandable memory- Front facing speakersCons- Plastic doesn't feel as premium like the s7 and iphone 7- Fairly thick for a phone made in 2016- Camera is adequate but has trouble in low light and tends to overexpose in daylight- No amoled display- Volume buttons are too low although they function well when using the camera- No fingerprint sensor with US version- No waterproofing- Black is more of a dark blueIt's unfortunate that the market is saturated with so many phablets and we have very little choice when it comes to conservatively sized devices but all in all I think this is a good phone that you won't regret buying if you are wanting a moderately sized phone"
"391390","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - White (US Warranty)",3,"I got it in ""Midnight Black"" They should have called it Navy Blue!? Why Sony? It bugs me, because it really is blue. I own both Xperia Z3 and Z5 and I think I'll send the XC back. It's very nice, comfortable to hold and the buttons are a little more out of the way. But the processor is faster on the Z5 and the rest of the specs aren't hugely different. If it was only truly black I'd probably keep it although there is a lot of plastic on it."
"391391","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - White (US Warranty)",3,"This phone is basically the same as Sony Xperia Z5 Compact. Only upside: 1GB more ram. Downsides: not waterproof, slower processor, USB-C instead of standard Micro-USB, more expensive.At this price point Z5 Compact international model (that has fingerprint scanner) feels like a much better purchase."
"391392","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - White (US Warranty)",5,"Starting off, I'm coming from a Nexus 5 (2013) and I primarily got this phone because the Nexus was getting a bit long in the tooth, so this is a big jump for me in terms of phones and I think it's great overall. I chose the X Compact (over, let's say, the new Moto phones or the Pixel phones about to come out) primarily due to its smaller size as well as its design (though the X Compact was definitely in the upper limit of what I was willing to pay for a new phone); I rather enjoy the simple, clean design of it with the curves along the long edges. Looking at just the specs, it does seem overpriced (I got this at a pretty nice deal, though), but I ultimately enjoy the purchase.My pros and cons are coming from a user that doesn't play games, nor watch too many videos or listen to music too much. I just use it for chatting with friends and communicating with co workers (e.g. text, e-mail, etc), and browsing everyone's favorite news aggregator. Sprinkle in some photo taking, reading the news, and that's pretty much all I use my smartphone for, so my expectations are set accordingly.Pros:+ Clean, simple design with a nice color+ Nice pocketable size+ 720p screen looks great+ Speedy performance for what I need/want+ Dual front facing speakers+ Camera seems nice (I haven't tested it too rigorously yet, however)+ Good battery life (easily lasts me a day with 40% left, but again, I'm not a heavy user)+ Fast charging, and USB C is nice (though I guess I have to get an adapter for all my micro USB chargers)+ Great, lightly skinned Android with 7.0 Nougat updates confirmed (albeit sometime in November, I think?)I can't think of too many cons since I'm not exactly the pickiest, and I'm still in the honeymoon stage with this phone.Cons:- Bit expensive for the hardware you get compared to other phones- Some bloatware that can't be uninstalled, but you can hide them from your apps drawer- Speakers aren't the loudest- Not too many accessories out yet (e.g. cases, screen protectors)Again, I really like this phone, but if you're looking for a phone with top of the line specs or something of comparable specs to this one at a lower price point, you may want to look elsewhere (e.g. OnePlus 3, Moto G4 family, Nexus 5X/6P, etc). I'll try to update this in a month or two, however, when I can probably be a bit more discerning. Hope this helps!"
"391393","Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - White (US Warranty)",4,"I use this phone for few hours and found how fast the battery dies after my iPhone SE.

"391472","Sony Xperia X Performance unlocked smartphone,32GB White (US Warranty)",1,"15 minutes only 6% battery's life"
"391473","Sony Xperia X Performance unlocked smartphone,32GB White (US Warranty)",2,"Compared to a Xperia z3 plus which I have as a backup, it is interesting how this phone (xperia x performance) does not represent much improvement.1) Battery life is no better or even slightly worse than the z3 plus. In other words, battery life is on the bad end of the scale. You will only get 2 day battery life if you barely use the phone. And I am an experienced Android user, so I know how to disable apps, use Marshmallow, etc. etc. Believe me (as Donald Trump says) the battery life on this phone is BAD.2) Display is no better than on the z3 plus. The x performance is much brighter and may be slightly sharper, but at equivalent brightness levels, there is no real difference (the z3 plus has to be turned up higher on the slider to match the brightness of the x performance).HOWEVER, the z3 plus is a 5.2 inch screen whereas the x performance is a 5 inch screen, so in this regard the z3 plus is better. You would think you'd pay a penalty in phone size, but actually the z3 plus is only slightly larger (hxw and this is hardly noticeable) and is actually lighter weight and thinner. Plus the white balance of the x performance had to be adjusted (RGB in the settings).3. Speed. Yes the x performance is perhaps subjectively 10 percent faster but no more. The heating issues of the z3 plus are largely solved and both phones heat up when the camera is used. Perhaps the z3 plus heats up a more, but both have heating issues when using the camera.I can only imagine that the standard xperia x is not even as fast as the z3 plus4. Camera. Both are 20 mp cameras, but the x performance camera has more options and somewhat better image quality.5. Speakers. Here the x performance has much better audio because of the front facing speakers. Voices are especially coherent, with good high frequency reproduction. Vast advantage to the x performance.4. Construction. I never had a problem with all glass construction and the plastic side panels and aluminum back of the x, at least to me, do not represent an improvement.I should have listened to the professional reviews and not bought this phone. I should not have thrown away the box or else I would return it. It is not a bad phone obviously, but is hardly an improvement over a Sony phone which is 2-3 generations old."
"391474","Sony Xperia X Performance unlocked smartphone,32GB White (US Warranty)",1,"Posting from one this very moment... This thing is as crappy as a high end device could possibly be. Within 2 days of receiving it, it already shows signs of tear and wear. 2 days!!!Slow startup. Takes about 30s to fully boot up.Now this is the 2nd android device I have tried, and I still dont get the fusss. The aesthetics is basic, performance is just ok. Maybe I am biased coming from flagship Nokia devices (my latest being the Lumia 930) Any way this nonsense is getting into a box on its way back to amazon."

"391487","Sony Xperia X unlocked smartphone,32GB Black (US Warranty)",1,"I've order this phone because my Xperia Z1 Compact (that I really liked) suddenly died - stopped working after 1 year and 8 months without any reason. I liked my Z1 and don't have any complaints other than that it died so quickly. I decided to try something a little bigger and newer. I choose Xperia X because the camera promised to be great and overall performance. However, it turned out to be very disappointing. The quality of pictures are very poor. The images are not sharp, instead they're quite blurry regardless of the settings. In addition, the phone battery life is terrible, I used it for a short time to test pictures and video - battery went from 100% to 30% and the phone overheated. On another day, I used it very lightly - only checked emails few times and took few pictures - the phone battery went from 100% down to 20% by evening (I didn't add any apps and didn't run any games). I also need to mentioned that color is not truly pink as shown on the internet. It actually a very light copper color, more like a new penny color - not pink at all. I am returning this phone back and will look for something that provides better quality pictures and has a longer battery life.I ordered a new phone, but the package arrived as if it had been opened and used before. It's possible that I was sent a used, defective phone, despite me paying for a new phone.Please post if you've experienced similar issues with your phone."

"391489","Sony Xperia X unlocked smartphone,32GB Black (US Warranty)",4,"I have been in the market for a phone for awhile, and I didn't want just any other popular phone. I researched and found that the Sony Xperia has one of the best cell phone cameras out there and it uses the Android system. Not only that, it allows you to customize the functions on the phone such as the white balance of the home screen. I love it. The only Cons are the terrible battery life and the phone didn't come with headphones. Other than that, I'm happy with my purchase."
"391490","Sony Xperia X unlocked smartphone,32GB Black (US Warranty)",3,"Awesome phone, but the phone I received has a round, plastic tab on the front with the letters NFC.

"391492","Sony Xperia X unlocked smartphone,32GB Black (US Warranty)",4,"I previously owned an Xperia z1. I loved the phone, but needed an upgrade.So far, the only issue I've had with this in the first week of use has been overheating whilst charging and using camera at the same time. 😬I hope it's not a preview of future performance, as the z1 only started acting up after it had been accidently dropped on numerous occasions. Headphones, interestingly, we're not included. Love the ease of the interface, and excellent camera quality. Miss the glass backing."

"391495","Sony Xperia X unlocked smartphone,32GB Black (US Warranty)",1,"It is very poor battery life for this fantasy new sony cellphone. It lost 50% battery life overnight as idle time. And very easy lost 70% battery life during 5 hours. I had to disable most Apps, and now the battery life is little bit better. BUT, can we still call it a smart phone without any Apps in order to save the battery life?"
"391496","Sony Xperia X unlocked smartphone,32GB Black (US Warranty)",5,"Having tried almost every recent Sony Xperia phone in the past 3 years or so, this is by far one of the best since the Xperia Z3 Compact. It's faster than the Z5 series (Antutu and everyday usage). Snappy, no lag, camera is soon much quicker and better photos. And unless you really want the water proofing or care for benchmarks, no reason to get the thicker and bulkier X Performance variant. I don't do games on the phone so the processor is more than enough and feels just as fast as any other phone in daily usage.The screen and design puts it on the same level as other flagships. Curved and flush with the bezels, smooth and feels premium. I have an iPhone 6S as well and I finally feel the Sony has that same polished and feel when you hold it in your hand. Price could be a little cheaper but Sony is always a little pricier than others. Size is a perfect balance I think between bulky 5.5+ phones and smaller 4.x phones."
"391497","Sony Xperia X unlocked smartphone,32GB Black (US Warranty)",1,"My first review ever. This is a very good looking item. However, camera overheats so fast that it is worthless. 3 min video and a few pictures is all you get before you get the notification that the camera is overheating."

Rounded edges is a big plus.Performance is solid and free of lagging. 32GB storage is okay, but you get much less of free space. 3GB of RAM is good.Fingerprint sensor is a very useful thing. However, you will have to install a firmware from another region to enable it (do it on your own fear and risk! I do not recommend you to do this). They locked the sensor in US version as you may already know.What else to say? Camera is okay. I was not able to test it a lot, as I don't care that much about camera, but it's definitely nice to have 13mp frontal camera. Flash light of the rear camera is stronger that was on Z2. I use bank app to deposit checks and it's hard to take a good picture of check when you don't have enough light around. Flash is strong and it makes checks too light and hard to read.Reception is good. Nice to finally have band 12, it really helps with T-Mobile. Wi-Fi connection is solid and didn't give me any headaches.Battery could have been better. Have to charge everyday. Might be something with Android Marshmallow?

"391651","Sony Xperia X unlocked smartphone,32GB White (US Warranty)",1,"Receipt of goods and the purchase is not in conformity with the receipt of the z3+ and I bought the SONY X, not how to break the promise and has been the second time! After sale is not to deal with me very disappointed"
"391652","Sony Xperia X unlocked smartphone,32GB White (US Warranty)",3,"I bought this to replace an older smaller Sony Xperia Z3 Compact. While the screen was better, the camera, which is why I bought it, was no different. Even at a supposedly 23MP. I have no idea why Sony can't make a good camera for their phones. They used to be the best when it comes to electronics, but I guess not any more. No fingerprint scanner like others have mentioned. Very disappointed. My small Xperia Z3 will be my last Sony phone. Their new phones are way over priced for what you get. The new Google Pixel may be my next choice depending on it's reviews."

"391655","Sony Xperia X unlocked smartphone,32GB White (US Warranty)",4,"Using it on T-mobile. No issues. Battery life is very decent. The phone comes with GPS/NFC on by default. Please turn them off and battery life will improve. Phone will perform some system updates upon startup - pls let it do so. Build is very high quality. I dont understand when users say there is nothing new in this phone.. It makes calls, it has a very good camera, runs all the apps...best of all has a form-factor that is fits human hands (one of the key reason I bought it). I got it just a few days ago..very satisfied so far..Update: WiFi reception is less robust than my prior Samsung phone. This issue appears to be more pronounced when both Bluetooth and WiFi are ON at the same time."
"391656","Sony Xperia X unlocked smartphone,32GB White (US Warranty)",4,"This is my second Sony. I had some problems with my x3 but figured I could have been the phone and decided to give Sony another shot. Mainly because of its camera. However I am sensing Samsung is beating song's butt. They are making it waterproof (which Sony is not doing anymore and why I got my z3) also, it snaps pictures in the dark! . I have a feeling a Samsung will be my next phone if this trend continues. Also there are no accessories widely available."
"391666","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB Black (US Warranty)",3,"The phone came in quick,the only problem I really found was the flap wont close I figure it was damaged during processing but nothing too serious, butis easily opened if I forget about it I will be posting pictures of the damaged side although it is a beautiful phone.And I may buy another one if this one gives out due to the flap"

"391670","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB Black (US Warranty)",4,"A great upgrade from the mobile phone I had 5 years ago. Some great features and some features are missing. Very challenging to find the block a caller. Just can see choice to go straight to voice mail. Would like more functions like text message editing, can only add change background. Adding contacts from messaging is strange, but can be done fine. Alarms are great because I can have as many as I want. All in all its a decent mobile where I can add more storage. The cost was also decent and the battery lasts me about two days.Pleased I bought it."
"391671","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB Black (US Warranty)",1,"I bought a Sony Xperia XA Ultra on Amazon, new with a US warranty, and I am having so many problems with it.1. I have a 10-30 second delay when initiating a call (dialing out) before it connects, even with full signal in a major city.2. There is no WiFi calling with T-Mobile, which is a big issue especially as someone who works in a hospital where there is no signal due to all the interference from the walls, MRI's and CT scanners, but WiFi is everywhere. It seems most people buying this phone seem to be using it on T-Mobile in the United States and that is a critical feature that most other phones have, including unlocked OEM phones from other companies. Surprised it's not even an option to enable like other competitors (One Plus 3, ALL Samsung devices, Apple iPhones, etc).3. The screen brightness isn't auto adjusting properly even with the setting for adaptive brightness being on.4. Having the volume rocker on the right next to the power button AND the camera button is silly. They are inadvertantly hit.5. The Mediatek CPU is kinda slow and the Wifi module onboard is significantly slower than a Qualcomm chipet.6. No fingerprint scannerFirmware is up to date with the latest software as of 10/22/2016:BUILD: 36.0.A.2.109Model F32131/5 star rating until Sony fixes the MANY MAJOR issues.UPDATE: Sony released a firmware update, and I have updated above the latest firmware for this handset. The phone STILL has ALL of the issues above, AND now has worse battery life. This phone is really a piece of crap. The only thing making me keep it is how cheap it is for the size of the screen.UPDATE 2: Sony Customer support is absolutely TERRIBLE. I have tried communicating with them in numerous ways and multiple attempts, and they have no clue how to go off script to help. Their solution is sto send in my unit (I've gone through a few replacements at this point, so it's not the ""unit"", it's piss poor engineering and software support.UPDATE 3: The phone is noticiably slower and gettigng very sluggish with only 3 weeks of use so far. Unbelievable."
"391672","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB Black (US Warranty)",3,"Bad vibration"
"391673","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB Black (US Warranty)",5,"Okay! I have to say that I love this phone it's just the cat's meow nice big screen lots of great features inmates calls with no problem. There's a lot of reviews that are pre software update about LTE problems which have been addressed they've upgraded the software so the battery last longer. I don't get me wrong it's still not the longest lasting battery but you get about what you get with your other phones like the Samsung Galaxy and many of the other phones. Huawei has this hands down as does Apple from what I understand. Not much I can say bad about this phone few times the speaker has locked up on me and is not heard me when I was answering calls for asking Google a question. I rebooted a couple times and it's fine. It may turn out to be a problem although after the reboot it's been fine as I said. For the price I don't know that you can do much better it's a really good phone."
"391674","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB Black (US Warranty)",5,"I would give this a 10 star rating people be sleeping on this phone right here I bought it because of the camera and screen size. Yes I understand it's Apple & Samsung taking the market but this is way cheaper than both the iPhone and Galaxy's, and does a lot more too. Wake up people, this phone legit and unlocked too. Yes it works with T-mobile and at&t. Like what Donald Trump says, WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO LOSE?"
"391675","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB Black (US Warranty)",5,"Got for my granddaughter - apparently we did not pay enough attention to weight and dimensions. This phone is very large. She decided to give it a try and then she liked it. She especially likes the camera - when we saw the size we ordered a case because we were concerned about protecting it."
"391676","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB Black (US Warranty)",1,"Iphone 5s is way better than this"
"391677","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB Black (US Warranty)",5,"I had the Z3 and The Z Ultra. Both of those phones were flagship devices when they came out, so I thought that buying a midranger might not give me a great experience. so far i love the phone. It has band 12 for T-mobile, but no Volte, but data still works. The camera is decent in low light and great in bright daylight. The phone is not too big to hold like my Z Ultra, and has the ability to have one handed operation. The display is crisp, and 1080 p is plenty for the screens size. i have seen some trouble syncing with my chromecast to screen mirror, but that may be because there is a built in function on the xa ultra that you can sync without having the app. Sound quality is great, and the speaker is decenltly loud. I havent seen the phone be sluggish or slow, and i have about 50 apps on my phone. The white does not get dirty as some have stated. The back feels kind of glossy and it is not like my Z4 tablet, which gets very dirty. The edge to edge display is awesome and playing games and watching videos is a delight. Even N.O.V.A. 3 Ran just fine, so it should be able to play relatively every smartphone game with ease. I love this phone. I don't know what else to say."
"391678","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB Black (US Warranty)",4,"Yes, this phone is very slick. I like the appearance of this phone a lot, but not so much the inside. No native Video Calls or Notes (very important). The camera wise is alright. I compared it with my old iPhone 5 and I think the iPhone won though. Photography is one of my hobbies and this phone is definitely not for me. I'm returning it. Too much limitations."
"391679","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB Black (US Warranty)",1,"I have used this phone now for a couple of days and I think for the amount of money I paid it is a huge disappointment. Before I purchased it I was debating if the battery life is good enough or if it could be a issue. Now the battery life is the least of my concern.First off all the phone box itself was not sealed. So there is no proof that the phone is really a new phone.The WIFI issue: Whenever the WIFI area changes the phone does not connect automatically. It starts scanning for available WIFI and scans and scans... It keeps saying ""No WIFI available"" even if I stand directly next to the WIFI Router. After 30 min I usually give up and I reboot the phone. Like I said so far the phone was never able to connect automatically to a different WIFI so I always end up restarting the phone.The Transfer issue: If the phone is connected to the computer to transfer pictures, music, etc. a couple of problems may acure:-The computer is not always able to find the device-If finally connected it does not always display all folders-Sometimes if you open a folder it says Folder empty when it is not-Very often after a couple of minutes connected to the computer a message pops up saying: The device is not working anymore or it is disconnected, which is not true-Most of the time while transferring pictures to the computer it freezes. So I have constantly plug and unplug the device to the computer.Besides the major issues there are some minor issues like:-you can not change the Font-just certain things ( music, pictures, videos) are able to transfer to the sd card-you can not wake up the screen by touching it-no headphones came with the purchase of the phoneProbably there are even more major and minor issues I have not discovered so far, I would definitely not recommend this phone to anyone."

"391683","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB Black (US Warranty)",3,"I want badly to give this phone a better review. However, after using the Z1 and then the Z2, this phone is a bit of a let down. Sony decided to use a less expensive processor, resulting in a much lower priced phone. This is the great news and the processor seems to be very effective. The bad news is that Sony, for some reason changed some of the things, which made me rave about their phones in the past. The first thing they changed is there is no longer a magnetic charging option. Also, the USB port is not covered making this phone non-waterproof. Without the magnetic charging port, the USB port has to be used. If Sony had made this phone wireless charging compatible, the removal of the magnetic port would not be an issue. Why are so many phones wireless charging capable, but Sony cannot get onboard with this? The fact that it is rapid charging capable is a plus however, I had to purchase a rapid charger separately. Sony also removed the capability to connect to a TV via HDMI/MHL. The only way to connect and play media on a TV is via wireless means (DNLA, Bluetooth). Therefore, if the TV is not up-to-date with those technologies, you are out of luck. Bad move Sony, bad move!! The camera so far does seem to have been upgraded. I was never impressed with the camera on both my Z1 or Z2. What I am curious is if I will still have to use my Microphone STM10 at concerts in order for the sound to not be garbled?"
"391684","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB Black (US Warranty)",3,"No Wifi CallingOther than that looks good feels good wish it was more popular for more cases and more support from online forums."

"391687","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB Black (US Warranty)",5,"excellent"
"391688","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB Black (US Warranty)",4,"The good:The phone is a huge improvement over my 3 year old HTC One M8.It does everything I need a phone for, including actually making calls.I've had no connectivity or battery issues, it came up instantly on the AT&T network, and I've been impressed with the screen and overall responsiveness.The not so good:This phone has hit the floor more often in the week that I've owned it than all of my other phones combined.There are several contributing factors, including the size, the almost frictionless back, and the tendency to get buried under various objects on my desk while connected to headphones, leading me to forget about and fling it off into space when moving.The last drop was catastrophic- directly face down onto a bathroom tile floor, and the front glass shattered.This is the first time I've ever damaged a phone in such a fashion, and it was a mildly traumatic experience.Yes, first world problems, I know.The irony of the situation is that the protective case I ordered for the phone arrives today.Unfortunately, the glass and the touch screen are integral to one another, and I was quoted a price of over 200 dollars to repair.Bummer.Hence the title of this review- seriously, don't start using this phone without a case unless you live in a completely carpeted world, or never, ever take your phone into a room with hard tile floors, or probably, even outside."

I'm still trying to figure out how to work everything out.But it is beautiful, maybe a little too big for me but I'm truly satisfied. The camera is pretty okay as well"
"391691","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB Black (US Warranty)",3,"Before I decided to buy this phone, numerous reviews and researches had been done. Then this phone became my final choice.This is a decent phone. There are quite a few concerns online over the battery, screen resolution, and the main camera's lack of optical image stabilizer.Well, I'd like to say that after having this phone for couple of days, the only thing I don't find entirely satisfying is the main camera. Although it comes with 21.5 mega pixels, the quality of the photos really isn't any better than the main camera on the LG G3, which has 13 mega pixels.The 1920x1080p screen is great, and sometime can be rather too bright, but such problem can be taken care of by dialing the brightness down several notches.Battery wise, when it's fully charged, two 120mins movies on Netflix, 20 plus photographs taken with flash, on and off web browsing, numerous text messages exchange on two messengers, all done in the time span of 7 hours, can be sustained by the battery with still 8% left.It also doesn't take more than two hours to fully charge the battery, despite some reviews online. I have noticed that it has taken about a minute to charge a little more than 1% of the power. From 3% to 100%, the battery on my phone took about 93 minutes.Another thing is that I have watched a review on You Tube about somebody claiming that this phone doesn't allow apps to be saved on the additional memory card. Well, I have no problem transfer most of my apps on to the SD card, so just for the reference.Anyway, for a mid-range phone at this price, it is not bad."
"391692","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB Black (US Warranty)",5,"Excellent product. Very good seller."
"391693","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB Black (US Warranty)",5,"Perfect phone for me! I love the size which is basically what I need. Plus the screen which is edge-to-edge makes it easier for the eyes ( especially after long hours of reading!) It has a smooth user interface. The pictures are awesome. In terms of price and quality, with the qualities this phone has to offer the price is indeed very reasonable!"
"391694","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB Black (US Warranty)",1,"Please avoid this phone and any phone by SONY at all cost.I really try to avoid posting negative reviews on here and instead try to reach the manufacturer customer support first. What I experienced, I do not think no customer would want to go through. Just to provide a backstory, I have had Sony Z5 premium which died on October 31st suddenly. I called Sony customer care who stated there is nothing they could do. Also, it would take MORE than a month to get your device back (there is no loaner and you pay return shipping on your dime). Since I liked the clean design of SONY, I thought I would buy something I am used to and was cheap. This phone was on sale for $299 and with 6 inch display, I thought it was perfect. It is far less than perfect and I have hated every second of it. Here are the problems that I have encountered:- The screen becomes non responsive at times. You would click and it would be like Windows 98 trying to figure how to reload on like BBC News app. I think the processor they put on is poor for 2016 and future use. If that is not annoying, what really bugged me is the display screen would do ghosting. By ghosting, the screen will be frozen but you could see there some thing, like a ghost, is touching the screen. Since the screen is curved, I think the pressure makes the screen act out. The ghost touches happen on all four corners.- When you are calling someone, the call would not go through. You would see the caller dialing but it will stay static. The resolution is to drop the call and try again. God have mercy when you call through your car's bluetooth or put it on the speaker - you cannot hear the dail going out and you would not hear the person when he will pick up. You have to hang up and call again.- 16 GB's is a joke. Seriously. Because with the updates that SONY released after the phone was launched, it is actually like 10 Gb's or less. This will fill up your phone fast. I am on 7 Gb's and the phone feels like it is on its last legs with the performance. Be warned.Now the good news - Even the person won't be able to hear you, the network signal and the SAR rating on this phone is good! Where I cannot usually get a signal or a poor signal with my previous phone, this phone gets it. (T-Mobile network). The battery life is also good, which is useful for staring at the phone after it takes forever to work."
"391695","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB Black (US Warranty)",5,"WOW!! First of all, bought used through Amazon Prime and I was shocked when I opened it. It looked like it was new. . Not a scratch, in original box, look like factory wrapping. . The phone itself works well, very big screen and quite fast for everyday use, (It is not a Samsung S7 fast). The only drawback is the internal memory (16 gig) but I put in aa external memory card and used APP2SD app to move some apps to it. Great phone for the Money, very happy with it and Amazon."
"391696","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB Black (US Warranty)",5,"I'm a cell phone addict, I have played with a number of devices ranging from the Oneplus 2, Galaxy S7, and Nexus 6P over the past year. I have to say for 298 with the 64gb sd card, this was a steal. The build quality of the device is fantastic, it has NFC, and a 1080P display. The battery while not large seems to work just fine, and Stamina mode can help extend the life even further.I'm averaging about 5.5 to 6 hours of screen on time which for a 2700 mah battery, 6"" display, and octacore processor is fantastic. Signal seems to be strong, and reliable, call quality is good and bluetooth works great. The cameras are solid as well I've been snapping pics of my dog. Performance is solid, while it is in fact a Mediatek P10 processor it is more than capable of handling day to day tasks and basic gaming. The screen is responsive, and clear, with good viewing angles, and is an AMOLED panel.The build quality of the phone is top notch, it feels great and balanced in your hand, and while extremely large is a smaller footprint than an iPhone 6s Plus or original Nexus 6 thanks to the bezeless sides.Only thing I wish this had is a fingerprint reader, and a tap to wake feature so I didn't always need to use the power button. Other than that I love my new device!"
"391697","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB Black (US Warranty)",5,"Great 6 inch device for the money! Got to hand it to Sony for making an excellent mid-range smartphone. This XA Ultra screams quality with it's camera, screen, and those side bezels are sexy af. Battery life hasn't been much of an issue.Favorite out of the entire Xperia lineup."
"391698","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB Black (US Warranty)",5,"I love this phone so much. It's not a high end powerhouse but the cpu is more than capable at running every day apps.The display looks amazing and the edge to edge design is just plain sexy. The camera does a pretty decent job as well. I got the phone plus a 64 GB card for a grand total of $294 plus it shipped fairly quickly. That's a deal you can't beat and I hope Sony continues to do deals with future handsets."

"391700","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB Black (US Warranty)",4,"This is a review comparing this phone to the HTC Desire Eye, on Android 6.0 Marshmallow.I got this phone with the Sony MicroSD 64GB deal for $306 ish after tax & free one-day shipping. Amazon told me I'd get it by the 15th, but it literally came next day, so hands off to you, Amazon.Screen : yes, it is extremely bigger than the HTC, by a whole .8 inches; the keyboard felt so much better on the Xperia XA Ultra, but that's just because my fingers had the space to press the right key. BUT quality wise, I was not impressed when I had my HTC right next to the Xperia. Fooled me, my HTC had a brighter and more clear colorful screen, even with the stock Xperia wallpaper applied.Camera : Oh boy, I was sad the minute it was opened. Colors were washed out in normal sunlit rooms, no way to save preferred options on top of the Superior Auto, and biggest difference between the HTC stock camera was the selfie front camera had no way to beautify in-app. I would have to download a separate app ): Nor was the front camera even clear; the focus on my HTC was superior. This was the deal breaker for me.Speed : Camera shutter speed was the same, camera start up speed was the same, picture processing after capture is slower on xperia, opening apps on the same wifi network was the same, opening apps on data plan was same, download speeds the same wifi and data wise, start up from power down was slower on the Xperia.Interface : Though I am used to HTC Sense Home layout, the Sony UI was not hard to navigate through, I found everything I needed quick or with some fast reading. I mean, the Sony one stuck with the notification drop down menu from vanilla Android, which was a nice difference to look at. But HTC could fit and has more options for the settings in the drop down, such as an extra row at the bottom for 12 options rather than just 9. You'd think you can fit more on a bigger screen, but Sony just didn't program it to utilize it that way. Shrugs.Two software updates straight out of the box, though the first was a quick update, but the second took a little longer to boot.Is okay, slight overheat in first start up and set up, but that's normal for any phone. But my concern is that the heat was above in the top right corner where the camera ans not where your hand usually holds the phone, so if it does overheat again, how would you know... ):No gyroscope, so don't believe that one answer on BestBuy's product page. (This means Pokemon Go suffers, & my HTC has gyro, shrugs.)Did not come with adaptive storage enabled, so I would have to program it to do so, when my HTC just required a fast enough SD to do so (UHS-3 minimum, which is not cheap, but least likely to give me hiccups).Vibration was extremely easy to feel, which was pleasant, because it was strong enough to feel, but not too strong that the phone moves on a table surface.Speakers are at the bottom, but I still heard it. My HTC has front facing speakers, so I cannot compare effectively, since front facing is already a bias.Other than that, I didn't really test anything else.Nothing on battery life, GPS, phone clarity.. Please ask any questions you have, as I will probably be able to tell you directly from my short time with it.Yes, I did return it. (:"
"391701","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB Black (US Warranty)",1,"Battery suck, have to charge 2 times a day. I hope I can return."
"391702","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB Black (US Warranty)",1,"Reall love this phone but the battery is terrible! And for some reason as others have said the WiFi and cell radio turn off on their own for no apparent reason. This really sucks as everything else about this phone is fantastic. Changing to 1 star because now the mic stopped working and no one can hear me."
"391703","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB Black (US Warranty)",1,"Camera stopped working on the second day after release and simply states ""Unfortunately the camera has stopped working"". A quick google search revealed this is a common problem with Sony phones.On 8/11/2016 another update was released and now bluetooth doesn't connect.I am using the Ultra with T-mobile USA. The phone had no problem connecting to the network once the sim card was inserted but it takes for ever to initiate the call. After dialing a number or selecting a contact to call it takes a good 10-20 seconds for the dial tone to start. These calls are made in a major city and I have never had this problem with other cell phones.Coming from a note 5, the screen quality isn't the best. I was willing to sacrifice resolution for size but at this point I regret the purchase. I will be returning this phone due too all the problems."

"391705","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB Black (US Warranty)",5,"The phone is very nice,, the only problem I see is that the box is been opened and the ear bug is missing, I have seen some videos of the unboxing phone and I know it come with the ear bugs,"
"391706","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB Black (US Warranty)",4,"Good product, slightly large in size for a small palm. Accessory is simple, only a charger included. It took several days to be prepared for shipment, but superisingly got it by taking only one day after the shipment."
"391707","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB Black (US Warranty)",1,"Very disappointed. I had sony from LT15i Arc until Z3 last year. Then I decided try this phone since I had Z Ultra.The phone top and lower frames are plastic material, already 1 small scratch on it once I open the box.Back is also plastic, soft and thin material. If you hit it by finger, you can feel gap between this back and battery.Battery life is really bad, put there 1 night, 20% battery drop. To get fast charging, you need to purchase extra charger.Screen is OK, but SONY font has issue for Japanese and Tradition Chinese. This is a hardware issue I think, the font database is inside a chip.Not sure if I should keep this phone.For my understand, this phone should be at price of $199 - $239, instead of $329.Consider return this phone and upgrade to XA Performance."
"391708","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB Black (US Warranty)",5,"It's a large phone but deceptively light. Charges fast and the battery holds that charge for over a day (best I got thus far is 55 hours of charge). Sets up fast and simple (you don't need to be super hone savvy to set up). Camera is the best - both the main camera and the selfie camera. Pics are super clear and the options for your pics are pretty varied. Just remember to purchase a MicroSD card with it - the small size of memory will disappear quickly once you start loading apps & taking pics/video."
"391709","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB Black (US Warranty)",1,"The phone itself is great but the software contains a bug that drains the battery fast even while it's asleep. Apparently the bug causes the phone not to enter sleep properly and also a bug dealing with WiFi scanning. Sony is suppose to provide a fix at some point. I like the phone so much that I would like to deal with it until the update but the bug is so bad that I don't think that's possible. For example, my phone had around 55-65% left and after 8 hours of absolutely no use, the battery was completely dead. Even using temporary fixes people provide online couldn't alleviate the problem for me. I'm disappointed that I am going to have to return and look for something else because it has a great screen, takes fabulous pictures, speaker is loud but sounds a little ""tin-y"" and seems to be the perfect size I'm looking for in a phablet. The white option for this phone makes it look sick as well. The only things I would change is have the volume rocker more towards the top of the phone on the side instead of in the middle on the side, move the on/off button to the top of the phone. Moving these would make it easier to use and would make finding a car mount easier. Have a user replaceable battery, and have the phone charge faster (they advertise that it's a fast charge, but coming from a Samsung note 4, it's far from a fast charge. Might have to buy a different charger to accomplish that). And fix the battery drain bug asap.UPDATE: If anyone has purchased this phone and is dealing with the battery drain issue, I have been able to decrease the battery drain by installing the app: 360 Battery Plus and also turning off WiFi scanner in the settings menu. This seems to have made the issue more tolerable if you decide to keep the phone until Sony fixes it. Hope this helps you like it did for me."
"391710","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB Black (US Warranty)",4,"Hello sony fans,I ordered this sony xperia xa ultra and let me tell you that this is an amazing, the only problem that I had with this phone is that it was too large to use as my everyday driver. I was upgrading from my galaxy note 3 because it was time, I would have been ok with the ultra if it wasn't too wide, so instead I ordered the xperia xa ultra N loving it...I guess this phone deserves 5 stars instead of 4 but that's my opinion...good luck yaa."
"391711","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB Black (US Warranty)",4,"I love everything about this phone except the battery life and limited storage. Sony won't let you use the micro SD card as internal storage. The battery life is OK but could be better with a bigger battery. I love how slim the bezels are. You can use it one handed with no problems.The rear camera is average but the front camera is the best out there. The phone is super smooth and the speaker is loud."
"391712","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB Black (US Warranty)",5,"I'm not Tech savvy with all the Technical stuff So here is what I know: Set up a little different in that the Nano Sim card and your SD card are in the same little slot on the side of the phone.Instruction was not clear on exact which one goes Where . Then there's this little tray that You have to put Your Sim card on.( Instructions could have been clearer.)If you make it pass that ,they phone setup itself.Take great pictures a little bigger than I'm use to but that OK cause I got a Case for it."
"391713","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB Black (US Warranty)",4,"I love this phone it is excellent for the price. The only downfall is no LTE on AT&T network you will get H and H+ which is basically 4G. Phone works like a charm otherwise it plays all games really well even intense ones like racing. And the sound alone is really well done. If your on the fence about this phone I say take the leap. The no LTE part is a little bit of a downer but with my usage so far speeds are still really good Facebook and YouTube play well."
"391714","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB Black (US Warranty)",4,"I bought this phone the first day it came out, because I really wanted to have a big screen and my lg g5 only have a 5.3 screen, I am currently using it with cricket wireless and I get signal almost everywhere.pros:-screen alone is 5 stars, is amazing, good quality, good brightness even outside, great whites, love the edgeless design, I'm glad sony still uses lcd panels because amoled screens are prone to burn in.-phone is fast, I haven't experience any slowness or lag, everything opens really fast.-speaker sound is really nice and loud another 5 stars for it.-battery life is the same or better than my lg g5, so I cant really complain here.-call quality is good, signal is good as wellcons:-only 16gb of internal memory, this is my main concern this phone deserves a least 32gb of internal memory, I downloaded a couple games and I only have 1 gb left. unfortunately you cant install apps directly to sd card. You can move some apps to sd card only if the developer allowed it, so some apps wont let you move them to the sd card. so this is a big downside.-hard to find quality cases and screen protectors-miss tap to wake a lot, I think this is one of the reasons I miss my lg g5-miss fast charging, this is the other reason I miss my lg g5 lol.anyways this is a great phone I have no regrets on buying this phone even though I paid full price for it, the only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because this phone deserved more internal storage and a bigger battery.UPDATE 1:after a flawless one week use, this last week the phone started experiencing problems. for some reason as others have said before, the cell radio turn off on their own for no apparent reason. I noticed this only happened when enabling LTE mode on crickets (ATT's network) so unless Sony fixes this before my return period, ill keep it otherwise i will return phone. otherwise this is a fantastic device.UPDATE 2:SONY issued an update which fixed the lte dropping issue, now this phone is perfect"

"391716","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB Black (US Warranty)",4,"Really like this phone. The screen is amazing and its body doesn't feel so heavy, both cameras take excellent photos, but selfies cam is the best. Apps run fast and price is affordable."
"391717","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB Black (US Warranty)",5,"After a few months of use, I could say this phone was the best phone I ever had, I was sick of Apple and Samsung, I am so satisfied with this phone.The only problem with this phone is the poor battery life .. otherwise, if you consider the pricing this is the best phone .. large screen , impressive performance, and Selfie King !Compared the screen quality with a Galaxy Note 5 and because the Note 5 comes with Higher Resolution it shows better picture, but screen quality is same as iPhone 6x ..I am using T-MOBILE and Network works prefect, 4G / Everything Prefect..Speaker quality is good, make sure to update the phone to latest version.. Sony's latest update will resolve many problems and do reset factory after update make the phone to boot up clean on new firmware and then install your programsit has not much bloatware like provider locked cellphones BUT consider buying Extra Memory it doesn't cost you much .. because there is not much space left on the cellphone storage ( > 10GB )UNFORTUNATELY as today I couldn't find a good screen protector for it, all you can buy are junk** I attached a photo about the camera Performance and Cellphone Package itself **"

They forgot to send me the SIM and SD card but they refunded $72 for me to get it on my own. It really is a cool phone I have nothing else to say, definitely better than the Iphone 6s and definitely better than Samsung. Front camera is amazing, email is amazing, downloads and everything are smooth and fast, the bigger screen lets me not have to squint at my phone all day. I have the white version. I mean yeah the battery doesnt last long but at least it doesnt die at 8% when you're on the phone, it actually stays until the 1%."
"391730","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB Black (US Warranty)",4,"For the price you pay, this phone is great. It's not a flagship there could be some improvements. The camera is great, but with night pics you have to learn how to play with the settings to take great pics. The music player is good, the sound from its speaker is very clear and loud."
"391731","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB Black (US Warranty)",4,"I was a iPhone 5 user, and during my trip to China this summer I used Samsung J3 and later I switched to a Sony M4 Aqua (Hongkong version, dual SIM card), that's how I started to play with Android and Sony stuff.The feeling this XA Ultra is terrific! At least my own experience on communication and light app use are good enough. Watching movie is an enjoy. But sorry I don't take photos/selfies very often, so no comments on it :-)Good news for bug fix:At least on my side, AT&T's problem is now solved. Switching between HSPA (H or H+) and LTE is smooth and not problem was detected.Maybe a bug, but might be a good thing:Battery life is scolded by a lot of users. This is not a problem for me since I often sit in offices, or commute in my car.Actually I found another problem: charging is extremely slow (or even negative, loss of percentage) with some old USB cables (I am using Amazon Basics charger and Kindle's cable). It can be a bug, or maybe it's a security concern from SONY that old or unverified chargers should be limitied.In Android 6.0.1 on other X phones there are soft charging which makes charging slower). No one wants another Samsung Note 7 incident right?BTW, charging on my car (Amazon Basics USB outlet and AB's cable is still on the normal speed as the original SONY charging kit coming with the phone.Bad thing - that's why I removed one star:Storage. SONY insist on a 16GB and no more upgrade is available. (even for the recent XZ and X Compact, they stick to 32G and no more upgrade option available).Also, Android 6.0 has a ""Format as Internal Storage"" feature which allows cellphone to treat external SD card as internal storage. I know it will sacrifice the performance because the external cards are slower, but SONY just blocks it. I know SONY wants to make sure that we can experience smooth performance. But I am not happy with that. I think SONY can provide a warning before customers eventually turns on the feature. Do not follow Apple who confines users in the name of ""so-called"" user experience."
"391732","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB Black (US Warranty)",5,"It's the best phone ever I use to have a iPhone 6s Plus but Sony Xperia beats iphone6s by a huge margin plus the camera quality is amazing"
"391733","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB Black (US Warranty)",3,"I'm quite disappointed with this phone, and I've had it for a week. I'm starting to think that the Gold Lime (a.k.a. Lemon) color is a warning...but these are not issues with this unit. This model, which has so much potential, simply does not have its potential filled. GPS? unreliable. Not by much, but enough to miss a turn here and there. No tap to wake up or lock phone, which is a feature that should be in every Android 6 phone. Turn off screen with case? Not implemented yet, even though Sony sells (in the UK) a case that does that. Security update of May 1st (there have been three updates since then, and this is a new device!). These are all software issues, that should have been taken care of already (there was a software update). I hope that the promised update to Android 7 will be quick and solve these issues.Battery life? Two days, of calls, texts and very limited web access. Use Google Maps, and you will see drain of 20% in an hour. Pokemon Go will drain the battery in an hour or so, and constantly complains about losing GPS and internet (which it then reacquires in a few seconds).Internal storage of 16GB should have been fine with the additional microSD, if only Sony would have allowed its apps to be removed (or at least moved to the card) and the big cache users put their caches on the card. As it currently stands, my phone has 3GB free and I need to be careful of which apps to install. Should have beed 32GB.I have not used the cameras much, so I cannot really say anything about them that other reviews .On the bright side, the screen is beautiful, and the phone very narrow (relative to other 5.5"" and 6"" phones), which makes it easy to hold and use."
"391734","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB Black (US Warranty)",3,"Just receive it two days ago. The phone has a wifi connection problem, when I back home from school, it cannot switch the wifi unless I restart it"

"391738","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB Black (US Warranty)",1,"BUYER BEWARE: If you are an AT&T service user (and that includes all re-sellers.. Cricket etc) this phone's LTE will NOT WORK. I diagnosed it to an issue of dual band towers (such as a tower that transmits both 4,17) this phone is unable to hold the LTE signal (even 200 feet from the tower) and does not just fall back to HSPA but COMPLETELY shuts down and restarts the phones radio. You will find your LTE restarting every 1-2 minutes as said by other users in this review area. This is a problem in the software and Sony's support is so poor all they do is level 1 support involving some lame recommendation to re install the phone software... (will not make a difference) or they blame it on the cell provider saying the bands are not compatible (not true). The phone works great in the areas that transmit only 1 band on the tower (such as by my home) but that is an exception to the rule for AT&T. Almost all their sites are dual band. Not sure how soon Sony plans on fixing this issue but based on the support feedback I received it will not be soon. To prove my point I ordered the previous model C5 ULTRA which is almost the exact same phone and my LTE problem went away, I am now returning this XA ULTRA to Amazon...Sad because otherwise it is an excellent phone for the $ ...Just a word of warning for purchasers of this phone, it will be an issue."

Once again sony has done it, created a good phone, better than those piece of s*** samsung phones!!!!"
"391744","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB Black (US Warranty)",5,"Great looking phone, great performance and signal reception (I have metro with unlimited data), great cameras.Pros: Build quality, aesthetics, signal, cameras, screen quality and tactile responsiveness. The operating system doesn't have too much bloatware and is close to stock android. The phone is narrow so for a 6 inch device it feels very comfortable to handle. MicroSD slot supports high capacity storage.Cons: The rear camera is great but would have liked optical image stabilization on it instead of having it on the selfie camera. The phone is efficient with power consumption but the battery is too small so depending on usage it may not last all day."
"391745","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB Black (US Warranty)",5,"This phone will not disappoint! The first thing you'll notice is the size and beauty of this phone. The sleek design along with the metal frame makes this phone an attractive one. The 6"" full HD screen delivers sharp and clear picture which is perfect for watching videos or flipping through pictures. The sides of the screen curve right into the edges seamlessly which is pleasing to the eye. The front-facing camera is incredible. It even has flash for selfies taken in low-light conditions. Rear-facing camera is no slouch either. The speaker is as loud as most smartphones go but nothing too impressive. The ability to add more storage via the micro-sd card slot is a great touch since it only has about 11GB of usable storage. This phone fairs well with high-end phones and for half the price too, great value!"
"391746","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB Black (US Warranty)",4,"The resolution of the front camera of the XA Ultra which I received is 15 MP instead of 16 MP. Please see photo attached. I'd like to know if this is a defect since it's advertised as a 16 MP front camera. Does anyone else's XA Ultra have a 15 MP front camera resolution? Besides that, I like the display, although the lowest brightness is brighter than what I'm used to coming from a Galaxy. The flash on the front camera is nice to have, and I'd miss it. I wouldn't stare towards the front camera flash for too long since it's very bright for the eyes. And about the battery, after 5 hrs 48 min of time on, it's at 29% battery. I wasn't used to all the buttons being on the right side of the camera in the position that they're in since my palm kept bumping into the volume and camera buttons. It was less of a problem touching the camera button because the camera wouldn't be activated unless it is firmly depressed. However, slightly touching the volume button would cause the volume to adjust unintentionally. Either way, I didn't like those buttons being in the way like that. Definitely have to compromise with this phone."
"391747","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB Black (US Warranty)",1,"I have tested two separate units and the results are the same: There appears to be an LTE issue with AT&T. It just drops completely, then comes back, then drops again constantly. It does not fall back to HSPA. If you change the network mode to HSPA, it will stay connected, but if you have the Network Mode set to anything with LTE, it will drop all connectivity periodically. All APNs were correct and I even tried some older ones. I have 5 other Android phones and all of them maintain connectivity fine with the same SIM card.As a result, I didn't get to properly test the device. I processed a return on the first device and then just immediately tested the connectivity on the second device. Confirming that the issue was the same, I returned that one as well. Sony could probably fix this with a software update, if you're on AT&T, this is a no go unless you're willing to live with HSPA and change some settings."

The six inches screen is lovely and elegant."
"391749","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB Black (US Warranty)",4,"This phone is great. I love it. There are some issues with it though. Sometimes the WiFi won't connect even though there is Wi-Fi present. The solution to this is to restart your phone. This could be cumbersome to some. Not all of the phones have this issue but it's not just my phone that had this issue. You're playing Russian Roulette trying to get one that doesn't. The phone also Response a little slow sometimes when you try to turn the screen on. Nothing major. It really isn't that bad. Lastly, snapchat doesn't use the camera to its full potential. The camera is great. I love it and have no problems with it. I just feel that the quality of snapchat pictures aren't on par with pictures you take with the regular camera app. Just the issue I have with the phone. It would be nice to have more memory. 16 GB isn't good enough when the phone takes more than half of it to function. You can buy a memory card to expand it which is great. Overall I am still pretty happy with this phone. Not a bad product considering the price you get it for. If anyone has any questions I did not answer contact me and I will be happy to help."

This Sony Phone has one of the best Camera's out there one any Phone unless you get the other Sony Phone what will cost you 2 to 3 Hundred $$$ more. This is a great Phone for the Price you getting what you pay fore and more but for me i think i will wait now for a newer Sony Phone and will Play with this Phone for awhile it is still better than a Apple Phone. This is a very good Phone for the Price no more and no less very Good Sony but we need a much better Battery, but not like Samsung or Apple where your phone melts down LOL."

At first I wasn't looking for a flagship phone or something super high tech I just needed something that worked. When I purchased the phone I knew what I was getting I checked out the specs and everything. When it arrived I was excited to get it set up and ready for use. After Updating the phone I realized that I only had 5 gigabytes left of internal phone storage which I thought was ridiculous. So there was over 10 GIGS OF UPDATES!!!! Absolutely Ridiculous. I really liked the size of the phone but that was really the only thing that stood out as far as appearance goes but lacked a finger print scanner and other features that most phones have now a days especially for this price. I really recommend looking elsewhere for a phone with better features and that is more up to date than the XA Ultra. Overall its just a really mediocre phone."

"391769","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB Black (US Warranty)",4,"The good:The phone is a huge improvement over my 3 year old HTC One M8.It does everything I need a phone for, including actually making calls.I've had no connectivity or battery issues, it came up instantly on the AT&T network, and I've been impressed with the screen and overall responsiveness.The not so good:This phone has hit the floor more often in the week that I've owned it than all of my other phones combined.There are several contributing factors, including the size, the almost frictionless back, and the tendency to get buried under various objects on my desk while connected to headphones, leading me to forget about and fling it off into space when moving.The last drop was catastrophic- directly face down onto a bathroom tile floor, and the front glass shattered.This is the first time I've ever damaged a phone in such a fashion, and it was a mildly traumatic experience.Yes, first world problems, I know.The irony of the situation is that the protective case I ordered for the phone arrives today.Unfortunately, the glass and the touch screen are integral to one another, and I was quoted a price of over 200 dollars to repair.Bummer.Hence the title of this review- seriously, don't start using this phone without a case unless you live in a completely carpeted world, or never, ever take your phone into a room with hard tile floors, or probably, even outside."

I'm still trying to figure out how to work everything out.But it is beautiful, maybe a little too big for me but I'm truly satisfied. The camera is pretty okay as well"
"391772","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB Black (US Warranty)",3,"Before I decided to buy this phone, numerous reviews and researches had been done. Then this phone became my final choice.This is a decent phone. There are quite a few concerns online over the battery, screen resolution, and the main camera's lack of optical image stabilizer.Well, I'd like to say that after having this phone for couple of days, the only thing I don't find entirely satisfying is the main camera. Although it comes with 21.5 mega pixels, the quality of the photos really isn't any better than the main camera on the LG G3, which has 13 mega pixels.The 1920x1080p screen is great, and sometime can be rather too bright, but such problem can be taken care of by dialing the brightness down several notches.Battery wise, when it's fully charged, two 120mins movies on Netflix, 20 plus photographs taken with flash, on and off web browsing, numerous text messages exchange on two messengers, all done in the time span of 7 hours, can be sustained by the battery with still 8% left.It also doesn't take more than two hours to fully charge the battery, despite some reviews online. I have noticed that it has taken about a minute to charge a little more than 1% of the power. From 3% to 100%, the battery on my phone took about 93 minutes.Another thing is that I have watched a review on You Tube about somebody claiming that this phone doesn't allow apps to be saved on the additional memory card. Well, I have no problem transfer most of my apps on to the SD card, so just for the reference.Anyway, for a mid-range phone at this price, it is not bad."

In terms of price and quality, with the qualities this phone has to offer the price is indeed very reasonable!"
"391775","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB Black (US Warranty)",1,"Please avoid this phone and any phone by SONY at all cost.I really try to avoid posting negative reviews on here and instead try to reach the manufacturer customer support first. What I experienced, I do not think no customer would want to go through. Just to provide a backstory, I have had Sony Z5 premium which died on October 31st suddenly. I called Sony customer care who stated there is nothing they could do. Also, it would take MORE than a month to get your device back (there is no loaner and you pay return shipping on your dime). Since I liked the clean design of SONY, I thought I would buy something I am used to and was cheap. This phone was on sale for $299 and with 6 inch display, I thought it was perfect. It is far less than perfect and I have hated every second of it. Here are the problems that I have encountered:- The screen becomes non responsive at times. You would click and it would be like Windows 98 trying to figure how to reload on like BBC News app. I think the processor they put on is poor for 2016 and future use. If that is not annoying, what really bugged me is the display screen would do ghosting. By ghosting, the screen will be frozen but you could see there some thing, like a ghost, is touching the screen. Since the screen is curved, I think the pressure makes the screen act out. The ghost touches happen on all four corners.- When you are calling someone, the call would not go through. You would see the caller dialing but it will stay static. The resolution is to drop the call and try again. God have mercy when you call through your car's bluetooth or put it on the speaker - you cannot hear the dail going out and you would not hear the person when he will pick up. You have to hang up and call again.- 16 GB's is a joke. Seriously. Because with the updates that SONY released after the phone was launched, it is actually like 10 Gb's or less. This will fill up your phone fast. I am on 7 Gb's and the phone feels like it is on its last legs with the performance. Be warned.Now the good news - Even the person won't be able to hear you, the network signal and the SAR rating on this phone is good! Where I cannot usually get a signal or a poor signal with my previous phone, this phone gets it. (T-Mobile network). The battery life is also good, which is useful for staring at the phone after it takes forever to work."
"391776","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB Black (US Warranty)",5,"WOW!! First of all, bought used through Amazon Prime and I was shocked when I opened it. It looked like it was new. . Not a scratch, in original box, look like factory wrapping. . The phone itself works well, very big screen and quite fast for everyday use, (It is not a Samsung S7 fast). The only drawback is the internal memory (16 gig) but I put in aa external memory card and used APP2SD app to move some apps to it. Great phone for the Money, very happy with it and Amazon."

It's been 2 months using this phone and I'm very glad that I chose this model. Is a great phone, wonderful screen, and nice frontal/back camera with average picture quality. The six inches screen is lovely and elegant."
"391779","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB Lime Gold (US Warranty)",4,"This phone is great. I love it. There are some issues with it though. Sometimes the WiFi won't connect even though there is Wi-Fi present. The solution to this is to restart your phone. This could be cumbersome to some. Not all of the phones have this issue but it's not just my phone that had this issue. You're playing Russian Roulette trying to get one that doesn't. The phone also Response a little slow sometimes when you try to turn the screen on. Nothing major. It really isn't that bad. Lastly, snapchat doesn't use the camera to its full potential. The camera is great. I love it and have no problems with it. I just feel that the quality of snapchat pictures aren't on par with pictures you take with the regular camera app. Just the issue I have with the phone. It would be nice to have more memory. 16 GB isn't good enough when the phone takes more than half of it to function. You can buy a memory card to expand it which is great. Overall I am still pretty happy with this phone. Not a bad product considering the price you get it for. If anyone has any questions I did not answer contact me and I will be happy to help."

I don't know what Sony was thinking when they brought this Phone out. I still like it better than these Apple IFLOP Phones i retired my IFLOP Phones that 6 & 7 Sucks. This Sony Phone has one of the best Camera's out there one any Phone unless you get the other Sony Phone what will cost you 2 to 3 Hundred $$$ more. This is a great Phone for the Price you getting what you pay fore and more but for me i think i will wait now for a newer Sony Phone and will Play with this Phone for awhile it is still better than a Apple Phone. This is a very good Phone for the Price no more and no less very Good Sony but we need a much better Battery, but not like Samsung or Apple where your phone melts down LOL."

"391787","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB Lime Gold (US Warranty)",1,"I needed a new phone so I was shopping around for one and came across the ""Sony Xperia XA Ultra"" don't be fooled by the fancy name it's not as great as it sounds. At first I wasn't looking for a flagship phone or something super high tech I just needed something that worked. When I purchased the phone I knew what I was getting I checked out the specs and everything. When it arrived I was excited to get it set up and ready for use. After Updating the phone I realized that I only had 5 gigabytes left of internal phone storage which I thought was ridiculous. So there was over 10 GIGS OF UPDATES!!!! Absolutely Ridiculous. I really liked the size of the phone but that was really the only thing that stood out as far as appearance goes but lacked a finger print scanner and other features that most phones have now a days especially for this price. I really recommend looking elsewhere for a phone with better features and that is more up to date than the XA Ultra. Overall its just a really mediocre phone."
"391788","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB Lime Gold (US Warranty)",5,"I'm a cell phone addict, I have played with a number of devices ranging from the Oneplus 2, Galaxy S7, and Nexus 6P over the past year. I have to say for 298 with the 64gb sd card, this was a steal. The build quality of the device is fantastic, it has NFC, and a 1080P display. The battery while not large seems to work just fine, and Stamina mode can help extend the life even further.I'm averaging about 5.5 to 6 hours of screen on time which for a 2700 mah battery, 6"" display, and octacore processor is fantastic. Signal seems to be strong, and reliable, call quality is good and bluetooth works great. The cameras are solid as well I've been snapping pics of my dog. Performance is solid, while it is in fact a Mediatek P10 processor it is more than capable of handling day to day tasks and basic gaming. The screen is responsive, and clear, with good viewing angles, and is an AMOLED panel.The build quality of the phone is top notch, it feels great and balanced in your hand, and while extremely large is a smaller footprint than an iPhone 6s Plus or original Nexus 6 thanks to the bezeless sides.Only thing I wish this had is a fingerprint reader, and a tap to wake feature so I didn't always need to use the power button. Other than that I love my new device!"

Adding contacts from messaging is strange, but can be done fine. Alarms are great because I can have as many as I want. All in all its a decent mobile where I can add more storage. The cost was also decent and the battery lasts me about two days.Pleased I bought it."
"391795","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB Lime Gold (US Warranty)",1,"I bought a Sony Xperia XA Ultra on Amazon, new with a US warranty, and I am having so many problems with it.1. I have a 10-30 second delay when initiating a call (dialing out) before it connects, even with full signal in a major city.2. There is no WiFi calling with T-Mobile, which is a big issue especially as someone who works in a hospital where there is no signal due to all the interference from the walls, MRI's and CT scanners, but WiFi is everywhere. It seems most people buying this phone seem to be using it on T-Mobile in the United States and that is a critical feature that most other phones have, including unlocked OEM phones from other companies. Surprised it's not even an option to enable like other competitors (One Plus 3, ALL Samsung devices, Apple iPhones, etc).3. The screen brightness isn't auto adjusting properly even with the setting for adaptive brightness being on.4. Having the volume rocker on the right next to the power button AND the camera button is silly. They are inadvertantly hit.5. The Mediatek CPU is kinda slow and the Wifi module onboard is significantly slower than a Qualcomm chipet.6. No fingerprint scannerFirmware is up to date with the latest software as of 10/22/2016:BUILD: 36.0.A.2.109Model F32131/5 star rating until Sony fixes the MANY MAJOR issues.UPDATE: Sony released a firmware update, and I have updated above the latest firmware for this handset. The phone STILL has ALL of the issues above, AND now has worse battery life. This phone is really a piece of crap. The only thing making me keep it is how cheap it is for the size of the screen.UPDATE 2: Sony Customer support is absolutely TERRIBLE. I have tried communicating with them in numerous ways and multiple attempts, and they have no clue how to go off script to help. Their solution is sto send in my unit (I've gone through a few replacements at this point, so it's not the ""unit"", it's piss poor engineering and software support.UPDATE 3: The phone is noticiably slower and gettigng very sluggish with only 3 weeks of use so far.

I have to say that I love this phone it's just the cat's meow nice big screen lots of great features inmates calls with no problem. There's a lot of reviews that are pre software update about LTE problems which have been addressed they've upgraded the software so the battery last longer. I don't get me wrong it's still not the longest lasting battery but you get about what you get with your other phones like the Samsung Galaxy and many of the other phones. Huawei has this hands down as does Apple from what I understand. Not much I can say bad about this phone few times the speaker has locked up on me and is not heard me when I was answering calls for asking Google a question. I rebooted a couple times and it's fine. It may turn out to be a problem although after the reboot it's been fine as I said. For the price I don't know that you can do much better it's a really good phone."

"391812","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB Lime Gold (US Warranty)",4,"This is a review comparing this phone to the HTC Desire Eye, on Android 6.0 Marshmallow.I got this phone with the Sony MicroSD 64GB deal for $306 ish after tax & free one-day shipping. Amazon told me I'd get it by the 15th, but it literally came next day, so hands off to you, Amazon.Screen : yes, it is extremely bigger than the HTC, by a whole .8 inches; the keyboard felt so much better on the Xperia XA Ultra, but that's just because my fingers had the space to press the right key. BUT quality wise, I was not impressed when I had my HTC right next to the Xperia. Fooled me, my HTC had a brighter and more clear colorful screen, even with the stock Xperia wallpaper applied.Camera : Oh boy, I was sad the minute it was opened. Colors were washed out in normal sunlit rooms, no way to save preferred options on top of the Superior Auto, and biggest difference between the HTC stock camera was the selfie front camera had no way to beautify in-app. I would have to download a separate app ): Nor was the front camera even clear; the focus on my HTC was superior. This was the deal breaker for me.Speed : Camera shutter speed was the same, camera start up speed was the same, picture processing after capture is slower on xperia, opening apps on the same wifi network was the same, opening apps on data plan was same, download speeds the same wifi and data wise, start up from power down was slower on the Xperia.Interface : Though I am used to HTC Sense Home layout, the Sony UI was not hard to navigate through, I found everything I needed quick or with some fast reading. I mean, the Sony one stuck with the notification drop down menu from vanilla Android, which was a nice difference to look at. But HTC could fit and has more options for the settings in the drop down, such as an extra row at the bottom for 12 options rather than just 9. You'd think you can fit more on a bigger screen, but Sony just didn't program it to utilize it that way. Shrugs.Two software updates straight out of the box, though the first was a quick update, but the second took a little longer to boot.Is okay, slight overheat in first start up and set up, but that's normal for any phone. But my concern is that the heat was above in the top right corner where the camera ans not where your hand usually holds the phone, so if it does overheat again, how would you know... ):No gyroscope, so don't believe that one answer on BestBuy's product page. (This means Pokemon Go suffers, & my HTC has gyro, shrugs.)Did not come with adaptive storage enabled, so I would have to program it to do so, when my HTC just required a fast enough SD to do so (UHS-3 minimum, which is not cheap, but least likely to give me hiccups).Vibration was extremely easy to feel, which was pleasant, because it was strong enough to feel, but not too strong that the phone moves on a table surface.Speakers are at the bottom, but I still heard it. My HTC has front facing speakers, so I cannot compare effectively, since front facing is already a bias.Other than that, I didn't really test anything else.Nothing on battery life, GPS, phone clarity.. Please ask any questions you have, as I will probably be able to tell you directly from my short time with it.Yes, I did return it. (:"

The phone had no problem connecting to the network once the sim card was inserted but it takes for ever to initiate the call. After dialing a number or selecting a contact to call it takes a good 10-20 seconds for the dial tone to start. These calls are made in a major city and I have never had this problem with other cell phones.Coming from a note 5, the screen quality isn't the best.

"391819","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB Lime Gold (US Warranty)",1,"Very disappointed. I had sony from LT15i Arc until Z3 last year. Then I decided try this phone since I had Z Ultra.The phone top and lower frames are plastic material, already 1 small scratch on it once I open the box.Back is also plastic, soft and thin material. If you hit it by finger, you can feel gap between this back and battery.Battery life is really bad, put there 1 night, 20% battery drop. To get fast charging, you need to purchase extra charger.Screen is OK, but SONY font has issue for Japanese and Tradition Chinese. This is a hardware issue I think, the font database is inside a chip.Not sure if I should keep this phone.For my understand, this phone should be at price of $199 - $239, instead of $329.Consider return this phone and upgrade to XA Performance."
"391820","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB Lime Gold (US Warranty)",1,"BUYER BEWARE: If you are an AT&T service user (and that includes all re-sellers.. Cricket etc) this phone's LTE will NOT WORK. I diagnosed it to an issue of dual band towers (such as a tower that transmits both 4,17) this phone is unable to hold the LTE signal (even 200 feet from the tower) and does not just fall back to HSPA but COMPLETELY shuts down and restarts the phones radio. You will find your LTE restarting every 1-2 minutes as said by other users in this review area. This is a problem in the software and Sony's support is so poor all they do is level 1 support involving some lame recommendation to re install the phone software... (will not make a difference) or they blame it on the cell provider saying the bands are not compatible (not true). The phone works great in the areas that transmit only 1 band on the tower (such as by my home) but that is an exception to the rule for AT&T. Almost all their sites are dual band. Not sure how soon Sony plans on fixing this issue but based on the support feedback I received it will not be soon. To prove my point I ordered the previous model C5 ULTRA which is almost the exact same phone and my LTE problem went away, I am now returning this XA ULTRA to Amazon...Sad because otherwise it is an excellent phone for the $ ...Just a word of warning for purchasers of this phone, it will be an issue."

The operating system doesn't have too much bloatware and is close to stock android. The phone is narrow so for a 6 inch device it feels very comfortable to handle. MicroSD slot supports high capacity storage.Cons: The rear camera is great but would have liked optical image stabilization on it instead of having it on the selfie camera. The phone is efficient with power consumption but the battery is too small so depending on usage it may not last all day."
"391827","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB Lime Gold (US Warranty)",5,"This phone will not disappoint! The first thing you'll notice is the size and beauty of this phone. The sleek design along with the metal frame makes this phone an attractive one. The 6"" full HD screen delivers sharp and clear picture which is perfect for watching videos or flipping through pictures. The sides of the screen curve right into the edges seamlessly which is pleasing to the eye. The front-facing camera is incredible. It even has flash for selfies taken in low-light conditions. Rear-facing camera is no slouch either. The speaker is as loud as most smartphones go but nothing too impressive. The ability to add more storage via the micro-sd card slot is a great touch since it only has about 11GB of usable storage. This phone fairs well with high-end phones and for half the price too, great value!"
"391828","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB Lime Gold (US Warranty)",4,"The resolution of the front camera of the XA Ultra which I received is 15 MP instead of 16 MP. Please see photo attached. I'd like to know if this is a defect since it's advertised as a 16 MP front camera. Does anyone else's XA Ultra have a 15 MP front camera resolution? Besides that, I like the display, although the lowest brightness is brighter than what I'm used to coming from a Galaxy. The flash on the front camera is nice to have, and I'd miss it. I wouldn't stare towards the front camera flash for too long since it's very bright for the eyes. And about the battery, after 5 hrs 48 min of time on, it's at 29% battery. I wasn't used to all the buttons being on the right side of the camera in the position that they're in since my palm kept bumping into the volume and camera buttons. It was less of a problem touching the camera button because the camera wouldn't be activated unless it is firmly depressed. However, slightly touching the volume button would cause the volume to adjust unintentionally. Either way, I didn't like those buttons being in the way like that. Definitely have to compromise with this phone."
"391829","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB Lime Gold (US Warranty)",1,"I have tested two separate units and the results are the same: There appears to be an LTE issue with AT&T. It just drops completely, then comes back, then drops again constantly. It does not fall back to HSPA. If you change the network mode to HSPA, it will stay connected, but if you have the Network Mode set to anything with LTE, it will drop all connectivity periodically. All APNs were correct and I even tried some older ones. I have 5 other Android phones and all of them maintain connectivity fine with the same SIM card.As a result, I didn't get to properly test the device. I processed a return on the first device and then just immediately tested the connectivity on the second device. Confirming that the issue was the same, I returned that one as well. Sony could probably fix this with a software update, if you're on AT&T, this is a no go unless you're willing to live with HSPA and change some settings."

"391831","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB Lime Gold (US Warranty)",4,"The good:The phone is a huge improvement over my 3 year old HTC One M8.It does everything I need a phone for, including actually making calls.I've had no connectivity or battery issues, it came up instantly on the AT&T network, and I've been impressed with the screen and overall responsiveness.The not so good:This phone has hit the floor more often in the week that I've owned it than all of my other phones combined.There are several contributing factors, including the size, the almost frictionless back, and the tendency to get buried under various objects on my desk while connected to headphones, leading me to forget about and fling it off into space when moving.The last drop was catastrophic- directly face down onto a bathroom tile floor, and the front glass shattered.This is the first time I've ever damaged a phone in such a fashion, and it was a mildly traumatic experience.Yes, first world problems, I know.The irony of the situation is that the protective case I ordered for the phone arrives today.Unfortunately, the glass and the touch screen are integral to one another, and I was quoted a price of over 200 dollars to repair.Bummer.Hence the title of this review- seriously, don't start using this phone without a case unless you live in a completely carpeted world, or never, ever take your phone into a room with hard tile floors, or probably, even outside."
"391832","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB Lime Gold (US Warranty)",5,"Nice 📱"
"391833","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB Lime Gold (US Warranty)",5,"I wanted a larger phone and have used a BLU phone for a couple years. This phone is amazingly fast. I'm still trying to figure out how to work everything out.But it is beautiful, maybe a little too big for me but I'm truly satisfied. The camera is pretty okay as well"
"391834","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB Lime Gold (US Warranty)",3,"Before I decided to buy this phone, numerous reviews and researches had been done. Then this phone became my final choice.This is a decent phone. There are quite a few concerns online over the battery, screen resolution, and the main camera's lack of optical image stabilizer.Well, I'd like to say that after having this phone for couple of days, the only thing I don't find entirely satisfying is the main camera. Although it comes with 21.5 mega pixels, the quality of the photos really isn't any better than the main camera on the LG G3, which has 13 mega pixels.The 1920x1080p screen is great, and sometime can be rather too bright, but such problem can be taken care of by dialing the brightness down several notches.Battery wise, when it's fully charged, two 120mins movies on Netflix, 20 plus photographs taken with flash, on and off web browsing, numerous text messages exchange on two messengers, all done in the time span of 7 hours, can be sustained by the battery with still 8% left.It also doesn't take more than two hours to fully charge the battery, despite some reviews online. I have noticed that it has taken about a minute to charge a little more than 1% of the power. From 3% to 100%, the battery on my phone took about 93 minutes.Another thing is that I have watched a review on You Tube about somebody claiming that this phone doesn't allow apps to be saved on the additional memory card. Well, I have no problem transfer most of my apps on to the SD card, so just for the reference.Anyway, for a mid-range phone at this price, it is not bad."
"391835","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB Lime Gold (US Warranty)",5,"Excellent product. Very good seller."
"391836","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB Lime Gold (US Warranty)",5,"Perfect phone for me! I love the size which is basically what I need. Plus the screen which is edge-to-edge makes it easier for the eyes ( especially after long hours of reading!) It has a smooth user interface. The pictures are awesome. In terms of price and quality, with the qualities this phone has to offer the price is indeed very reasonable!"
"391837","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB Lime Gold (US Warranty)",1,"Please avoid this phone and any phone by SONY at all cost.I really try to avoid posting negative reviews on here and instead try to reach the manufacturer customer support first. What I experienced, I do not think no customer would want to go through. Just to provide a backstory, I have had Sony Z5 premium which died on October 31st suddenly. I called Sony customer care who stated there is nothing they could do. Also, it would take MORE than a month to get your device back (there is no loaner and you pay return shipping on your dime). Since I liked the clean design of SONY, I thought I would buy something I am used to and was cheap. This phone was on sale for $299 and with 6 inch display, I thought it was perfect. It is far less than perfect and I have hated every second of it. Here are the problems that I have encountered:- The screen becomes non responsive at times. You would click and it would be like Windows 98 trying to figure how to reload on like BBC News app. I think the processor they put on is poor for 2016 and future use. If that is not annoying, what really bugged me is the display screen would do ghosting. By ghosting, the screen will be frozen but you could see there some thing, like a ghost, is touching the screen. Since the screen is curved, I think the pressure makes the screen act out. The ghost touches happen on all four corners.- When you are calling someone, the call would not go through. You would see the caller dialing but it will stay static. The resolution is to drop the call and try again. God have mercy when you call through your car's bluetooth or put it on the speaker - you cannot hear the dail going out and you would not hear the person when he will pick up. You have to hang up and call again.- 16 GB's is a joke. Seriously. Because with the updates that SONY released after the phone was launched, it is actually like 10 Gb's or less. This will fill up your phone fast. I am on 7 Gb's and the phone feels like it is on its last legs with the performance. Be warned.Now the good news - Even the person won't be able to hear you, the network signal and the SAR rating on this phone is good! Where I cannot usually get a signal or a poor signal with my previous phone, this phone gets it. (T-Mobile network). The battery life is also good, which is useful for staring at the phone after it takes forever to work."
"391838","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB Lime Gold (US Warranty)",5,"WOW!! First of all, bought used through Amazon Prime and I was shocked when I opened it. It looked like it was new. . Not a scratch, in original box, look like factory wrapping. . The phone itself works well, very big screen and quite fast for everyday use, (It is not a Samsung S7 fast). The only drawback is the internal memory (16 gig) but I put in aa external memory card and used APP2SD app to move some apps to it. Great phone for the Money, very happy with it and Amazon."

"391849","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB Lime Gold (US Warranty)",3,"The phone came in quick,the only problem I really found was the flap wont close I figure it was damaged during processing but nothing too serious, butis easily opened if I forget about it I will be posting pictures of the damaged side although it is a beautiful phone.And I may buy another one if this one gives out due to the flap"
"391850","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB Lime Gold (US Warranty)",5,"I had the Z3 and The Z Ultra. Both of those phones were flagship devices when they came out, so I thought that buying a midranger might not give me a great experience. so far i love the phone. It has band 12 for T-mobile, but no Volte, but data still works. The camera is decent in low light and great in bright daylight. The phone is not too big to hold like my Z Ultra, and has the ability to have one handed operation. The display is crisp, and 1080 p is plenty for the screens size. i have seen some trouble syncing with my chromecast to screen mirror, but that may be because there is a built in function on the xa ultra that you can sync without having the app. Sound quality is great, and the speaker is decenltly loud. I havent seen the phone be sluggish or slow, and i have about 50 apps on my phone. The white does not get dirty as some have stated. The back feels kind of glossy and it is not like my Z4 tablet, which gets very dirty. The edge to edge display is awesome and playing games and watching videos is a delight. Even N.O.V.A. 3 Ran just fine, so it should be able to play relatively every smartphone game with ease. I love this phone. I don't know what else to say."
"391851","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB Lime Gold (US Warranty)",4,"Yes, this phone is very slick. I like the appearance of this phone a lot, but not so much the inside. No native Video Calls or Notes (very important). The camera wise is alright. I compared it with my old iPhone 5 and I think the iPhone won though. Photography is one of my hobbies and this phone is definitely not for me. I'm returning it. Too much limitations."
"391852","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB Lime Gold (US Warranty)",1,"I have used this phone now for a couple of days and I think for the amount of money I paid it is a huge disappointment. Before I purchased it I was debating if the battery life is good enough or if it could be a issue. Now the battery life is the least of my concern.First off all the phone box itself was not sealed. So there is no proof that the phone is really a new phone.The WIFI issue: Whenever the WIFI area changes the phone does not connect automatically. It starts scanning for available WIFI and scans and scans... It keeps saying ""No WIFI available"" even if I stand directly next to the WIFI Router. After 30 min I usually give up and I reboot the phone. Like I said so far the phone was never able to connect automatically to a different WIFI so I always end up restarting the phone.The Transfer issue: If the phone is connected to the computer to transfer pictures, music, etc. a couple of problems may acure:-The computer is not always able to find the device-If finally connected it does not always display all folders-Sometimes if you open a folder it says Folder empty when it is not-Very often after a couple of minutes connected to the computer a message pops up saying: The device is not working anymore or it is disconnected, which is not true-Most of the time while transferring pictures to the computer it freezes. So I have constantly plug and unplug the device to the computer.Besides the major issues there are some minor issues like:-you can not change the Font-just certain things ( music, pictures, videos) are able to transfer to the sd card-you can not wake up the screen by touching it-no headphones came with the purchase of the phoneProbably there are even more major and minor issues I have not discovered so far, I would definitely not recommend this phone to anyone."

"391856","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB Lime Gold (US Warranty)",3,"I want badly to give this phone a better review. However, after using the Z1 and then the Z2, this phone is a bit of a let down. Sony decided to use a less expensive processor, resulting in a much lower priced phone. This is the great news and the processor seems to be very effective. The bad news is that Sony, for some reason changed some of the things, which made me rave about their phones in the past. The first thing they changed is there is no longer a magnetic charging option. Also, the USB port is not covered making this phone non-waterproof. Without the magnetic charging port, the USB port has to be used. If Sony had made this phone wireless charging compatible, the removal of the magnetic port would not be an issue. Why are so many phones wireless charging capable, but Sony cannot get onboard with this? The fact that it is rapid charging capable is a plus however, I had to purchase a rapid charger separately. Sony also removed the capability to connect to a TV via HDMI/MHL. The only way to connect and play media on a TV is via wireless means (DNLA, Bluetooth). Therefore, if the TV is not up-to-date with those technologies, you are out of luck. Bad move Sony, bad move!! The camera so far does seem to have been upgraded. I was never impressed with the camera on both my Z1 or Z2. What I am curious is if I will still have to use my Microphone STM10 at concerts in order for the sound to not be garbled?"
"391857","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB Lime Gold (US Warranty)",3,"No Wifi CallingOther than that looks good feels good wish it was more popular for more cases and more support from online forums."
"391858","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB Lime Gold (US Warranty)",3,"I'd rte it higher if it didn't have connection issues on the AT&T network."
"391859","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB Lime Gold (US Warranty)",1,"BUYER BEWARE: If you are an AT&T service user (and that includes all re-sellers.. Cricket etc) this phone's LTE will NOT WORK. I diagnosed it to an issue of dual band towers (such as a tower that transmits both 4,17) this phone is unable to hold the LTE signal (even 200 feet from the tower) and does not just fall back to HSPA but COMPLETELY shuts down and restarts the phones radio. You will find your LTE restarting every 1-2 minutes as said by other users in this review area. This is a problem in the software and Sony's support is so poor all they do is level 1 support involving some lame recommendation to re install the phone software... (will not make a difference) or they blame it on the cell provider saying the bands are not compatible (not true). The phone works great in the areas that transmit only 1 band on the tower (such as by my home) but that is an exception to the rule for AT&T. Almost all their sites are dual band. Not sure how soon Sony plans on fixing this issue but based on the support feedback I received it will not be soon. To prove my point I ordered the previous model C5 ULTRA which is almost the exact same phone and my LTE problem went away, I am now returning this XA ULTRA to Amazon...Sad because otherwise it is an excellent phone for the $ ...Just a word of warning for purchasers of this phone, it will be an issue."
"391860","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB Lime Gold (US Warranty)",5,"I don't normally write reviews because everything I get online is ""alright"", but this phone is really wonderful. They forgot to send me the SIM and SD card but they refunded $72 for me to get it on my own. It really is a cool phone I have nothing else to say, definitely better than the Iphone 6s and definitely better than Samsung. Front camera is amazing, email is amazing, downloads and everything are smooth and fast, the bigger screen lets me not have to squint at my phone all day. I have the white version. I mean yeah the battery doesnt last long but at least it doesnt die at 8% when you're on the phone, it actually stays until the 1%."
"391861","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB Lime Gold (US Warranty)",4,"For the price you pay, this phone is great. It's not a flagship there could be some improvements. The camera is great, but with night pics you have to learn how to play with the settings to take great pics. The music player is good, the sound from its speaker is very clear and loud."
"391862","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB Lime Gold (US Warranty)",4,"I was a iPhone 5 user, and during my trip to China this summer I used Samsung J3 and later I switched to a Sony M4 Aqua (Hongkong version, dual SIM card), that's how I started to play with Android and Sony stuff.The feeling this XA Ultra is terrific! At least my own experience on communication and light app use are good enough. Watching movie is an enjoy. But sorry I don't take photos/selfies very often, so no comments on it :-)Good news for bug fix:At least on my side, AT&T's problem is now solved. Switching between HSPA (H or H+) and LTE is smooth and not problem was detected.Maybe a bug, but might be a good thing:Battery life is scolded by a lot of users. This is not a problem for me since I often sit in offices, or commute in my car.Actually I found another problem: charging is extremely slow (or even negative, loss of percentage) with some old USB cables (I am using Amazon Basics charger and Kindle's cable). It can be a bug, or maybe it's a security concern from SONY that old or unverified chargers should be limitied.In Android 6.0.1 on other X phones there are soft charging which makes charging slower). No one wants another Samsung Note 7 incident right?BTW, charging on my car (Amazon Basics USB outlet and AB's cable is still on the normal speed as the original SONY charging kit coming with the phone.Bad thing - that's why I removed one star:Storage. SONY insist on a 16GB and no more upgrade is available. (even for the recent XZ and X Compact, they stick to 32G and no more upgrade option available).Also, Android 6.0 has a ""Format as Internal Storage"" feature which allows cellphone to treat external SD card as internal storage. I know it will sacrifice the performance because the external cards are slower, but SONY just blocks it. I know SONY wants to make sure that we can experience smooth performance. But I am not happy with that. I think SONY can provide a warning before customers eventually turns on the feature. Do not follow Apple who confines users in the name of ""so-called"" user experience."
"391863","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB Lime Gold (US Warranty)",5,"It's the best phone ever I use to have a iPhone 6s Plus but Sony Xperia beats iphone6s by a huge margin plus the camera quality is amazing"
"391864","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB Lime Gold (US Warranty)",3,"I'm quite disappointed with this phone, and I've had it for a week. I'm starting to think that the Gold Lime (a.k.a. Lemon) color is a warning...but these are not issues with this unit. This model, which has so much potential, simply does not have its potential filled. GPS? unreliable. Not by much, but enough to miss a turn here and there. No tap to wake up or lock phone, which is a feature that should be in every Android 6 phone. Turn off screen with case? Not implemented yet, even though Sony sells (in the UK) a case that does that. Security update of May 1st (there have been three updates since then, and this is a new device!). These are all software issues, that should have been taken care of already (there was a software update). I hope that the promised update to Android 7 will be quick and solve these issues.Battery life? Two days, of calls, texts and very limited web access. Use Google Maps, and you will see drain of 20% in an hour. Pokemon Go will drain the battery in an hour or so, and constantly complains about losing GPS and internet (which it then reacquires in a few seconds).Internal storage of 16GB should have been fine with the additional microSD, if only Sony would have allowed its apps to be removed (or at least moved to the card) and the big cache users put their caches on the card. As it currently stands, my phone has 3GB free and I need to be careful of which apps to install. Should have beed 32GB.I have not used the cameras much, so I cannot really say anything about them that other reviews .On the bright side, the screen is beautiful, and the phone very narrow (relative to other 5.5"" and 6"" phones), which makes it easy to hold and use."

"391870","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB Lime Gold (US Warranty)",1,"The phone itself is great but the software contains a bug that drains the battery fast even while it's asleep. Apparently the bug causes the phone not to enter sleep properly and also a bug dealing with WiFi scanning. Sony is suppose to provide a fix at some point. I like the phone so much that I would like to deal with it until the update but the bug is so bad that I don't think that's possible. For example, my phone had around 55-65% left and after 8 hours of absolutely no use, the battery was completely dead. Even using temporary fixes people provide online couldn't alleviate the problem for me. I'm disappointed that I am going to have to return and look for something else because it has a great screen, takes fabulous pictures, speaker is loud but sounds a little ""tin-y"" and seems to be the perfect size I'm looking for in a phablet. The white option for this phone makes it look sick as well. The only things I would change is have the volume rocker more towards the top of the phone on the side instead of in the middle on the side, move the on/off button to the top of the phone. Moving these would make it easier to use and would make finding a car mount easier. Have a user replaceable battery, and have the phone charge faster (they advertise that it's a fast charge, but coming from a Samsung note 4, it's far from a fast charge. Might have to buy a different charger to accomplish that). And fix the battery drain bug asap.UPDATE: If anyone has purchased this phone and is dealing with the battery drain issue, I have been able to decrease the battery drain by installing the app: 360 Battery Plus and also turning off WiFi scanner in the settings menu. This seems to have made the issue more tolerable if you decide to keep the phone until Sony fixes it. Hope this helps you like it did for me."
"391871","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB Lime Gold (US Warranty)",4,"Hello sony fans,I ordered this sony xperia xa ultra and let me tell you that this is an amazing, the only problem that I had with this phone is that it was too large to use as my everyday driver. I was upgrading from my galaxy note 3 because it was time, I would have been ok with the ultra if it wasn't too wide, so instead I ordered the xperia xa ultra N loving it...I guess this phone deserves 5 stars instead of 4 but that's my opinion...good luck yaa."
"391872","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB Lime Gold (US Warranty)",4,"I love everything about this phone except the battery life and limited storage. Sony won't let you use the micro SD card as internal storage. The battery life is OK but could be better with a bigger battery. I love how slim the bezels are.

Then there's this little tray that You have to put Your Sim card on.( Instructions could have been clearer.)If you make it pass that ,they phone setup itself.Take great pictures a little bigger than I'm use to but that OK cause I got a Case for it."
"391874","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB Lime Gold (US Warranty)",4,"I love this phone it is excellent for the price. The only downfall is no LTE on AT&T network you will get H and H+ which is basically 4G. Phone works like a charm otherwise it plays all games really well even intense ones like racing. And the sound alone is really well done. If your on the fence about this phone I say take the leap. The no LTE part is a little bit of a downer but with my usage so far speeds are still really good Facebook and YouTube play well."
"391875","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB Lime Gold (US Warranty)",4,"I bought this phone the first day it came out, because I really wanted to have a big screen and my lg g5 only have a 5.3 screen, I am currently using it with cricket wireless and I get signal almost everywhere.pros:-screen alone is 5 stars, is amazing, good quality, good brightness even outside, great whites, love the edgeless design, I'm glad sony still uses lcd panels because amoled screens are prone to burn in.-phone is fast, I haven't experience any slowness or lag, everything opens really fast.-speaker sound is really nice and loud another 5 stars for it.-battery life is the same or better than my lg g5, so I cant really complain here.-call quality is good, signal is good as wellcons:-only 16gb of internal memory, this is my main concern this phone deserves a least 32gb of internal memory, I downloaded a couple games and I only have 1 gb left. unfortunately you cant install apps directly to sd card. You can move some apps to sd card only if the developer allowed it, so some apps wont let you move them to the sd card. so this is a big downside.-hard to find quality cases and screen protectors-miss tap to wake a lot, I think this is one of the reasons I miss my lg g5-miss fast charging, this is the other reason I miss my lg g5 lol.anyways this is a great phone I have no regrets on buying this phone even though I paid full price for it, the only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because this phone deserved more internal storage and a bigger battery.UPDATE 1:after a flawless one week use, this last week the phone started experiencing problems. for some reason as others have said before, the cell radio turn off on their own for no apparent reason. I noticed this only happened when enabling LTE mode on crickets (ATT's network) so unless Sony fixes this before my return period, ill keep it otherwise i will return phone. otherwise this is a fantastic device.UPDATE 2:SONY issued an update which fixed the lte dropping issue, now this phone is perfect"

Sony's latest update will resolve many problems and do reset factory after update make the phone to boot up clean on new firmware and then install your programsit has not much bloatware like provider locked cellphones BUT consider buying Extra Memory it doesn't cost you much .. because there is not much space left on the cellphone storage ( > 10GB )UNFORTUNATELY as today I couldn't find a good screen protector for it, all you can buy are junk** I attached a photo about the camera Performance and Cellphone Package itself **"
"391879","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB Lime Gold (US Warranty)",5,"I'm a cell phone addict, I have played with a number of devices ranging from the Oneplus 2, Galaxy S7, and Nexus 6P over the past year. I have to say for 298 with the 64gb sd card, this was a steal. The build quality of the device is fantastic, it has NFC, and a 1080P display. The battery while not large seems to work just fine, and Stamina mode can help extend the life even further.I'm averaging about 5.5 to 6 hours of screen on time which for a 2700 mah battery, 6"" display, and octacore processor is fantastic. Signal seems to be strong, and reliable, call quality is good and bluetooth works great. The cameras are solid as well I've been snapping pics of my dog. Performance is solid, while it is in fact a Mediatek P10 processor it is more than capable of handling day to day tasks and basic gaming. The screen is responsive, and clear, with good viewing angles, and is an AMOLED panel.The build quality of the phone is top notch, it feels great and balanced in your hand, and while extremely large is a smaller footprint than an iPhone 6s Plus or original Nexus 6 thanks to the bezeless sides.Only thing I wish this had is a fingerprint reader, and a tap to wake feature so I didn't always need to use the power button. Other than that I love my new device!"

"391881","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB Lime Gold (US Warranty)",4,"This is a review comparing this phone to the HTC Desire Eye, on Android 6.0 Marshmallow.I got this phone with the Sony MicroSD 64GB deal for $306 ish after tax & free one-day shipping. Amazon told me I'd get it by the 15th, but it literally came next day, so hands off to you, Amazon.Screen : yes, it is extremely bigger than the HTC, by a whole .8 inches; the keyboard felt so much better on the Xperia XA Ultra, but that's just because my fingers had the space to press the right key. BUT quality wise, I was not impressed when I had my HTC right next to the Xperia. Fooled me, my HTC had a brighter and more clear colorful screen, even with the stock Xperia wallpaper applied.Camera : Oh boy, I was sad the minute it was opened. Colors were washed out in normal sunlit rooms, no way to save preferred options on top of the Superior Auto, and biggest difference between the HTC stock camera was the selfie front camera had no way to beautify in-app. I would have to download a separate app ): Nor was the front camera even clear; the focus on my HTC was superior. This was the deal breaker for me.Speed : Camera shutter speed was the same, camera start up speed was the same, picture processing after capture is slower on xperia, opening apps on the same wifi network was the same, opening apps on data plan was same, download speeds the same wifi and data wise, start up from power down was slower on the Xperia.Interface : Though I am used to HTC Sense Home layout, the Sony UI was not hard to navigate through, I found everything I needed quick or with some fast reading. I mean, the Sony one stuck with the notification drop down menu from vanilla Android, which was a nice difference to look at. But HTC could fit and has more options for the settings in the drop down, such as an extra row at the bottom for 12 options rather than just 9. You'd think you can fit more on a bigger screen, but Sony just didn't program it to utilize it that way. Shrugs.Two software updates straight out of the box, though the first was a quick update, but the second took a little longer to boot.Is okay, slight overheat in first start up and set up, but that's normal for any phone. But my concern is that the heat was above in the top right corner where the camera ans not where your hand usually holds the phone, so if it does overheat again, how would you know... ):No gyroscope, so don't believe that one answer on BestBuy's product page. (This means Pokemon Go suffers, & my HTC has gyro, shrugs.)Did not come with adaptive storage enabled, so I would have to program it to do so, when my HTC just required a fast enough SD to do so (UHS-3 minimum, which is not cheap, but least likely to give me hiccups).Vibration was extremely easy to feel, which was pleasant, because it was strong enough to feel, but not too strong that the phone moves on a table surface.Speakers are at the bottom, but I still heard it. My HTC has front facing speakers, so I cannot compare effectively, since front facing is already a bias.Other than that, I didn't really test anything else.Nothing on battery life, GPS, phone clarity.. Please ask any questions you have, as I will probably be able to tell you directly from my short time with it.Yes, I did return it. (:"

"391883","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB Lime Gold (US Warranty)",1,"Reall love this phone but the battery is terrible! And for some reason as others have said the WiFi and cell radio turn off on their own for no apparent reason. This really sucks as everything else about this phone is fantastic. Changing to 1 star because now the mic stopped working and no one can hear me."
"391884","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB Lime Gold (US Warranty)",1,"Camera stopped working on the second day after release and simply states ""Unfortunately the camera has stopped working"". A quick google search revealed this is a common problem with Sony phones.On 8/11/2016 another update was released and now bluetooth doesn't connect.I am using the Ultra with T-mobile USA. The phone had no problem connecting to the network once the sim card was inserted but it takes for ever to initiate the call. After dialing a number or selecting a contact to call it takes a good 10-20 seconds for the dial tone to start. These calls are made in a major city and I have never had this problem with other cell phones.Coming from a note 5, the screen quality isn't the best. I was willing to sacrifice resolution for size but at this point I regret the purchase. I will be returning this phone due too all the problems."

"391887","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB Lime Gold (US Warranty)",4,"Good product, slightly large in size for a small palm. Accessory is simple, only a charger included.

"391888","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB Lime Gold (US Warranty)",1,"Very disappointed. I had sony from LT15i Arc until Z3 last year. Then I decided try this phone since I had Z Ultra.The phone top and lower frames are plastic material, already 1 small scratch on it once I open the box.Back is also plastic, soft and thin material. If you hit it by finger, you can feel gap between this back and battery.Battery life is really bad, put there 1 night, 20% battery drop. To get fast charging, you need to purchase extra charger.Screen is OK, but SONY font has issue for Japanese and Tradition Chinese. This is a hardware issue I think, the font database is inside a chip.Not sure if I should keep this phone.For my understand, this phone should be at price of $199 - $239, instead of $329.Consider return this phone and upgrade to XA Performance."
"391889","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB Lime Gold (US Warranty)",5,"It's a large phone but deceptively light. Charges fast and the battery holds that charge for over a day (best I got thus far is 55 hours of charge). Sets up fast and simple (you don't need to be super hone savvy to set up). Camera is the best - both the main camera and the selfie camera. Pics are super clear and the options for your pics are pretty varied. Just remember to purchase a MicroSD card with it - the small size of memory will disappear quickly once you start loading apps & taking pics/video."

"391900","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB White (US Warranty)",5,"It's a large phone but deceptively light.

"391901","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB White (US Warranty)",1,"The phone itself is great but the software contains a bug that drains the battery fast even while it's asleep. Apparently the bug causes the phone not to enter sleep properly and also a bug dealing with WiFi scanning. Sony is suppose to provide a fix at some point. I like the phone so much that I would like to deal with it until the update but the bug is so bad that I don't think that's possible. For example, my phone had around 55-65% left and after 8 hours of absolutely no use, the battery was completely dead. Even using temporary fixes people provide online couldn't alleviate the problem for me. I'm disappointed that I am going to have to return and look for something else because it has a great screen, takes fabulous pictures, speaker is loud but sounds a little ""tin-y"" and seems to be the perfect size I'm looking for in a phablet. The white option for this phone makes it look sick as well. The only things I would change is have the volume rocker more towards the top of the phone on the side instead of in the middle on the side, move the on/off button to the top of the phone. Moving these would make it easier to use and would make finding a car mount easier. Have a user replaceable battery, and have the phone charge faster (they advertise that it's a fast charge, but coming from a Samsung note 4, it's far from a fast charge. Might have to buy a different charger to accomplish that). And fix the battery drain bug asap.UPDATE: If anyone has purchased this phone and is dealing with the battery drain issue, I have been able to decrease the battery drain by installing the app: 360 Battery Plus and also turning off WiFi scanner in the settings menu. This seems to have made the issue more tolerable if you decide to keep the phone until Sony fixes it. Hope this helps you like it did for me."
"391902","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB White (US Warranty)",4,"Hello sony fans,I ordered this sony xperia xa ultra and let me tell you that this is an amazing, the only problem that I had with this phone is that it was too large to use as my everyday driver. I was upgrading from my galaxy note 3 because it was time, I would have been ok with the ultra if it wasn't too wide, so instead I ordered the xperia xa ultra N loving it...I guess this phone deserves 5 stars instead of 4 but that's my opinion...good luck yaa."
"391903","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB White (US Warranty)",4,"I love everything about this phone except the battery life and limited storage. Sony won't let you use the micro SD card as internal storage. The battery life is OK but could be better with a bigger battery. I love how slim the bezels are. You can use it one handed with no problems.The rear camera is average but the front camera is the best out there. The phone is super smooth and the speaker is loud."
"391904","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB White (US Warranty)",5,"I'm not Tech savvy with all the Technical stuff So here is what I know: Set up a little different in that the Nano Sim card and your SD card are in the same little slot on the side of the phone.Instruction was not clear on exact which one goes Where . Then there's this little tray that You have to put Your Sim card on.( Instructions could have been clearer.)If you make it pass that ,they phone setup itself.Take great pictures a little bigger than I'm use to but that OK cause I got a Case for it."
"391905","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB White (US Warranty)",4,"I love this phone it is excellent for the price. The only downfall is no LTE on AT&T network you will get H and H+ which is basically 4G. Phone works like a charm otherwise it plays all games really well even intense ones like racing. And the sound alone is really well done. If your on the fence about this phone I say take the leap. The no LTE part is a little bit of a downer but with my usage so far speeds are still really good Facebook and YouTube play well."
"391906","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB White (US Warranty)",4,"I bought this phone the first day it came out, because I really wanted to have a big screen and my lg g5 only have a 5.3 screen, I am currently using it with cricket wireless and I get signal almost everywhere.pros:-screen alone is 5 stars, is amazing, good quality, good brightness even outside, great whites, love the edgeless design, I'm glad sony still uses lcd panels because amoled screens are prone to burn in.-phone is fast, I haven't experience any slowness or lag, everything opens really fast.-speaker sound is really nice and loud another 5 stars for it.-battery life is the same or better than my lg g5, so I cant really complain here.-call quality is good, signal is good as wellcons:-only 16gb of internal memory, this is my main concern this phone deserves a least 32gb of internal memory, I downloaded a couple games and I only have 1 gb left. unfortunately you cant install apps directly to sd card. You can move some apps to sd card only if the developer allowed it, so some apps wont let you move them to the sd card. so this is a big downside.-hard to find quality cases and screen protectors-miss tap to wake a lot, I think this is one of the reasons I miss my lg g5-miss fast charging, this is the other reason I miss my lg g5 lol.anyways this is a great phone I have no regrets on buying this phone even though I paid full price for it, the only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because this phone deserved more internal storage and a bigger battery.UPDATE 1:after a flawless one week use, this last week the phone started experiencing problems. for some reason as others have said before, the cell radio turn off on their own for no apparent reason. I noticed this only happened when enabling LTE mode on crickets (ATT's network) so unless Sony fixes this before my return period, ill keep it otherwise i will return phone. otherwise this is a fantastic device.UPDATE 2:SONY issued an update which fixed the lte dropping issue, now this phone is perfect"

Sony's latest update will resolve many problems and do reset factory after update make the phone to boot up clean on new firmware and then install your programsit has not much bloatware like provider locked cellphones BUT consider buying Extra Memory it doesn't cost you much .. because there is not much space left on the cellphone storage ( > 10GB )UNFORTUNATELY as today I couldn't find a good screen protector for it, all you can buy are junk** I attached a photo about the camera Performance and Cellphone Package itself **"

"391922","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB White (US Warranty)",4,"The good:The phone is a huge improvement over my 3 year old HTC One M8.It does everything I need a phone for, including actually making calls.I've had no connectivity or battery issues, it came up instantly on the AT&T network, and I've been impressed with the screen and overall responsiveness.The not so good:This phone has hit the floor more often in the week that I've owned it than all of my other phones combined.There are several contributing factors, including the size, the almost frictionless back, and the tendency to get buried under various objects on my desk while connected to headphones, leading me to forget about and fling it off into space when moving.The last drop was catastrophic- directly face down onto a bathroom tile floor, and the front glass shattered.This is the first time I've ever damaged a phone in such a fashion, and it was a mildly traumatic experience.Yes, first world problems, I know.The irony of the situation is that the protective case I ordered for the phone arrives today.Unfortunately, the glass and the touch screen are integral to one another, and I was quoted a price of over 200 dollars to repair.Bummer.Hence the title of this review- seriously, don't start using this phone without a case unless you live in a completely carpeted world, or never, ever take your phone into a room with hard tile floors, or probably, even outside."
"391923","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB White (US Warranty)",5,"Nice 📱"
"391924","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB White (US Warranty)",5,"I wanted a larger phone and have used a BLU phone for a couple years. This phone is amazingly fast. I'm still trying to figure out how to work everything out.But it is beautiful, maybe a little too big for me but I'm truly satisfied. The camera is pretty okay as well"
"391925","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB White (US Warranty)",3,"Before I decided to buy this phone, numerous reviews and researches had been done. Then this phone became my final choice.This is a decent phone. There are quite a few concerns online over the battery, screen resolution, and the main camera's lack of optical image stabilizer.Well, I'd like to say that after having this phone for couple of days, the only thing I don't find entirely satisfying is the main camera. Although it comes with 21.5 mega pixels, the quality of the photos really isn't any better than the main camera on the LG G3, which has 13 mega pixels.The 1920x1080p screen is great, and sometime can be rather too bright, but such problem can be taken care of by dialing the brightness down several notches.Battery wise, when it's fully charged, two 120mins movies on Netflix, 20 plus photographs taken with flash, on and off web browsing, numerous text messages exchange on two messengers, all done in the time span of 7 hours, can be sustained by the battery with still 8% left.It also doesn't take more than two hours to fully charge the battery, despite some reviews online. I have noticed that it has taken about a minute to charge a little more than 1% of the power. From 3% to 100%, the battery on my phone took about 93 minutes.Another thing is that I have watched a review on You Tube about somebody claiming that this phone doesn't allow apps to be saved on the additional memory card. Well, I have no problem transfer most of my apps on to the SD card, so just for the reference.Anyway, for a mid-range phone at this price, it is not bad."
"391926","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB White (US Warranty)",5,"Excellent product. Very good seller."
"391927","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB White (US Warranty)",5,"Perfect phone for me! I love the size which is basically what I need. Plus the screen which is edge-to-edge makes it easier for the eyes ( especially after long hours of reading!) It has a smooth user interface. The pictures are awesome. In terms of price and quality, with the qualities this phone has to offer the price is indeed very reasonable!"
"391928","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB White (US Warranty)",1,"Please avoid this phone and any phone by SONY at all cost.I really try to avoid posting negative reviews on here and instead try to reach the manufacturer customer support first. What I experienced, I do not think no customer would want to go through. Just to provide a backstory, I have had Sony Z5 premium which died on October 31st suddenly. I called Sony customer care who stated there is nothing they could do. Also, it would take MORE than a month to get your device back (there is no loaner and you pay return shipping on your dime). Since I liked the clean design of SONY, I thought I would buy something I am used to and was cheap. This phone was on sale for $299 and with 6 inch display, I thought it was perfect. It is far less than perfect and I have hated every second of it. Here are the problems that I have encountered:- The screen becomes non responsive at times. You would click and it would be like Windows 98 trying to figure how to reload on like BBC News app. I think the processor they put on is poor for 2016 and future use. If that is not annoying, what really bugged me is the display screen would do ghosting. By ghosting, the screen will be frozen but you could see there some thing, like a ghost, is touching the screen. Since the screen is curved, I think the pressure makes the screen act out. The ghost touches happen on all four corners.- When you are calling someone, the call would not go through. You would see the caller dialing but it will stay static. The resolution is to drop the call and try again. God have mercy when you call through your car's bluetooth or put it on the speaker - you cannot hear the dail going out and you would not hear the person when he will pick up. You have to hang up and call again.- 16 GB's is a joke. Seriously. Because with the updates that SONY released after the phone was launched, it is actually like 10 Gb's or less. This will fill up your phone fast. I am on 7 Gb's and the phone feels like it is on its last legs with the performance. Be warned.Now the good news - Even the person won't be able to hear you, the network signal and the SAR rating on this phone is good! Where I cannot usually get a signal or a poor signal with my previous phone, this phone gets it. (T-Mobile network). The battery life is also good, which is useful for staring at the phone after it takes forever to work."
"391929","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB White (US Warranty)",5,"WOW!! First of all, bought used through Amazon Prime and I was shocked when I opened it. It looked like it was new. . Not a scratch, in original box, look like factory wrapping. . The phone itself works well, very big screen and quite fast for everyday use, (It is not a Samsung S7 fast). The only drawback is the internal memory (16 gig) but I put in aa external memory card and used APP2SD app to move some apps to it. Great phone for the Money, very happy with it and Amazon."
"391930","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB White (US Warranty)",5,"I'm a cell phone addict, I have played with a number of devices ranging from the Oneplus 2, Galaxy S7, and Nexus 6P over the past year. I have to say for 298 with the 64gb sd card, this was a steal. The build quality of the device is fantastic, it has NFC, and a 1080P display. The battery while not large seems to work just fine, and Stamina mode can help extend the life even further.I'm averaging about 5.5 to 6 hours of screen on time which for a 2700 mah battery, 6"" display, and octacore processor is fantastic. Signal seems to be strong, and reliable, call quality is good and bluetooth works great. The cameras are solid as well I've been snapping pics of my dog. Performance is solid, while it is in fact a Mediatek P10 processor it is more than capable of handling day to day tasks and basic gaming. The screen is responsive, and clear, with good viewing angles, and is an AMOLED panel.The build quality of the phone is top notch, it feels great and balanced in your hand, and while extremely large is a smaller footprint than an iPhone 6s Plus or original Nexus 6 thanks to the bezeless sides.Only thing I wish this had is a fingerprint reader, and a tap to wake feature so I didn't always need to use the power button. Other than that I love my new device!"
"391931","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB White (US Warranty)",5,"Great 6 inch device for the money! Got to hand it to Sony for making an excellent mid-range smartphone. This XA Ultra screams quality with it's camera, screen, and those side bezels are sexy af. Battery life hasn't been much of an issue.Favorite out of the entire Xperia lineup."
"391932","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB White (US Warranty)",1,"BUYER BEWARE: If you are an AT&T service user (and that includes all re-sellers.. Cricket etc) this phone's LTE will NOT WORK. I diagnosed it to an issue of dual band towers (such as a tower that transmits both 4,17) this phone is unable to hold the LTE signal (even 200 feet from the tower) and does not just fall back to HSPA but COMPLETELY shuts down and restarts the phones radio. You will find your LTE restarting every 1-2 minutes as said by other users in this review area. This is a problem in the software and Sony's support is so poor all they do is level 1 support involving some lame recommendation to re install the phone software... (will not make a difference) or they blame it on the cell provider saying the bands are not compatible (not true). The phone works great in the areas that transmit only 1 band on the tower (such as by my home) but that is an exception to the rule for AT&T. Almost all their sites are dual band. Not sure how soon Sony plans on fixing this issue but based on the support feedback I received it will not be soon. To prove my point I ordered the previous model C5 ULTRA which is almost the exact same phone and my LTE problem went away, I am now returning this XA ULTRA to Amazon...Sad because otherwise it is an excellent phone for the $ ...Just a word of warning for purchasers of this phone, it will be an issue."

I love this phone, it is beautiful, battery is good, love it so much. The cameras are amazing!!!! Love Sony so much, everything i own is sony! Once again sony has done it, created a good phone, better than those piece of s*** samsung phones!!!!"
"391938","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB White (US Warranty)",5,"Great looking phone, great performance and signal reception (I have metro with unlimited data), great cameras.Pros: Build quality, aesthetics, signal, cameras, screen quality and tactile responsiveness. The operating system doesn't have too much bloatware and is close to stock android. The phone is narrow so for a 6 inch device it feels very comfortable to handle. MicroSD slot supports high capacity storage.Cons: The rear camera is great but would have liked optical image stabilization on it instead of having it on the selfie camera. The phone is efficient with power consumption but the battery is too small so depending on usage it may not last all day."
"391939","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB White (US Warranty)",5,"This phone will not disappoint! The first thing you'll notice is the size and beauty of this phone. The sleek design along with the metal frame makes this phone an attractive one. The 6"" full HD screen delivers sharp and clear picture which is perfect for watching videos or flipping through pictures. The sides of the screen curve right into the edges seamlessly which is pleasing to the eye. The front-facing camera is incredible. It even has flash for selfies taken in low-light conditions. Rear-facing camera is no slouch either. The speaker is as loud as most smartphones go but nothing too impressive. The ability to add more storage via the micro-sd card slot is a great touch since it only has about 11GB of usable storage. This phone fairs well with high-end phones and for half the price too, great value!"
"391940","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB White (US Warranty)",4,"The resolution of the front camera of the XA Ultra which I received is 15 MP instead of 16 MP. Please see photo attached. I'd like to know if this is a defect since it's advertised as a 16 MP front camera. Does anyone else's XA Ultra have a 15 MP front camera resolution? Besides that, I like the display, although the lowest brightness is brighter than what I'm used to coming from a Galaxy. The flash on the front camera is nice to have, and I'd miss it. I wouldn't stare towards the front camera flash for too long since it's very bright for the eyes. And about the battery, after 5 hrs 48 min of time on, it's at 29% battery. I wasn't used to all the buttons being on the right side of the camera in the position that they're in since my palm kept bumping into the volume and camera buttons. It was less of a problem touching the camera button because the camera wouldn't be activated unless it is firmly depressed. However, slightly touching the volume button would cause the volume to adjust unintentionally. Either way, I didn't like those buttons being in the way like that. Definitely have to compromise with this phone."
"391941","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB White (US Warranty)",1,"I have tested two separate units and the results are the same: There appears to be an LTE issue with AT&T. It just drops completely, then comes back, then drops again constantly. It does not fall back to HSPA. If you change the network mode to HSPA, it will stay connected, but if you have the Network Mode set to anything with LTE, it will drop all connectivity periodically. All APNs were correct and I even tried some older ones. I have 5 other Android phones and all of them maintain connectivity fine with the same SIM card.As a result, I didn't get to properly test the device. I processed a return on the first device and then just immediately tested the connectivity on the second device. Confirming that the issue was the same, I returned that one as well. Sony could probably fix this with a software update, if you're on AT&T, this is a no go unless you're willing to live with HSPA and change some settings."

"391943","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB White (US Warranty)",5,"I had the Z3 and The Z Ultra. Both of those phones were flagship devices when they came out, so I thought that buying a midranger might not give me a great experience. so far i love the phone. It has band 12 for T-mobile, but no Volte, but data still works. The camera is decent in low light and great in bright daylight. The phone is not too big to hold like my Z Ultra, and has the ability to have one handed operation. The display is crisp, and 1080 p is plenty for the screens size. i have seen some trouble syncing with my chromecast to screen mirror, but that may be because there is a built in function on the xa ultra that you can sync without having the app. Sound quality is great, and the speaker is decenltly loud. I havent seen the phone be sluggish or slow, and i have about 50 apps on my phone. The white does not get dirty as some have stated. The back feels kind of glossy and it is not like my Z4 tablet, which gets very dirty. The edge to edge display is awesome and playing games and watching videos is a delight. Even N.O.V.A. 3 Ran just fine, so it should be able to play relatively every smartphone game with ease. I love this phone. I don't know what else to say."
"391944","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB White (US Warranty)",4,"Yes, this phone is very slick. I like the appearance of this phone a lot, but not so much the inside. No native Video Calls or Notes (very important). The camera wise is alright. I compared it with my old iPhone 5 and I think the iPhone won though. Photography is one of my hobbies and this phone is definitely not for me. I'm returning it. Too much limitations."
"391945","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB White (US Warranty)",1,"I have used this phone now for a couple of days and I think for the amount of money I paid it is a huge disappointment. Before I purchased it I was debating if the battery life is good enough or if it could be a issue. Now the battery life is the least of my concern.First off all the phone box itself was not sealed. So there is no proof that the phone is really a new phone.The WIFI issue: Whenever the WIFI area changes the phone does not connect automatically. It starts scanning for available WIFI and scans and scans... It keeps saying ""No WIFI available"" even if I stand directly next to the WIFI Router. After 30 min I usually give up and I reboot the phone. Like I said so far the phone was never able to connect automatically to a different WIFI so I always end up restarting the phone.The Transfer issue: If the phone is connected to the computer to transfer pictures, music, etc. a couple of problems may acure:-The computer is not always able to find the device-If finally connected it does not always display all folders-Sometimes if you open a folder it says Folder empty when it is not-Very often after a couple of minutes connected to the computer a message pops up saying: The device is not working anymore or it is disconnected, which is not true-Most of the time while transferring pictures to the computer it freezes. So I have constantly plug and unplug the device to the computer.Besides the major issues there are some minor issues like:-you can not change the Font-just certain things ( music, pictures, videos) are able to transfer to the sd card-you can not wake up the screen by touching it-no headphones came with the purchase of the phoneProbably there are even more major and minor issues I have not discovered so far, I would definitely not recommend this phone to anyone."

"391949","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB White (US Warranty)",3,"I want badly to give this phone a better review. However, after using the Z1 and then the Z2, this phone is a bit of a let down. Sony decided to use a less expensive processor, resulting in a much lower priced phone. This is the great news and the processor seems to be very effective. The bad news is that Sony, for some reason changed some of the things, which made me rave about their phones in the past. The first thing they changed is there is no longer a magnetic charging option. Also, the USB port is not covered making this phone non-waterproof. Without the magnetic charging port, the USB port has to be used. If Sony had made this phone wireless charging compatible, the removal of the magnetic port would not be an issue. Why are so many phones wireless charging capable, but Sony cannot get onboard with this? The fact that it is rapid charging capable is a plus however, I had to purchase a rapid charger separately. Sony also removed the capability to connect to a TV via HDMI/MHL. The only way to connect and play media on a TV is via wireless means (DNLA, Bluetooth). Therefore, if the TV is not up-to-date with those technologies, you are out of luck. Bad move Sony, bad move!! The camera so far does seem to have been upgraded. I was never impressed with the camera on both my Z1 or Z2. What I am curious is if I will still have to use my Microphone STM10 at concerts in order for the sound to not be garbled?"

Adding contacts from messaging is strange, but can be done fine. Alarms are great because I can have as many as I want. All in all its a decent mobile where I can add more storage. The cost was also decent and the battery lasts me about two days.Pleased I bought it."
"391957","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB White (US Warranty)",1,"I bought a Sony Xperia XA Ultra on Amazon, new with a US warranty, and I am having so many problems with it.1. I have a 10-30 second delay when initiating a call (dialing out) before it connects, even with full signal in a major city.2. There is no WiFi calling with T-Mobile, which is a big issue especially as someone who works in a hospital where there is no signal due to all the interference from the walls, MRI's and CT scanners, but WiFi is everywhere. It seems most people buying this phone seem to be using it on T-Mobile in the United States and that is a critical feature that most other phones have, including unlocked OEM phones from other companies. Surprised it's not even an option to enable like other competitors (One Plus 3, ALL Samsung devices, Apple iPhones, etc).3. The screen brightness isn't auto adjusting properly even with the setting for adaptive brightness being on.4. Having the volume rocker on the right next to the power button AND the camera button is silly. They are inadvertantly hit.5. The Mediatek CPU is kinda slow and the Wifi module onboard is significantly slower than a Qualcomm chipet.6. No fingerprint scannerFirmware is up to date with the latest software as of 10/22/2016:BUILD: 36.0.A.2.109Model F32131/5 star rating until Sony fixes the MANY MAJOR issues.UPDATE: Sony released a firmware update, and I have updated above the latest firmware for this handset. The phone STILL has ALL of the issues above, AND now has worse battery life. This phone is really a piece of crap. The only thing making me keep it is how cheap it is for the size of the screen.UPDATE 2: Sony Customer support is absolutely TERRIBLE. I have tried communicating with them in numerous ways and multiple attempts, and they have no clue how to go off script to help. Their solution is sto send in my unit (I've gone through a few replacements at this point, so it's not the ""unit"", it's piss poor engineering and software support.UPDATE 3: The phone is noticiably slower and gettigng very sluggish with only 3 weeks of use so far. Unbelievable."
"391958","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB White (US Warranty)",3,"Bad vibration"
"391959","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB White (US Warranty)",5,"Okay! I have to say that I love this phone it's just the cat's meow nice big screen lots of great features inmates calls with no problem. There's a lot of reviews that are pre software update about LTE problems which have been addressed they've upgraded the software so the battery last longer. I don't get me wrong it's still not the longest lasting battery but you get about what you get with your other phones like the Samsung Galaxy and many of the other phones. Huawei has this hands down as does Apple from what I understand. Not much I can say bad about this phone few times the speaker has locked up on me and is not heard me when I was answering calls for asking Google a question. I rebooted a couple times and it's fine. It may turn out to be a problem although after the reboot it's been fine as I said. For the price I don't know that you can do much better it's a really good phone."
"391960","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB White (US Warranty)",5,"I would give this a 10 star rating people be sleeping on this phone right here I bought it because of the camera and screen size. Yes I understand it's Apple & Samsung taking the market but this is way cheaper than both the iPhone and Galaxy's, and does a lot more too. Wake up people, this phone legit and unlocked too. Yes it works with T-mobile and at&t. Like what Donald Trump says, WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO LOSE?"

They forgot to send me the SIM and SD card but they refunded $72 for me to get it on my own. It really is a cool phone I have nothing else to say, definitely better than the Iphone 6s and definitely better than Samsung. Front camera is amazing, email is amazing, downloads and everything are smooth and fast, the bigger screen lets me not have to squint at my phone all day. I have the white version. I mean yeah the battery doesnt last long but at least it doesnt die at 8% when you're on the phone, it actually stays until the 1%."
"391963","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB White (US Warranty)",4,"For the price you pay, this phone is great. It's not a flagship there could be some improvements. The camera is great, but with night pics you have to learn how to play with the settings to take great pics. The music player is good, the sound from its speaker is very clear and loud."
"391964","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB White (US Warranty)",4,"I was a iPhone 5 user, and during my trip to China this summer I used Samsung J3 and later I switched to a Sony M4 Aqua (Hongkong version, dual SIM card), that's how I started to play with Android and Sony stuff.The feeling this XA Ultra is terrific! At least my own experience on communication and light app use are good enough. Watching movie is an enjoy. But sorry I don't take photos/selfies very often, so no comments on it :-)Good news for bug fix:At least on my side, AT&T's problem is now solved. Switching between HSPA (H or H+) and LTE is smooth and not problem was detected.Maybe a bug, but might be a good thing:Battery life is scolded by a lot of users. This is not a problem for me since I often sit in offices, or commute in my car.Actually I found another problem: charging is extremely slow (or even negative, loss of percentage) with some old USB cables (I am using Amazon Basics charger and Kindle's cable). It can be a bug, or maybe it's a security concern from SONY that old or unverified chargers should be limitied.In Android 6.0.1 on other X phones there are soft charging which makes charging slower). No one wants another Samsung Note 7 incident right?BTW, charging on my car (Amazon Basics USB outlet and AB's cable is still on the normal speed as the original SONY charging kit coming with the phone.Bad thing - that's why I removed one star:Storage. SONY insist on a 16GB and no more upgrade is available. (even for the recent XZ and X Compact, they stick to 32G and no more upgrade option available).Also, Android 6.0 has a ""Format as Internal Storage"" feature which allows cellphone to treat external SD card as internal storage. I know it will sacrifice the performance because the external cards are slower, but SONY just blocks it. I know SONY wants to make sure that we can experience smooth performance. But I am not happy with that. I think SONY can provide a warning before customers eventually turns on the feature. Do not follow Apple who confines users in the name of ""so-called"" user experience."

"391966","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB White (US Warranty)",3,"I'm quite disappointed with this phone, and I've had it for a week. I'm starting to think that the Gold Lime (a.k.a. Lemon) color is a warning...but these are not issues with this unit. This model, which has so much potential, simply does not have its potential filled. GPS? unreliable. Not by much, but enough to miss a turn here and there. No tap to wake up or lock phone, which is a feature that should be in every Android 6 phone. Turn off screen with case? Not implemented yet, even though Sony sells (in the UK) a case that does that. Security update of May 1st (there have been three updates since then, and this is a new device!). These are all software issues, that should have been taken care of already (there was a software update). I hope that the promised update to Android 7 will be quick and solve these issues.Battery life? Two days, of calls, texts and very limited web access. Use Google Maps, and you will see drain of 20% in an hour. Pokemon Go will drain the battery in an hour or so, and constantly complains about losing GPS and internet (which it then reacquires in a few seconds).Internal storage of 16GB should have been fine with the additional microSD, if only Sony would have allowed its apps to be removed (or at least moved to the card) and the big cache users put their caches on the card. As it currently stands, my phone has 3GB free and I need to be careful of which apps to install. Should have beed 32GB.I have not used the cameras much, so I cannot really say anything about them that other reviews .On the bright side, the screen is beautiful, and the phone very narrow (relative to other 5.5"" and 6"" phones), which makes it easy to hold and use."

"391973","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB White (US Warranty)",4,"This is a review comparing this phone to the HTC Desire Eye, on Android 6.0 Marshmallow.I got this phone with the Sony MicroSD 64GB deal for $306 ish after tax & free one-day shipping. Amazon told me I'd get it by the 15th, but it literally came next day, so hands off to you, Amazon.Screen : yes, it is extremely bigger than the HTC, by a whole .8 inches; the keyboard felt so much better on the Xperia XA Ultra, but that's just because my fingers had the space to press the right key. BUT quality wise, I was not impressed when I had my HTC right next to the Xperia. Fooled me, my HTC had a brighter and more clear colorful screen, even with the stock Xperia wallpaper applied.Camera : Oh boy, I was sad the minute it was opened. Colors were washed out in normal sunlit rooms, no way to save preferred options on top of the Superior Auto, and biggest difference between the HTC stock camera was the selfie front camera had no way to beautify in-app. I would have to download a separate app ): Nor was the front camera even clear; the focus on my HTC was superior. This was the deal breaker for me.Speed : Camera shutter speed was the same, camera start up speed was the same, picture processing after capture is slower on xperia, opening apps on the same wifi network was the same, opening apps on data plan was same, download speeds the same wifi and data wise, start up from power down was slower on the Xperia.Interface : Though I am used to HTC Sense Home layout, the Sony UI was not hard to navigate through, I found everything I needed quick or with some fast reading. I mean, the Sony one stuck with the notification drop down menu from vanilla Android, which was a nice difference to look at. But HTC could fit and has more options for the settings in the drop down, such as an extra row at the bottom for 12 options rather than just 9. You'd think you can fit more on a bigger screen, but Sony just didn't program it to utilize it that way. Shrugs.Two software updates straight out of the box, though the first was a quick update, but the second took a little longer to boot.Is okay, slight overheat in first start up and set up, but that's normal for any phone. But my concern is that the heat was above in the top right corner where the camera ans not where your hand usually holds the phone, so if it does overheat again, how would you know... ):No gyroscope, so don't believe that one answer on BestBuy's product page. (This means Pokemon Go suffers, & my HTC has gyro, shrugs.)Did not come with adaptive storage enabled, so I would have to program it to do so, when my HTC just required a fast enough SD to do so (UHS-3 minimum, which is not cheap, but least likely to give me hiccups).Vibration was extremely easy to feel, which was pleasant, because it was strong enough to feel, but not too strong that the phone moves on a table surface.Speakers are at the bottom, but I still heard it. My HTC has front facing speakers, so I cannot compare effectively, since front facing is already a bias.Other than that, I didn't really test anything else.Nothing on battery life, GPS, phone clarity.. Please ask any questions you have, as I will probably be able to tell you directly from my short time with it.Yes, I did return it. (:"

The phone had no problem connecting to the network once the sim card was inserted but it takes for ever to initiate the call. After dialing a number or selecting a contact to call it takes a good 10-20 seconds for the dial tone to start. These calls are made in a major city and I have never had this problem with other cell phones.Coming from a note 5, the screen quality isn't the best.

If you hit it by finger, you can feel gap between this back and battery.Battery life is really bad, put there 1 night, 20% battery drop. To get fast charging, you need to purchase extra charger.Screen is OK, but SONY font has issue for Japanese and Tradition Chinese. This is a hardware issue I think, the font database is inside a chip.Not sure if I should keep this phone.For my understand, this phone should be at price of $199 - $239, instead of $329.Consider return this phone and upgrade to XA Performance."
"391981","Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB White (US Warranty)",5,"It's a large phone but deceptively light. Charges fast and the battery holds that charge for over a day (best I got thus far is 55 hours of charge). Sets up fast and simple (you don't need to be super hone savvy to set up). Camera is the best - both the main camera and the selfie camera. Pics are super clear and the options for your pics are pretty varied. Just remember to purchase a MicroSD card with it - the small size of memory will disappear quickly once you start loading apps & taking pics/video."

Sometimes the WiFi won't connect even though there is Wi-Fi present. The solution to this is to restart your phone. This could be cumbersome to some. Not all of the phones have this issue but it's not just my phone that had this issue. You're playing Russian Roulette trying to get one that doesn't. The phone also Response a little slow sometimes when you try to turn the screen on. Nothing major. It really isn't that bad. Lastly, snapchat doesn't use the camera to its full potential. The camera is great. I love it and have no problems with it. I just feel that the quality of snapchat pictures aren't on par with pictures you take with the regular camera app. Just the issue I have with the phone. It would be nice to have more memory. 16 GB isn't good enough when the phone takes more than half of it to function. You can buy a memory card to expand it which is great. Overall I am still pretty happy with this phone. Not a bad product considering the price you get it for. If anyone has any questions I did not answer contact me and I will be happy to help."

At first I wasn't looking for a flagship phone or something super high tech I just needed something that worked. When I purchased the phone I knew what I was getting I checked out the specs and everything. When it arrived I was excited to get it set up and ready for use. After Updating the phone I realized that I only had 5 gigabytes left of internal phone storage which I thought was ridiculous. So there was over 10 GIGS OF UPDATES!!!! Absolutely Ridiculous. I really liked the size of the phone but that was really the only thing that stood out as far as appearance goes but lacked a finger print scanner and other features that most phones have now a days especially for this price. I really recommend looking elsewhere for a phone with better features and that is more up to date than the XA Ultra. Overall its just a really mediocre phone."

"392158","Sony Xperia XZ - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Forest Blue (US Warranty)",5,"Sleek and beautiful in forest blue. Eveything a phone should be. Excellent feel. Great cameras. Easy set-up on AT&T. Great Sony extras include convenient audio settings, built in noise reduction for Sony headphones, Smart Connect to program behavior when external device is connected, and motion gesture settings for phone answering, ring stopping, send call to voice mail. Had a Z2 before this. Sony has the best premium devices on the market."
"392159","Sony Xperia XZ - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Forest Blue (US Warranty)",4,"But coming from an Xperia Z to an XZ it's almost the same just a step up. Better battery, runs faster and smoother, and not to mention a slightly bigger but way brighter screen."
"392160","Sony Xperia XZ - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Forest Blue (US Warranty)",5,"I've had this phone for a number of weeks now and am very pleased overall.When I was looking to buy a new phone I was comparing this one specifically to Google's Pixel. Some of my initial concerns were getting updates timely, durability, and price.The hardware is standard for 2016 phones. The Pixel has a slightly newer processor that's negligibly faster. It was a disappointment the XZ only had 3GB of RAM though. This was still an upgrade from my previous phone however. There's also 1 very important fact to keep in mind when buying the latest and greatest in processing power - battery life. The Pixel had a beefier (ever so slightly) processor, and yet a smaller battery. Battery life will take a hit because of that. I was much less worried about it with this phone. The XZ (in the US) doesn't have a fingerprint sensor which is a bummer but I'm not going to miss it. The camera IS as high quality as Sony claims. I love it and can get off 10+ pictures without slow down.One of the reasons I was looking into the Pixel was because it would be nice to have a pure android phone. Samsung phones have that god-awful TouchWiz business and Sony's have the Xperia UI. You also have to wait for updates. I'm currently still waiting for Android 7.0 which I'm getting impatient for. The one thing I like about the Xperia is the customizability. Everyone Oo's and Awe's when they see my phone because the menus, buttons, etc all look extremely different from a normal android and they're surprised to find out I haven't rooted it.Some features this phone has that I couldn't get with Google's.Waterproofing - This was HUGE for me. I don't go around getting my phones wet however I have dropped one in the toilet before. That slip-up will destroy non-waterproof phonesSD card slot - If the phone has 64GB of internal memory or more it's not an issue. Unfortunately to get that with the Pixel it massively hiked the price. Beyond what this phone cost.Front facing speakers - This was also a big deal for me. I listen to music quietly in the mornings when getting ready and can't wear headphones while doing it. I hate the way sound comes out muffled when the speakers are pointed somewhere else.In the end I decided I could live with the Xperia interface, one gig less of RAM and slow updates. I like the way this phone looks. It's unique. Sony goes the opposite direction of simply copying Apple like Google did with the Pixel. Anything hardware-wise the Pixel had over the XZ, this phone beat with additional features (like the waterproofing). I feel like for the money I'd rather buy those features than a sliver of improvement in hardware."
"392161","Sony Xperia XZ - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Forest Blue (US Warranty)",5,"A much more sleek feel in the hands compared to the Z3. A step in the right direction for the xperia line. The reception I get using TMobiles network is great."

"392163","Sony Xperia XZ - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Forest Blue (US Warranty)",3,"The Xperia XZ is truly a beautiful device. While the ""slab"" appearance my turn some people off, it's very comfortable to hold, and is narrow enough that it never feels like it's about to fly from your hand. The display, while not mind-boggling in terms of specs, borrows heavily from Sony's television expertise, and looks more ""natural"" playing HD movies than the iPhone 7 Plus and Galaxy S7 Edge.Sound quality, while maybe not quite to BoomSound's bar on earlier HTC devices, is also surprisingly good. It may not be the ""best"" Android device I've used for media consumption, but its the most enjoyable.Signal quality is something of a mixed bag. In places where other phones have marginal LTE coverage, I noticed the Xperia would drop to 3G more often than not. In places with stronger LTE coverage, I was seeing results like this when comparing with the same SIM:OnePlus 3: 32mb down / 8mb upGalaxy S7 Edge: 33mb down / 8mb upiPhone 7 Plus: 35 down / 7mb upXperia XZ: 27 down / 4mb up(Tests were run multiple times, and results are rounded and averaged.)The digitizer is nice and accurate, with almost perfect sensitivity. And throughout the device, there are numerous design cues that took me back to the Clie series of PDA's back in the long-long-ago. Even the no-needle-necessary SIM/SD tray is a welcome addition. You really do get a sense that this phone is ""expensive"" and attention was paid to every detail.Except one.This should all point to a higher rating, but the disappointing and deal-breaking discovery for me is that Sony chose to disable adoptable storage (at the time of this writing, there's not very extensive coverage of the phone, so this may be a more obvious deficiency in the future). I knew out of the gate that this only has 32GB, but with the inclusion of MicroSD support and every other ""nice"" feature of the phone seems to imply that it would just be there. It isn't, and enabling it over ADB doesn't work. So out of the box, with only software updates to the preinstalled apps and two weeks worth of my GMail account, 40% of the internal storage was already spoken for.While that might be acceptable for many, the second shoe dropped when it came to using the SD card as a media repository. Playback of Sony's own demo movies from the card (A Class 10 SanDisk Ultra) were choppy, and the transfer speed was dramatically slower than in my S7 Edge. My guess here is for whatever reason, Sony decided to go cheap here.And that, sadly, is why I'll be returning the phone. Were it not for that awful decision, it would be hands-down the best Android device I've used."
"392164","Sony Xperia XZ - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Forest Blue (US Warranty)",5,"Lovely phone, silky smooth operation, photos look great. Could not be happier. Getting a better TMobile signal strength than my previous Sony Xperia Z5 for some reason, more signal bars in a given geographic area. I forgot to call TMobile to update new phone IMEI number and it disconnected from network after a while. I just called to update them with new phone info and it works like a champ again. Oh yeah- no bloatware.There is no other phone I'd want to own. Period."
"392165","Sony Xperia XZ - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Forest Blue (US Warranty)",2,"Camera is not good as it says it is, my main reason of purchasing it was the ""beautiful 23mpx camera"". Galaxy s7 does a lot better job with 12mpx than this xz, very disappointed, the sd card slot didn't read the sd card after a day, the camera started glitching. As I said very very disappointed with this phone. Hope Sony will do better next time.And also the phone came in very weird box, looked like it was used item. Not like iPhone sealed box. Didn't liked it."

If you previously held a lollipop, the permissions are going to get you on your nerves but you can manage itQuiet expensive but considering it is a new phone, it is almost worth the priceHow you can get the fingerprint scanner? You can buy an international version which I didn't find convenient or you can follow this [...]The fingerprint scanner is a software limitation only and you can flash it to get the fingerprint enabled, same way as I did with the UK version. Does it void your warranty? Only if you root it and UNLOCK the bootloader of the phone. Flashing a sotware is like installing and update, but unlocking the bootloader is not and you don't have to do it to get the fingerprint scannerIn general, it is a good phone and if you think that you need t buy an international version only to get the scanner you might be wrong"

"392171","Sony Xperia XZ - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Forest Blue (US Warranty)",5,"I haven’t purchased a Sony Xperia since the original Z, and though I longed for that clicking-on-glass touch sound effect, there was always something that held me back about the models before now. The tech reviews are always harsh on Xperias, but let me tell you, Sony is at the top of their game with the XZ. No other phone feels quite like an Xperia and this one feels the absolute best, by far. The forest blue version has a chameleon effect, looking black one minute, blue the other and purple the next. And the matte metal finish on the back and the curved-edge loop design give it an unparalleled luxurious finish. Size is perfect and the whole thing is surprisingly lightweight. Camera takes fantastic photos, both in daylight and low light and the AR effects are a blast to play with. Performance has been buttery smooth, even after the 7.0 Nougat update. Not worried enough about the lack of fingerprint sensor to flash it with the European software and mess with my warranty. It’s perfect exactly the way it is. It feels just great to be back with the Xperia family."

Of the 32GB storage nearly 11GB of OS and 2GB of programs that I don't use and can not remove.

"392179","Sony Xperia XZ - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Forest Blue (US Warranty)",5,"This review is for the Sony Xperia XZ. To start, I'm running T-Mobile here in the northeast. Also, we have other Xperia phones (Z Ultra, Z3 and Z5), and this is replacing a Samsung Galaxy S7, as my patience with Samsung and Apple is exhausted. (My wife has always had Samsungs and even she was getting ticked off) First, I'm 100% convinced that so called ""Experts"" who review phones are being paid by the phone manufacturers, and I'll explain. Take screen resolution. They complain that a particular phone is weak based on specs. Never mind that your eye can't tell the difference between 720p and 1080p with screen sizes less than 46"", any 5"" phone that doesn't have 1080p is committing the ultimate sin in the view, as long as it's not Apple. For me, the order of importance in a phone is the following (starting with the most important): A) It should be able to get a good signal from a cell tower. B) The WiFi should work well and be stable C) The camera should take nice quality pictures. D) It should be snappy and respond quickly E) The build quality of the device and display.My wife has the S7. Wherever we traveled, she'd hit weak spots and lose connectivity, while those of us with the Sony phones never have issues (she has had issues in the heart of Manhattan, while I'm getting 5 bars with my old Ultra). At home, I have 3 access points, and the channels are spread out. All the Sony phones have no issues switching from one AP to another, while the Samsung would lose it's mind. The Cameras are equivalent (edge to Sony), the Samsung has a nicer display, but the build and feel of the XZ is just at another level. As the older Xperias Z's are superior to any of the Samsungs, the new XZ is magnitudes better (there is just no comparison).and that's why I brought up the issue of ""professional"" reviews. This phone makes the previous Xperias look cheap and they are great phones in and of themselves. How Sony is not dominating the market is beyond me. I don't know much about the LG and HTC phones, but having owned an iPhone and various Samsung Galaxy phones, they can't hold a candle compared to this new XZ"
"392180","Sony Xperia XZ - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Forest Blue (US Warranty)",4,"I love the color, I traded my note 7 for this. I got it for the camera specifically. I love playing my ps4 on this while my gf uses the TV."
"392181","Sony Xperia XZ - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Forest Blue (US Warranty)",3,"The phone deserved 5 starsThe reason that I gave 3 is missing the headphones, I called C.S and they said it doesn't come with headphones, so I made a separate order for that."

"392185","Sony Xperia XZ - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Forest Blue (US Warranty)",1,"I advise all not to get this phone it's like an egg if you drop it all your money going to drain 😤"
"392186","Sony Xperia XZ - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Forest Blue (US Warranty)",4,"I'm coming from an iPhone 6s and have really enjoyed the phone. Especially if you have a PS4 at home, the remote play feature is really fun. Pretty neat to access your PS4 all across the house. The rounded edge makes the phone really comfortable to hold, and is easy to reach all areas of the phone. Great camera, overall phone feels quick and responsive. However I do want to make any potential US buyers aware. I am on the AT&T network and am unable to access their LTE network. After hours of troubleshooting with AT&T and on my own, many different APN settings, I have discovered the issue. Because it is a non AT&T phone they aren't likely to help you, but if you can get them to set your account an AT&T IMEI number, a demo phone maybe, or you could purchase a cheap LTE go phone, you could have it work then. You are simply tricking their network to think you are on an AT&T phone. I've had a lot of frustration so hope I can help out someone here. As I said, overall I have really enjoyed the phone, but wanted to make people aware of the LTE issue with AT&T."
"392187","Sony Xperia XZ - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Forest Blue (US Warranty)",5,"My first Xperia since the X1, and it's a great phone to use on a daily basis. Great build quality, sleek design, and it feels great in my hands. Some would complain the edges are too ""sharp"" or rectangular, but this design stands out from the rest of the rounded rectangular phones. For 1080p, the display is very nice. Although it's not the best, the camera good enough for social media snaps. The stereo speakers are cool, but it's pretty weak. The LED flash is weak. There's hardly any bloat compared to other brands or carrier phones, so it's very smooth with great battery life. Due to its sleek design with Snapdragon 820, it can overheat (with warning) from heavy usage especially when hot spot is enabled. I'm not a heavy user anyway. My last phones were Note 4 and 7, and I've given up on that brand for now."
"392188","Sony Xperia XZ - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Forest Blue (US Warranty)",5,"Very good phone."
"392189","Sony Xperia XZ - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Forest Blue (US Warranty)",5,"one of the best phones in the market. price is little bit high rite now. if you can wait for couple of months there will be a price drop. if u can get this phone around $500-550. it will be a great deal."
"392190","Sony Xperia XZ - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Forest Blue (US Warranty)",5,"I intensively used the phone since I've got it, just to make sure there are no surprises...and there aren't! Awesome unit, top notch screen, clean Android experience from a trusted brand. Fast and fluid operation, not one single hiccup. Improved LTE signal strength on t-mobile, very good call quality. Overall, happy with what I've got (don't care about missing the fingerprint scanner or other ""goodies"", I knew what i am getting before I placed my order) and the price looks right to me. I just added recently the Cover Touch Case SCTF10, looks and feels great, good job Sony!"
"392191","Sony Xperia XZ - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Forest Blue (US Warranty)",5,"I always been a Sony fan boy as many would probably say but is because I have never had issues with Sony cellphones, I used a Z2 for about three years and after probably 20 drops and charging it every night it kept working like a stallion. Now with the XZ I'm very happy with it, I don't have to worry about having low memory, water or dust proof, been dropped, catching fire, headphone jack etc.... Sony has always been ahead of the game for me but since is not popular over here in the states I guess not many buy it. I was going to switch to Samsung and get me that Note 7 but we all know what happen, I was also thinking Apple again but those guys are a bit late on many thing and I don't have the freedom like I do with android."
"392192","Sony Xperia XZ - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Forest Blue (US Warranty)",4,"The phone is a beauty; it runs very fast and smooth. I had no problem connecting to the network and WiFi, LTE is blazingly fast, applications load in a snap. Call sound quality is very good; music quality while using earphones is very decent. The phone is easily customizable, no problem with that. Well, I still like Windows Phone, that I used for almost six years, better than Android, but it's my problem, not Sony Xperia's. :)There is one huge disappointment, it's the camera. Despite having 23 mp it's no match for my old Lumia 930, especially in low light conditions. It's a shame that Sony still could not fix camera software problems, despite being pointed to that direction by many professional reviewers not only of this phone, but the whole Xperia X series."

"392195","Sony Xperia XZ - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Forest Blue (US Warranty)",5,"Beautiful design. Feels expensive and good in the hand, not too big not too small but of course is is relative as we all have difference size hands.Amazing screen! The colors are rich and vibrant when using it, viewing pics, or watching videos.Powerful! It flew threw setup and installing my last Android backup in record time. Also it updated to Nougat while I was setting it up for the first time, so the latest Android OS right from the start was a great bonus!Yes the international version is 64GB of internal memory vs the US's 32, but with up to 256 MicroSD expandable memory, that's not really an issue. Plus not all US carriers provide full bandwidth support for the international version (i.e. you might not get LTE, only 4G) so do your research before buying based on specs alone.Price is right compared to other phones on the market, i.e. the new Google Pixel. I had already pre-ordered my XZ but watched the Pixel announcement and really liked what they are finally doing, but also had some concerns: 1) it's first gen tech. Google is an amazing company but i've been burned before and make it a point to never buy 'the first' of any new tech that's released. 2) it's expensive! if you get the big 128GB model and the insurance it's going to sent you back just under $900 bucks. That's asking a lot for a smartphone, even one that's 100% Google made. So when i looked at the two, i stuck with my XZ and couldn't be happier.And battery life has been really good. Using it all day (8AM to 9PM) without charging and still have 30-40% juice left. Mine came with Sony's rapid charging wall-plug, and I bought some Anker 3.0 USB-C cables (bought through Amazon of course ^_^), so she charges very quickly. I think in under 10 minutes I went from under 50% battery life to 100%.I'm not a tech professional by any means, I'm just your average consumer that's tech savvy and values my dollars going to quality products that I'll get at least 2-3 years solid use out. Yes, there are other Android phones on the market with bigger/better technical specs, but not everything needs to be 100% top-end. If you do that you get crap battery life because that bigger processor and better screen and finger print scanner and all those other 'nice to haves' need juice to run. The more you tack on, the harder the phone has to work, the hotter it runs and the crappier the battery life is. So I'm happy with the Sony XZ because it takes advantage of everything I want in a premium phone, has high-end specs that work in its beautiful design, and they made it so it works as hard without over doing it.All in all it's one of the best Android phones I've ever used, and I've used all the majors (Samsung, Motorola, and HTC) and none of them compare to this. I only hope it sells well so that Sony further invests in the US market because we've been waiting for high-end Android phones like the XZ for years."
"392196","Sony Xperia XZ - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Forest Blue (US Warranty)",5,"This phone is a powerhouse, I owned the z3, z3+ and now the XZ and I gotta say this is the best I've seen since the super reliable z3 and the battery life is comparable if not better then the Z3 and for those of you that don't know the battery on the Z3 was outstanding. The display on the XZ is unbelievably clear, it's very well made, love the design, it's ridiculously fast like the absolute fastest camera and shutter I have ever seen on a smartphone. Auto focus is unreal and camera app opens instantly (huge improvement of past Sonys). Highly recommend"
"392197","Sony Xperia XZ - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Forest Blue (US Warranty)",5,"Color - Mineral BlackI am transitioning from Oneplus 3 to Xperia XZ. I am satisfied with the performance my current phone but I am making this shift to XZ only for the design aspect and camera. I have been waiting so long for Sony to release an all rounder phone that can compete with other flagships in the market and this time they nailed it.Pros:Performance: Crisp and fast without any lag.Design: IMO, this is the best looking handset among the current flagships(including iphone 7 and pixel). It's been 3 days since I started using it, and it had already drawn attention from my friends. In one word it will put all the flagships to shame. Thumbs up for the mineral black color.Camera: Manual mode is a killer. Auto focus and video quality is also good. Indoor and low light shots are great if you can tweak little bit in the manual mode.Fingerprint sensor: If you can spend some time and flash the software with UK version, then you will probably unearth one of the amazing and effective finger print sensors in the market. It seems to respond faster than iphone6s, iphone 7 and oneplus 3.Display: Nothing to complain.Speakers: Dual speaker are really cool.SD Card: Not yet installed a micro sd card. So could not comment on that yet.Water proof: Have not tested and no intentions to do it.Cons:Battery: Its just satisfactory. I use my phone quite a bit during day(at least 2 hour talk time, 3 hours of listening music, 1 hour of bluetooth streaming in the car, 2 hours of browsing, social networking and video streaming combined). An extra 10% could have been better in my case.Wish list:Charging Time: Oneplus3 and Pixel has fast charge option that can charge 60% of the phone in 30 mins. I miss that feature in Xperia XZ. It usually takes 60 minutes for 60% charge.Overall: Sony has finally hit the cord by packing all the best and cool features into one single handset XZ. Be it camera, display, performance, fingerprint sensor or dual speakers it perfected each of those features. Price wise it is on the higher end of the spectrum competing with Samsung and Apple. Sony is a premium brand which uses finest materials. It is perceived as an upscale brand even before apple started working on it's ipods. At the same time I would not waste money if they deliver incompetent products(which is the case of some of their earlier xperias).But if a Sony product can compete with Samsung and Apple then I would not mind paying the premium. If you don't want to be one in millions using Iphones and Samsungs and yet do not compromise on quality and performance then the answer is ""Own an Xperia XZ""."

However, today I'm comparing it with the Google Pixel, which is $50 cheaper.

I knew out of the gate that this only has 32GB, but with the inclusion of MicroSD support and every other ""nice"" feature of the phone seems to imply that it would just be there. It isn't, and enabling it over ADB doesn't work. So out of the box, with only software updates to the preinstalled apps and two weeks worth of my GMail account, 40% of the internal storage was already spoken for.While that might be acceptable for many, the second shoe dropped when it came to using the SD card as a media repository. Playback of Sony's own demo movies from the card (A Class 10 SanDisk Ultra) were choppy, and the transfer speed was dramatically slower than in my S7 Edge. My guess here is for whatever reason, Sony decided to go cheap here.And that, sadly, is why I'll be returning the phone. Were it not for that awful decision, it would be hands-down the best Android device I've used."

The tech reviews are always harsh on Xperias, but let me tell you, Sony is at the top of their game with the XZ. No other phone feels quite like an Xperia and this one feels the absolute best, by far. The forest blue version has a chameleon effect, looking black one minute, blue the other and purple the next. And the matte metal finish on the back and the curved-edge loop design give it an unparalleled luxurious finish. Size is perfect and the whole thing is surprisingly lightweight. Camera takes fantastic photos, both in daylight and low light and the AR effects are a blast to play with. Performance has been buttery smooth, even after the 7.0 Nougat update. Not worried enough about the lack of fingerprint sensor to flash it with the European software and mess with my warranty. It’s perfect exactly the way it is.

Especially if you have a PS4 at home, the remote play feature is really fun. Pretty neat to access your PS4 all across the house. The rounded edge makes the phone really comfortable to hold, and is easy to reach all areas of the phone. Great camera, overall phone feels quick and responsive. However I do want to make any potential US buyers aware. I am on the AT&T network and am unable to access their LTE network. After hours of troubleshooting with AT&T and on my own, many different APN settings, I have discovered the issue. Because it is a non AT&T phone they aren't likely to help you, but if you can get them to set your account an AT&T IMEI number, a demo phone maybe, or you could purchase a cheap LTE go phone, you could have it work then. You are simply tricking their network to think you are on an AT&T phone. I've had a lot of frustration so hope I can help out someone here. As I said, overall I have really enjoyed the phone, but wanted to make people aware of the LTE issue with AT&T."
"392221","Sony Xperia XZ - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Mineral Black (US Warranty)",5,"My first Xperia since the X1, and it's a great phone to use on a daily basis. Great build quality, sleek design, and it feels great in my hands. Some would complain the edges are too ""sharp"" or rectangular, but this design stands out from the rest of the rounded rectangular phones. For 1080p, the display is very nice. Although it's not the best, the camera good enough for social media snaps. The stereo speakers are cool, but it's pretty weak. The LED flash is weak. There's hardly any bloat compared to other brands or carrier phones, so it's very smooth with great battery life. Due to its sleek design with Snapdragon 820, it can overheat (with warning) from heavy usage especially when hot spot is enabled. I'm not a heavy user anyway. My last phones were Note 4 and 7, and I've given up on that brand for now."

"392230","Sony Xperia XZ - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Mineral Black (US Warranty)",5,"I've had this phone for a number of weeks now and am very pleased overall.When I was looking to buy a new phone I was comparing this one specifically to Google's Pixel. Some of my initial concerns were getting updates timely, durability, and price.The hardware is standard for 2016 phones. The Pixel has a slightly newer processor that's negligibly faster. It was a disappointment the XZ only had 3GB of RAM though. This was still an upgrade from my previous phone however. There's also 1 very important fact to keep in mind when buying the latest and greatest in processing power - battery life. The Pixel had a beefier (ever so slightly) processor, and yet a smaller battery. Battery life will take a hit because of that. I was much less worried about it with this phone. The XZ (in the US) doesn't have a fingerprint sensor which is a bummer but I'm not going to miss it. The camera IS as high quality as Sony claims. I love it and can get off 10+ pictures without slow down.One of the reasons I was looking into the Pixel was because it would be nice to have a pure android phone. Samsung phones have that god-awful TouchWiz business and Sony's have the Xperia UI. You also have to wait for updates. I'm currently still waiting for Android 7.0 which I'm getting impatient for. The one thing I like about the Xperia is the customizability. Everyone Oo's and Awe's when they see my phone because the menus, buttons, etc all look extremely different from a normal android and they're surprised to find out I haven't rooted it.Some features this phone has that I couldn't get with Google's.Waterproofing - This was HUGE for me. I don't go around getting my phones wet however I have dropped one in the toilet before. That slip-up will destroy non-waterproof phonesSD card slot - If the phone has 64GB of internal memory or more it's not an issue. Unfortunately to get that with the Pixel it massively hiked the price. Beyond what this phone cost.Front facing speakers - This was also a big deal for me. I listen to music quietly in the mornings when getting ready and can't wear headphones while doing it. I hate the way sound comes out muffled when the speakers are pointed somewhere else.In the end I decided I could live with the Xperia interface, one gig less of RAM and slow updates. I like the way this phone looks. It's unique. Sony goes the opposite direction of simply copying Apple like Google did with the Pixel. Anything hardware-wise the Pixel had over the XZ, this phone beat with additional features (like the waterproofing). I feel like for the money I'd rather buy those features than a sliver of improvement in hardware."
"392231","Sony Xperia XZ - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Mineral Black (US Warranty)",5,"A much more sleek feel in the hands compared to the Z3. A step in the right direction for the xperia line. The reception I get using TMobiles network is great."

"392235","Sony Xperia XZ - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Mineral Black (US Warranty)",5,"I always been a Sony fan boy as many would probably say but is because I have never had issues with Sony cellphones, I used a Z2 for about three years and after probably 20 drops and charging it every night it kept working like a stallion. Now with the XZ I'm very happy with it, I don't have to worry about having low memory, water or dust proof, been dropped, catching fire, headphone jack etc.... Sony has always been ahead of the game for me but since is not popular over here in the states I guess not many buy it. I was going to switch to Samsung and get me that Note 7 but we all know what happen, I was also thinking Apple again but those guys are a bit late on many thing and I don't have the freedom like I do with android."
"392236","Sony Xperia XZ - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Mineral Black (US Warranty)",4,"The phone is a beauty; it runs very fast and smooth. I had no problem connecting to the network and WiFi, LTE is blazingly fast, applications load in a snap. Call sound quality is very good; music quality while using earphones is very decent. The phone is easily customizable, no problem with that. Well, I still like Windows Phone, that I used for almost six years, better than Android, but it's my problem, not Sony Xperia's. :)There is one huge disappointment, it's the camera. Despite having 23 mp it's no match for my old Lumia 930, especially in low light conditions. It's a shame that Sony still could not fix camera software problems, despite being pointed to that direction by many professional reviewers not only of this phone, but the whole Xperia X series."

"392239","Sony Xperia XZ - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Mineral Black (US Warranty)",5,"Beautiful design. Feels expensive and good in the hand, not too big not too small but of course is is relative as we all have difference size hands.Amazing screen! The colors are rich and vibrant when using it, viewing pics, or watching videos.Powerful! It flew threw setup and installing my last Android backup in record time. Also it updated to Nougat while I was setting it up for the first time, so the latest Android OS right from the start was a great bonus!Yes the international version is 64GB of internal memory vs the US's 32, but with up to 256 MicroSD expandable memory, that's not really an issue. Plus not all US carriers provide full bandwidth support for the international version (i.e. you might not get LTE, only 4G) so do your research before buying based on specs alone.Price is right compared to other phones on the market, i.e. the new Google Pixel. I had already pre-ordered my XZ but watched the Pixel announcement and really liked what they are finally doing, but also had some concerns: 1) it's first gen tech. Google is an amazing company but i've been burned before and make it a point to never buy 'the first' of any new tech that's released. 2) it's expensive! if you get the big 128GB model and the insurance it's going to sent you back just under $900 bucks. That's asking a lot for a smartphone, even one that's 100% Google made. So when i looked at the two, i stuck with my XZ and couldn't be happier.And battery life has been really good. Using it all day (8AM to 9PM) without charging and still have 30-40% juice left. Mine came with Sony's rapid charging wall-plug, and I bought some Anker 3.0 USB-C cables (bought through Amazon of course ^_^), so she charges very quickly. I think in under 10 minutes I went from under 50% battery life to 100%.I'm not a tech professional by any means, I'm just your average consumer that's tech savvy and values my dollars going to quality products that I'll get at least 2-3 years solid use out. Yes, there are other Android phones on the market with bigger/better technical specs, but not everything needs to be 100% top-end. If you do that you get crap battery life because that bigger processor and better screen and finger print scanner and all those other 'nice to haves' need juice to run. The more you tack on, the harder the phone has to work, the hotter it runs and the crappier the battery life is. So I'm happy with the Sony XZ because it takes advantage of everything I want in a premium phone, has high-end specs that work in its beautiful design, and they made it so it works as hard without over doing it.All in all it's one of the best Android phones I've ever used, and I've used all the majors (Samsung, Motorola, and HTC) and none of them compare to this. I only hope it sells well so that Sony further invests in the US market because we've been waiting for high-end Android phones like the XZ for years."
"392240","Sony Xperia XZ - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Mineral Black (US Warranty)",5,"This phone is a powerhouse, I owned the z3, z3+ and now the XZ and I gotta say this is the best I've seen since the super reliable z3 and the battery life is comparable if not better then the Z3 and for those of you that don't know the battery on the Z3 was outstanding. The display on the XZ is unbelievably clear, it's very well made, love the design, it's ridiculously fast like the absolute fastest camera and shutter I have ever seen on a smartphone. Auto focus is unreal and camera app opens instantly (huge improvement of past Sonys). Highly recommend"
"392241","Sony Xperia XZ - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Mineral Black (US Warranty)",5,"Color - Mineral BlackI am transitioning from Oneplus 3 to Xperia XZ. I am satisfied with the performance my current phone but I am making this shift to XZ only for the design aspect and camera. I have been waiting so long for Sony to release an all rounder phone that can compete with other flagships in the market and this time they nailed it.Pros:Performance: Crisp and fast without any lag.Design: IMO, this is the best looking handset among the current flagships(including iphone 7 and pixel). It's been 3 days since I started using it, and it had already drawn attention from my friends. In one word it will put all the flagships to shame. Thumbs up for the mineral black color.Camera: Manual mode is a killer. Auto focus and video quality is also good. Indoor and low light shots are great if you can tweak little bit in the manual mode.Fingerprint sensor: If you can spend some time and flash the software with UK version, then you will probably unearth one of the amazing and effective finger print sensors in the market. It seems to respond faster than iphone6s, iphone 7 and oneplus 3.Display: Nothing to complain.Speakers: Dual speaker are really cool.SD Card: Not yet installed a micro sd card. So could not comment on that yet.Water proof: Have not tested and no intentions to do it.Cons:Battery: Its just satisfactory. I use my phone quite a bit during day(at least 2 hour talk time, 3 hours of listening music, 1 hour of bluetooth streaming in the car, 2 hours of browsing, social networking and video streaming combined). An extra 10% could have been better in my case.Wish list:Charging Time: Oneplus3 and Pixel has fast charge option that can charge 60% of the phone in 30 mins. I miss that feature in Xperia XZ. It usually takes 60 minutes for 60% charge.Overall: Sony has finally hit the cord by packing all the best and cool features into one single handset XZ. Be it camera, display, performance, fingerprint sensor or dual speakers it perfected each of those features. Price wise it is on the higher end of the spectrum competing with Samsung and Apple. Sony is a premium brand which uses finest materials. It is perceived as an upscale brand even before apple started working on it's ipods. At the same time I would not waste money if they deliver incompetent products(which is the case of some of their earlier xperias).But if a Sony product can compete with Samsung and Apple then I would not mind paying the premium. If you don't want to be one in millions using Iphones and Samsungs and yet do not compromise on quality and performance then the answer is ""Own an Xperia XZ""."
"392242","Sony Xperia XZ - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Mineral Black (US Warranty)",3,"I like to have the latest phones (not necessarily the most expensive.There's a lot to like (very nice screen, good sony-Android skin, good camera, waterproofing, attractive design.)However, the fact that there's no finger print (I don't want to have to flash it,) 3 GB of memory, and snapdragon 820 when the 821 is out, outweighed the good in this phone.I would've kept it 6 months ago if I was deciding between this and the HTC 10. However, today I'm comparing it with the Google Pixel, which is $50 cheaper. I'm going with the Pixel.Hopefully the next Sony flagship will come out in April/May of next year when all other 2017 Android flagships will come out."
"392243","Sony Xperia XZ - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Mineral Black (US Warranty)",3,"The Xperia XZ is truly a beautiful device. While the ""slab"" appearance my turn some people off, it's very comfortable to hold, and is narrow enough that it never feels like it's about to fly from your hand. The display, while not mind-boggling in terms of specs, borrows heavily from Sony's television expertise, and looks more ""natural"" playing HD movies than the iPhone 7 Plus and Galaxy S7 Edge.Sound quality, while maybe not quite to BoomSound's bar on earlier HTC devices, is also surprisingly good. It may not be the ""best"" Android device I've used for media consumption, but its the most enjoyable.Signal quality is something of a mixed bag. In places where other phones have marginal LTE coverage, I noticed the Xperia would drop to 3G more often than not. In places with stronger LTE coverage, I was seeing results like this when comparing with the same SIM:OnePlus 3: 32mb down / 8mb upGalaxy S7 Edge: 33mb down / 8mb upiPhone 7 Plus: 35 down / 7mb upXperia XZ: 27 down / 4mb up(Tests were run multiple times, and results are rounded and averaged.)The digitizer is nice and accurate, with almost perfect sensitivity. And throughout the device, there are numerous design cues that took me back to the Clie series of PDA's back in the long-long-ago. Even the no-needle-necessary SIM/SD tray is a welcome addition.

"392249","Sony Xperia XZ - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Platinum (US Warranty)",3,"fairly disappointed with what i had come to expect from sony. the phone itself is encased in plastic, not metal and a lot easier damaged than their previous xperia phones. the design is strange, with different materials that don't exactly match with each-other. on the ux side the phone is alright, with the exception of ""what's new"" a sony preinstalled app that can't be removed and forces advertisements for stupid games."

Of the 32GB storage nearly 11GB of OS and 2GB of programs that I don't use and can not remove. And I'm very displeased with Sony's ""Whats New"" app that can not be removed or deactivated and constantly pushes adds for other unwanted apps over what I'm doing."

"392255","Sony Xperia XZ - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Platinum (US Warranty)",5,"This review is for the Sony Xperia XZ. To start, I'm running T-Mobile here in the northeast. Also, we have other Xperia phones (Z Ultra, Z3 and Z5), and this is replacing a Samsung Galaxy S7, as my patience with Samsung and Apple is exhausted. (My wife has always had Samsungs and even she was getting ticked off) First, I'm 100% convinced that so called ""Experts"" who review phones are being paid by the phone manufacturers, and I'll explain. Take screen resolution. They complain that a particular phone is weak based on specs. Never mind that your eye can't tell the difference between 720p and 1080p with screen sizes less than 46"", any 5"" phone that doesn't have 1080p is committing the ultimate sin in the view, as long as it's not Apple. For me, the order of importance in a phone is the following (starting with the most important): A) It should be able to get a good signal from a cell tower. B) The WiFi should work well and be stable C) The camera should take nice quality pictures. D) It should be snappy and respond quickly E) The build quality of the device and display.My wife has the S7. Wherever we traveled, she'd hit weak spots and lose connectivity, while those of us with the Sony phones never have issues (she has had issues in the heart of Manhattan, while I'm getting 5 bars with my old Ultra). At home, I have 3 access points, and the channels are spread out. All the Sony phones have no issues switching from one AP to another, while the Samsung would lose it's mind. The Cameras are equivalent (edge to Sony), the Samsung has a nicer display, but the build and feel of the XZ is just at another level. As the older Xperias Z's are superior to any of the Samsungs, the new XZ is magnitudes better (there is just no comparison).and that's why I brought up the issue of ""professional"" reviews. This phone makes the previous Xperias look cheap and they are great phones in and of themselves. How Sony is not dominating the market is beyond me. I don't know much about the LG and HTC phones, but having owned an iPhone and various Samsung Galaxy phones, they can't hold a candle compared to this new XZ"
"392256","Sony Xperia XZ - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Platinum (US Warranty)",4,"I love the color, I traded my note 7 for this. I got it for the camera specifically. I love playing my ps4 on this while my gf uses the TV."
"392257","Sony Xperia XZ - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Platinum (US Warranty)",3,"The phone deserved 5 starsThe reason that I gave 3 is missing the headphones, I called C.S and they said it doesn't come with headphones, so I made a separate order for that."

"392261","Sony Xperia XZ - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Platinum (US Warranty)",1,"I advise all not to get this phone it's like an egg if you drop it all your money going to drain 😤"
"392262","Sony Xperia XZ - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Platinum (US Warranty)",4,"I'm coming from an iPhone 6s and have really enjoyed the phone. Especially if you have a PS4 at home, the remote play feature is really fun. Pretty neat to access your PS4 all across the house. The rounded edge makes the phone really comfortable to hold, and is easy to reach all areas of the phone. Great camera, overall phone feels quick and responsive. However I do want to make any potential US buyers aware. I am on the AT&T network and am unable to access their LTE network. After hours of troubleshooting with AT&T and on my own, many different APN settings, I have discovered the issue. Because it is a non AT&T phone they aren't likely to help you, but if you can get them to set your account an AT&T IMEI number, a demo phone maybe, or you could purchase a cheap LTE go phone, you could have it work then. You are simply tricking their network to think you are on an AT&T phone. I've had a lot of frustration so hope I can help out someone here. As I said, overall I have really enjoyed the phone, but wanted to make people aware of the LTE issue with AT&T."
"392263","Sony Xperia XZ - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Platinum (US Warranty)",5,"My first Xperia since the X1, and it's a great phone to use on a daily basis. Great build quality, sleek design, and it feels great in my hands. Some would complain the edges are too ""sharp"" or rectangular, but this design stands out from the rest of the rounded rectangular phones. For 1080p, the display is very nice. Although it's not the best, the camera good enough for social media snaps. The stereo speakers are cool, but it's pretty weak. The LED flash is weak. There's hardly any bloat compared to other brands or carrier phones, so it's very smooth with great battery life. Due to its sleek design with Snapdragon 820, it can overheat (with warning) from heavy usage especially when hot spot is enabled. I'm not a heavy user anyway. My last phones were Note 4 and 7, and I've given up on that brand for now."
"392264","Sony Xperia XZ - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Platinum (US Warranty)",5,"Very good phone."
"392265","Sony Xperia XZ - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Platinum (US Warranty)",5,"one of the best phones in the market. price is little bit high rite now. if you can wait for couple of months there will be a price drop. if u can get this phone around $500-550. it will be a great deal."
"392266","Sony Xperia XZ - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Platinum (US Warranty)",5,"I intensively used the phone since I've got it, just to make sure there are no surprises...and there aren't! Awesome unit, top notch screen, clean Android experience from a trusted brand. Fast and fluid operation, not one single hiccup. Improved LTE signal strength on t-mobile, very good call quality. Overall, happy with what I've got (don't care about missing the fingerprint scanner or other ""goodies"", I knew what i am getting before I placed my order) and the price looks right to me. I just added recently the Cover Touch Case SCTF10, looks and feels great, good job Sony!"
"392267","Sony Xperia XZ - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Platinum (US Warranty)",5,"I always been a Sony fan boy as many would probably say but is because I have never had issues with Sony cellphones, I used a Z2 for about three years and after probably 20 drops and charging it every night it kept working like a stallion. Now with the XZ I'm very happy with it, I don't have to worry about having low memory, water or dust proof, been dropped, catching fire, headphone jack etc.... Sony has always been ahead of the game for me but since is not popular over here in the states I guess not many buy it. I was going to switch to Samsung and get me that Note 7 but we all know what happen, I was also thinking Apple again but those guys are a bit late on many thing and I don't have the freedom like I do with android."
"392268","Sony Xperia XZ - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Platinum (US Warranty)",4,"The phone is a beauty; it runs very fast and smooth. I had no problem connecting to the network and WiFi, LTE is blazingly fast, applications load in a snap. Call sound quality is very good; music quality while using earphones is very decent. The phone is easily customizable, no problem with that. Well, I still like Windows Phone, that I used for almost six years, better than Android, but it's my problem, not Sony Xperia's. :)There is one huge disappointment, it's the camera. Despite having 23 mp it's no match for my old Lumia 930, especially in low light conditions. It's a shame that Sony still could not fix camera software problems, despite being pointed to that direction by many professional reviewers not only of this phone, but the whole Xperia X series."
"392269","Sony Xperia XZ - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Platinum (US Warranty)",5,"Excellent, very nice, great product, thank you so much"
"392270","Sony Xperia XZ - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Platinum (US Warranty)",1,"El celular no viene con audífonosThe phone did not come with headphones"
"392271","Sony Xperia XZ - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Platinum (US Warranty)",5,"Beautiful design. Feels expensive and good in the hand, not too big not too small but of course is is relative as we all have difference size hands.Amazing screen! The colors are rich and vibrant when using it, viewing pics, or watching videos.Powerful! It flew threw setup and installing my last Android backup in record time. Also it updated to Nougat while I was setting it up for the first time, so the latest Android OS right from the start was a great bonus!Yes the international version is 64GB of internal memory vs the US's 32, but with up to 256 MicroSD expandable memory, that's not really an issue. Plus not all US carriers provide full bandwidth support for the international version (i.e. you might not get LTE, only 4G) so do your research before buying based on specs alone.Price is right compared to other phones on the market, i.e. the new Google Pixel. I had already pre-ordered my XZ but watched the Pixel announcement and really liked what they are finally doing, but also had some concerns: 1) it's first gen tech. Google is an amazing company but i've been burned before and make it a point to never buy 'the first' of any new tech that's released. 2) it's expensive! if you get the big 128GB model and the insurance it's going to sent you back just under $900 bucks. That's asking a lot for a smartphone, even one that's 100% Google made. So when i looked at the two, i stuck with my XZ and couldn't be happier.And battery life has been really good. Using it all day (8AM to 9PM) without charging and still have 30-40% juice left. Mine came with Sony's rapid charging wall-plug, and I bought some Anker 3.0 USB-C cables (bought through Amazon of course ^_^), so she charges very quickly. I think in under 10 minutes I went from under 50% battery life to 100%.I'm not a tech professional by any means, I'm just your average consumer that's tech savvy and values my dollars going to quality products that I'll get at least 2-3 years solid use out. Yes, there are other Android phones on the market with bigger/better technical specs, but not everything needs to be 100% top-end. If you do that you get crap battery life because that bigger processor and better screen and finger print scanner and all those other 'nice to haves' need juice to run. The more you tack on, the harder the phone has to work, the hotter it runs and the crappier the battery life is. So I'm happy with the Sony XZ because it takes advantage of everything I want in a premium phone, has high-end specs that work in its beautiful design, and they made it so it works as hard without over doing it.All in all it's one of the best Android phones I've ever used, and I've used all the majors (Samsung, Motorola, and HTC) and none of them compare to this. I only hope it sells well so that Sony further invests in the US market because we've been waiting for high-end Android phones like the XZ for years."
"392272","Sony Xperia XZ - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Platinum (US Warranty)",5,"This phone is a powerhouse, I owned the z3, z3+ and now the XZ and I gotta say this is the best I've seen since the super reliable z3 and the battery life is comparable if not better then the Z3 and for those of you that don't know the battery on the Z3 was outstanding. The display on the XZ is unbelievably clear, it's very well made, love the design, it's ridiculously fast like the absolute fastest camera and shutter I have ever seen on a smartphone. Auto focus is unreal and camera app opens instantly (huge improvement of past Sonys). Highly recommend"
"392273","Sony Xperia XZ - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Platinum (US Warranty)",5,"Color - Mineral BlackI am transitioning from Oneplus 3 to Xperia XZ. I am satisfied with the performance my current phone but I am making this shift to XZ only for the design aspect and camera. I have been waiting so long for Sony to release an all rounder phone that can compete with other flagships in the market and this time they nailed it.Pros:Performance: Crisp and fast without any lag.Design: IMO, this is the best looking handset among the current flagships(including iphone 7 and pixel). It's been 3 days since I started using it, and it had already drawn attention from my friends. In one word it will put all the flagships to shame. Thumbs up for the mineral black color.Camera: Manual mode is a killer. Auto focus and video quality is also good. Indoor and low light shots are great if you can tweak little bit in the manual mode.Fingerprint sensor: If you can spend some time and flash the software with UK version, then you will probably unearth one of the amazing and effective finger print sensors in the market. It seems to respond faster than iphone6s, iphone 7 and oneplus 3.Display: Nothing to complain.Speakers: Dual speaker are really cool.SD Card: Not yet installed a micro sd card. So could not comment on that yet.Water proof: Have not tested and no intentions to do it.Cons:Battery: Its just satisfactory. I use my phone quite a bit during day(at least 2 hour talk time, 3 hours of listening music, 1 hour of bluetooth streaming in the car, 2 hours of browsing, social networking and video streaming combined). An extra 10% could have been better in my case.Wish list:Charging Time: Oneplus3 and Pixel has fast charge option that can charge 60% of the phone in 30 mins. I miss that feature in Xperia XZ. It usually takes 60 minutes for 60% charge.Overall: Sony has finally hit the cord by packing all the best and cool features into one single handset XZ. Be it camera, display, performance, fingerprint sensor or dual speakers it perfected each of those features. Price wise it is on the higher end of the spectrum competing with Samsung and Apple. Sony is a premium brand which uses finest materials. It is perceived as an upscale brand even before apple started working on it's ipods. At the same time I would not waste money if they deliver incompetent products(which is the case of some of their earlier xperias).But if a Sony product can compete with Samsung and Apple then I would not mind paying the premium. If you don't want to be one in millions using Iphones and Samsungs and yet do not compromise on quality and performance then the answer is ""Own an Xperia XZ""."
"392274","Sony Xperia XZ - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Platinum (US Warranty)",3,"I like to have the latest phones (not necessarily the most expensive.There's a lot to like (very nice screen, good sony-Android skin, good camera, waterproofing, attractive design.)However, the fact that there's no finger print (I don't want to have to flash it,) 3 GB of memory, and snapdragon 820 when the 821 is out, outweighed the good in this phone.I would've kept it 6 months ago if I was deciding between this and the HTC 10. However, today I'm comparing it with the Google Pixel, which is $50 cheaper. I'm going with the Pixel.Hopefully the next Sony flagship will come out in April/May of next year when all other 2017 Android flagships will come out."

"392281","Sony Xperia XZ - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Platinum (US Warranty)",4,"But coming from an Xperia Z to an XZ it's almost the same just a step up. Better battery, runs faster and smoother, and not to mention a slightly bigger but way brighter screen."
"392282","Sony Xperia XZ - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Platinum (US Warranty)",5,"I've had this phone for a number of weeks now and am very pleased overall.When I was looking to buy a new phone I was comparing this one specifically to Google's Pixel. Some of my initial concerns were getting updates timely, durability, and price.The hardware is standard for 2016 phones. The Pixel has a slightly newer processor that's negligibly faster. It was a disappointment the XZ only had 3GB of RAM though. This was still an upgrade from my previous phone however. There's also 1 very important fact to keep in mind when buying the latest and greatest in processing power - battery life. The Pixel had a beefier (ever so slightly) processor, and yet a smaller battery. Battery life will take a hit because of that. I was much less worried about it with this phone. The XZ (in the US) doesn't have a fingerprint sensor which is a bummer but I'm not going to miss it. The camera IS as high quality as Sony claims. I love it and can get off 10+ pictures without slow down.One of the reasons I was looking into the Pixel was because it would be nice to have a pure android phone. Samsung phones have that god-awful TouchWiz business and Sony's have the Xperia UI. You also have to wait for updates. I'm currently still waiting for Android 7.0 which I'm getting impatient for. The one thing I like about the Xperia is the customizability. Everyone Oo's and Awe's when they see my phone because the menus, buttons, etc all look extremely different from a normal android and they're surprised to find out I haven't rooted it.Some features this phone has that I couldn't get with Google's.Waterproofing - This was HUGE for me. I don't go around getting my phones wet however I have dropped one in the toilet before. That slip-up will destroy non-waterproof phonesSD card slot - If the phone has 64GB of internal memory or more it's not an issue. Unfortunately to get that with the Pixel it massively hiked the price. Beyond what this phone cost.Front facing speakers - This was also a big deal for me. I listen to music quietly in the mornings when getting ready and can't wear headphones while doing it. I hate the way sound comes out muffled when the speakers are pointed somewhere else.In the end I decided I could live with the Xperia interface, one gig less of RAM and slow updates. I like the way this phone looks. It's unique. Sony goes the opposite direction of simply copying Apple like Google did with the Pixel. Anything hardware-wise the Pixel had over the XZ, this phone beat with additional features (like the waterproofing). I feel like for the money I'd rather buy those features than a sliver of improvement in hardware."
"392283","Sony Xperia XZ - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Platinum (US Warranty)",5,"A much more sleek feel in the hands compared to the Z3. A step in the right direction for the xperia line. The reception I get using TMobiles network is great."

"392285","Sony Xperia XZ - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Platinum (US Warranty)",2,"Camera is not good as it says it is, my main reason of purchasing it was the ""beautiful 23mpx camera"". Galaxy s7 does a lot better job with 12mpx than this xz, very disappointed, the sd card slot didn't read the sd card after a day, the camera started glitching. As I said very very disappointed with this phone. Hope Sony will do better next time.And also the phone came in very weird box, looked like it was used item. Not like iPhone sealed box. Didn't liked it."

You can buy an international version which I didn't find convenient or you can follow this [...]The fingerprint scanner is a software limitation only and you can flash it to get the fingerprint enabled, same way as I did with the UK version. Does it void your warranty? Only if you root it and UNLOCK the bootloader of the phone. Flashing a sotware is like installing and update, but unlocking the bootloader is not and you don't have to do it to get the fingerprint scannerIn general, it is a good phone and if you think that you need t buy an international version only to get the scanner you might be wrong"

The iPhone produces some very realistic skin colors. However, the Sony is still a good camera, better than on most phones.I am using this phone on AT&T in the U.S. and it works flawlessly. I consistently get LTE speed most everywhere I go.The only take away I have for this phone would be the squareness of the corners, which will take some getting used. And the fact the U.S. version does not have fingerprint sensor capabilities. Sony - come on, you need to fix this please!!! Pay what you need to pay on the necessary patents and get it done! Once they do, they have the potential to really sell some phones. Otherwise, this is a really GREAT phone and I highly recommend it."

And while they can never seem to conquer the US market, I'm still amazed at the stuff they produce. It's really fast and the colors are crisp and vibrant. The sound as expected from Sony is clear. The camera is definitely an upgrade. I had the Z3 Compact and it has the same pixel size but there's definitely some improvement. The front camera is better but I don't know by how much with low light. So far it's definitely an upgrade from my Z3. I have yet to use the full power of the phone but so far things are going without a hitch! This phone proves how much I love Sony and will continue to be loyal til they stop producing phones. :P"

"392373","Sony Xperia Z C6602 16GB Unlocked GSM Shatter/Water Proof Android Smartphone w/ 13.1MP Camera - White/Black",5,"It's a good phone. But there are some things you should consider before buying.1. There are 2 identically looking models with different frequencies - C6602 and C6603. See which one u want. There is no universal model2. Screen is very good but not IPS. There is some color degradation going when turning it. Also black level is more like gray, so contrast suffers.3. Get ready with your MicroSIM4. Battery life is excellent when on standby, and so-so when actually using phone. Rooting and underclocking CPU does not help much. It might be indicator or something else. Sometimes after 10 min work u get 10% loss of battery. I get 2 days out of battery for now.5. Charger is really awkward, it's two piece which easily falls apart. I don't use it.6. It doesn't support 5.8GHz WiFiIt is still very good looking, fast phone. Speaker is superloud. Music play (MP3) quality is much better than my US SGS3. There is FM radio. It accepts 64GB microSDXC cards. It is water and dust protected. So no regrets on my side."
"392374","Sony Xperia Z C6602 16GB Unlocked GSM Shatter/Water Proof Android Smartphone w/ 13.1MP Camera - White/Black",4,"For now, filled my expectations ..!You feel the quality of the materials, come from a S3 and notice the difference, very fluid and even more with the 253, which improves the launcher, camera and battery life, as with the Galaxy, was not even to late afternoon, but with the Xperia Z, is another thing, I can enjoy it until 20:00 PM that just calls load. For the phone to be perfect, should be getting the update normally and not let him die in time.for me is a 9/10."
"392375","Sony Xperia Z C6602 16GB Unlocked GSM Shatter/Water Proof Android Smartphone w/ 13.1MP Camera - White/Black",1,"I bought this phone and i was so surprised when i received my box. First. I love Sony Ericsson. I have now Sony Ericsson Arc S. So when i open the box i was so confuse. This phone was look like fake. You can understand it since you see the box. Quality of a paper of the box so poor!!! Sony never use it like this!!!! About phone. Phone was with a screen protecter. So the screen was full of bubbles!!!! It wasnt look that somebody take it out already. Was look like Chinese fake! It was in front side and back side. I remember when i ordered my phone (which i use now) it was perfect everything!!!!! And box and quality of paper and screen protect!!!!!! Everything!!! So when i turned on my new phone..Here is the same .. sometimes this phone didnt feel my fingers... So VERY VERY bad quality!!!!! I decided return this phone. Here was again surprise!!! They refund just 80% from cost. So i spend for this phone around $600 They give me back just $468...So they made around $130 from nothing!!!!!!!! and i dont have anything for this money neither!!! Im so mad. It was my first time big order on Amazon. (usually i use ebay). I never had this problem before. All my electronics i bought by internet. I never never will use this company again. So people, be careful with this seller!!!! save your money!!!!"

I dropped it four feet onto concrete this evening and not a scratch! The only thing I want to add is that another reviewer stated this was the docomo version (which would mean japanese and with a locked down bootloader) but the model I received from ranas electronics was not the docomo variant. The bootloader was fully unlockable. I know this matters to a lot of people and I was very pleasantly surprised as I thought I had made a mistake and was going to have to live with rooted stock for the life of this phone."

As long as you're in a decent coverage area, you can get great speeds off it even though it doesn't have LTE. It gets faster then others I've had *on* LTE. Screen is better on it then it appeared on the newer ones, but, maybe it was my imagination. KitKat just came out for it. Sony Developer has all you need incase you want to root - there's a right way and wrong way. The wrong way could cost you warranty, so be careful! I highly recommend this, or any of the Sony's, especially if you have a Sony Store near you.. I can't name another android you can take into a storefront like Apple if your phone is having issues :) oh, and if you're an iphone user, they sell a cable, and have an app, which without a computer, you can transfer all your music, movies, contacts, pictures, etc. with.

It is a very nice looking phone and I like the fact it isn't the phone ""everyone"" has so it stands out to people more. Very thin and sleek! Has every option any other new phone has, is a little less in price, waterproof, very attractive. I had it in my cart for over 2 weeks scared to make the wrong decision. If it is in your cart ""hit the button"" you won't regret it! Everything from old phone transferred so I didn't miss a beat!"

"392442","Sony Xperia Z C6602 Unlocked Phone with 5 inch HD Display and 1.5GHz Quad-Core Processor--U.S. Warranty (Black)",2,"Have had it for one day; am happy with it so far. No problems. My only issues were personal ones...a bit different than the Samsung Galaxy I just replaced so will take a while for me to get used to it. Audio is fine; I don't plan on throwing it into a puddle no matter how waterproof it may be, or dropping it (everyone I've known to drop a Samsung or iPhone has cracked glass); I do plan on being a bit careful with plugging it into the charger...the side it's on makes it cumbersome for charging since that's where the fold is on my case -- meaning I need to be more careful putting it in and pulling the plug out--otherwise I will tend to 'bend' as I pull and perhaps that's what's causing some others a problem. Think it should have been on the same side as the power button.I did have to contact Amazon twice as the order sat there for two days without any movement -- considering I requested 2-day shipping and was promised receipt before it was finally shipped. However, Amazon did get it out and shipped it next day delivery so I received it one-day after promised delivery. Good Job. Amazon responded quickly. Better than Sony who promised delivery and never did.Update: 5/1/2015 - Ok. Almost a year later. Everything has been running fine except two days ago I have started to have the problems others mentioned: restarts on its own every so often, and battery runs dry after a few hours. I don't know what the warranty is on this phone but to my thinking it should be at least a year, and I'll check to see if the credit card company provides me with warranty protection. With so many reviews, just reading the 'answers' section hasn't provided me with a clue as to the problem or what to do about it. Will contact Amazon. Could be that many don't update their ""great"" reviews when the thing falls apart before a year or so. I just don't have the $$ to replace my phone every year. Too bad these phones are made with a non-consumer-replaceable battery.If anyone out there has a solution, please let me know."
"392443","Sony Xperia Z C6602 Unlocked Phone with 5 inch HD Display and 1.5GHz Quad-Core Processor--U.S. Warranty (Black)",4,"Whether you are a young or older, Smartphone doesn't simply mean phone to you; it means everything your brain sees when you hear word ""Smart."" And owning a Smartphone means being smart, whether you are in your 10s or 70s.This phone is a Smartphone, and owning therefore means I am smart. Now, let me tell you why it beats iPhone. Firstly, iPhone as its first letter (i) implies, it's an Intosh phone. Intosh comes from McIntosh, and now I hope you know who I am talking. Basically, Intosh doesn't mean anything about being smart. That is not my point.I have many friends and families who own iPhones, but the thing is they surendered my Sony Xperia Z after viewing couple photos on my phone. Friends and I took the photos in the same conditions, but my phone delivered the highest quality we could never think. Secondly, it takes less time to process applications on this device than ever. Also, it has all entertainments people love and hate. I use the ones I love.What else could I say?On the other hand, the battery discharges faster than it charges, I can say, whereas IPhone's battery keeps the charge for a reasonable amount of time. Other than that, my friends and families who have owned iPhone for a while said my phone is above their.And said, I wonder why Amazon is selling this device at $380 while the original price is up to $750.Please consider this Smartphone if you are looking one that will make you smart!"

"392514","Sony Xperia Z C6602 Unlocked Phone with 5 inch HD Display and 1.5GHz Quad-Core Processor--U.S. Warranty (Black)",5,"This was the first phone i have purchased online. This is not, however my first sony Xperia. 1.3 years prior to purchasing this, i got a sony Xperia Advance from the sony store, and that was a great little phone. My dad then got the xperia ..SP? and eventually all of his sweet features made me so jealous i had to one-up him.I purchased a white model from amazon here. i believe the price at that time was ~390 USD. First thing to know is that this phone uses microSIM. I was unsuccessful in cutting my old sim to fit, so i had to go to the AT&T store to get a microSIM before i could really get this going.All of the features should be listed above. One annoying thing was one of the latest firmware updates. They changed stuff i didnt know would change and i havent found a way to roll it back. Also, some high contrast themes should be INCLUDED with the phone and not a premium, as white screens are annoying. Also some menus became less smooth after the FW update.As far as crashing, it may have happened once or twice now in the 4 months ive had this. but not anything memorable apparently. Battery life can be very good if you have all the right settings on. I dont have data so i dont know how bad it could be.I ran into a friend on campus shortly after getting this and noticed she had the black Z. she is the first and only person i have come across who has this phone. Which is too bad because it competes in the super-phone class next to Nexus 5 and whatever that phone samsung sells is. They all have qualcomm quad core and gigs of ram. The screen of the Z is slightly larger than the Nexus 5 ( i did a side-by-side with my roommate's phone). Havent tested the water resistant features other than wet hands. No issues.I also got a PS3 Dualshock 3 controller and have been able to play SEGA's title Sonic The Hedgehog with better control than just the touchscreen. but with a phone this big, it was already easy to play, same goes for minecraft pocket edition; screen is big enough to see and play. it was not on the Xperia Advance.There may be some other quirks i failed to mention but they are unimportant because you should buy this phone and use it for 10 years and join the coolest club; people with powerful phones that not that many people in North America buy."

They need to make a phone which gives coverage on the fastest bands.AMAZON did not write in their description that it does not have LTE service."
"392529","Sony Xperia Z C6602 Unlocked Phone with 5 inch HD Display and 1.5GHz Quad-Core Processor--U.S. Warranty (Black)",5,"This is by far the best phone I have ever owned. The display is gorgeous, the processor is very fast, the camera is great, and it is waterproof!The Display:The 5 inch display on this phone has a resolution of 1080p. That is the same resolution as your HD tv on a 5 inch screen. This makes for 443 pixels per inch which results in an incredibly sharp picture. You cannot see pixels at all. The display also has Sony's Mobile Bravia Engine 2 which enhances color contrast while watching videos and viewing pictures. This really makes the pictures and videos pop, it makes them incredibly vivid. When the BE2 is not running the display's contrast is not as high, but you don't always need oversaturated colors. The viewing angles are far from stellar but most people will view the screen straight on anyways. Gaming with this screen really is a treat. The display is one of the best around.The Processor:This phone is powered by a quadcore 1.5 ghz Krait S4 chip coupled with 2gbs of ram. This results in incredibly fast performance even when multitaksing. The phone almost never lags. The Krait cores are very quick and are more than adequate, even with a 5 inch full HD display. All the games I have played run well. Browsing the internet is equally as snappy. Pages load quickly and smoothly. Zooming in and out is very quick as well.The quadcore processor in this really flexes its muscles in benchmark tests. I got around 7900 in the quadrant standard, over 2060 on the Geekbench 2, over 20,000 on Antutu, and over 2800 on Passmark Performance. All of these scores are higly impressive and show you what kind of power the device has. The performace does carry over to real world usage.The Cameras:The rear camera is 13.1 megapixels and takes incredible pictures. It has the Exmor RS sensor which adjusts numerous things for you. For the most part the results are stunning. Images come out clear and the colors are very vibrant. Occasionlay you will need to change a few setting around to get a better picture though. For example disabling flash. The camera never fails to impress me. With a camera like this there is no need to carry an actual digital camera around.The front facing camera is 2.2 megapixels and can shoot 1080p video. This is very impressive for a front facing camera because most of the current ones are only capable of 720p.The Buttons and Interface:This phone utilizes the on screen android buttons. They are very responsive and don't take up too much space. The side buttons (like the power button and volume rocker) are responsive and easy to press as well. I have no complaints about the buttons.Sony has there own overlay for the Android OS. It is very light and very pleasing to the eyes. It has many great features such as small apps. With small apps you can open a miniature app while running another at the same time, both on the screen. For example, you can open a calculator while on the browser. This feature can be incredibly useful and convenient. I prefer Sony's overlay over Samsung's TouchWiz. My only real complaint when it comes to Sony's overlay is that it lacks a default task manager.The on sceen keyboard is very responsive and auto-correct works well. Turning the phone sideways gives you a lot of room, especially if you have larger hands.The Music Player:A lot of people use their phones as there music players and some phones have horrible audio quality. This phone is not one of those phones. Audio quality is great and there are many different settings that you can adjust to get the best sound. You have five band equalizers and all kinds of different options such as a dynamic normailizer which adjusts the volume differences between songs. Even though the phone has all these options I find myselfy using the ""Clear Audio+"" option. This automatically adjusts the equalizers for each song and the result is great. All the songs sound nice and, well clear with this feature.The music player is very nice to look at, it changes color based on the album artwork which is very neat. You can create playlists on the phone and even edit the music info. If you spelled the name of a song wrong when transfering it, you can fix it right there on the phone. If you are missing album artwork you can get it right on the phone. I am very pleased with the music player on this device.The ""Waterproof featue"":This phone is designed to survive under one meter of water for up to half an hour at a time. While most people will avoid getting their phones wet it is a comforting feature to have. It is also a unique feature for a high end smartphone. It means you won't have to say ""bye"" to your phone if you drop it in the bathtub.The Battery Life:Battery life on the phone is decent. It is nothing great. I get about 1 and a half days of moderate to heavy usage before I have to charge it (with stamina mode enabled). The phone has ""Stamina Mode"" which turns off things while they are not in use. This does help the battery life quite and bit and is a useful feature.Connectivity:This phone is a GSM phone and is capable of HSPA+ 4G. This one is NOT LTE Capable. This is not a factor for me because my provider doesn't offer LTE.The wifi connector on this phone is good. It has a good range and is allows for a quick and strong connection. Of all the devices in my house it is able to get the fastest upload speeds on the exact same connection.Storage:The phone comes with 16gbs of storage but allows expansion via a micro sd card slot. Only about 11.7gbs of the internal storage are available for usage but if you have a micro sd card you can have more than a sufficient amount of storage for your pictures, music, videos, and applications. My only major complaint with the storage is that it doesn't allow the transfer of apps to the SD card. This feature would be very useful.Conclusion:This is an incredible phone and is a great deal. It offers incredible performance and an amazing display. Sony has a great overlay that is innovative and light on the processor. The camera is of stellar quality and the overall build of the phone is as well. It is not a cheap plastic phone. In addition it can survive being submerged in water which is something that no other phone in its class can boast. This is an outstanding phone and I am very satisfied with it!UPDATE (1/2/14):The phone is now running on android 4.3 and the newer OS brought many small improvements with it.Main Changes:-The Music Player is now much louder. It's about as loud as my Ipod Touch now.-The Camera UI has changed slightly. It's now more similar to the one found on the Z1.-You can now download additional theme packs from the Play Store.-The color calibration in the home screens and app screens has changed slightly.-Synthetic Benchmark scores have improved. The phone now scores about 9000 on Quadrant Standard."

"392543","Sony Xperia Z C6602 Unlocked Phone with 5 inch HD Display and 1.5GHz Quad-Core Processor--U.S. Warranty (Black)",5,"...and I've had quite a few. After learning it's lesson with the heavy-handed (and painfully slow) Timescape, Sony's Android skin is smooth and silky, never more so than on the Xperia Z. I am honestly surprised how much I fell for this phone, as am huge tech junkie and go through 'em quick either through contract or importing 'em outright. But the Z is solid, the weight is great, and is sexy as all get-out. The update Walkman app is a fine and fluid hub for all your music, and with the SD card slot, you can really pack 'em in. Camera is fantastic, tho can't touch Nokia's Lumia 1020 (who can?). Forget the nitpicking you've heard over the viewing angles of the screen-with clarity and color like this, you're gonna spend all your time staring at it head on. Waterproofing is lagniappe but very cool. While Samsung is busy copying and churning out the same old stuff and cheap design, Sony is going through the stratosphere on sleekness, speed and style. My sim card has been stuck in this phone ever since I got it, and if you knew me, you'd know what a big deal that is. Can't wait to pair it with the Smartwatch 2, on it's way. Touche, Sony and keep it up!"

"392563","Sony Xperia Z C6602 Unlocked Phone with 5 inch HD Display and 1.5GHz Quad-Core Processor--U.S. Warranty (Black)",5,"To start with, this thing is gorgeous. The edges are lined with a plastic/rubber like material which does not stand out. The back is reflective enough to see your face on and has 'XPERIA' lettered onto it. Other than the large, silver lock button on the side, this thing would have been perfectly symmetrical. It's very thing but the edges are squared so you can have stand anywhere level at both portrait and landscape view.If you still did not know... this thing is COMPLETELY waterproof. Took it into a swimming pool, shower and Jacuzzi. Works perfectly. I don't bother with wiping grease or sweat from it anymore, just stick it under the sink and dry it off. I've also dropped it several times onto asphalt, carpet and tiles (all accidental. Yes I'm a bit clumsy) and there isn't a single scratch on it... The 'bumper' edges work really well.Originally the software was kind of laggy. Some of the apps responded slow but with the latest android update (Version 4.3 at the time of this review) its become almost flawless. The camera is great, even in low light conditions and Sony recently added a lot of new features for it.Now for some less common details. I have not had to root the phone yet. Sony bundled in some handy features. One of them is external drive support. What that means is you can buy an 'OTG' cable (2 or 3$ from Amazon) and use that to plug in an external flash drive or hard drive and transfer files to and from it. Not sure about other android devices but on my Nexus 7 in order to use that feature, it had to be rooted. So far its supported my 1 TB external drive without problems.The other feature is native support for PS3 controllers. Combine a PS3 controller (or any usb gamepads) with the OTG cable and you can use that to play games on your device.I had originally bought this for about 530$ but its even cheaper now. Definitely a must buy."

The screen is beautiful except in certain bright light settings, when you can see the bits that make up the screen. They look like lots of little rectangles on underneath the glass. Apart from that, my experience so far has been good, the battery life is as expected for modern phones, it will last for two days with little usage or almost one day with heavy usage. The images that this phones captures are of very high quality, so much so that on our last vacation we did not take our regular point and shoot because the phones are so good at it. The screen and back of this phone are a fingerprint magnet, so if you are OCD like me be sure and have a soft cloth on hand to clean it after every conversation or after any extended usage. I have tested the water resistant claims of the phone by having a shower and using it to answer a call and also to check an email, it still works up to the time of this writing."

"392590","Sony Xperia Z C6602 Unlocked Phone with 5 inch HD Display and 1.5GHz Quad-Core Processor--U.S. Warranty (Black)",5,"I bought the Xperia Z 6602 model about 6 weeks and absolutely love it. I bought it because it met most of my criteria. It's water proof. I'll take their word for it. I had a bad experience once with a Motorola Razr that was supposed to be waterproof as well but turned out not to be as water proof as they said it was. Moving on, I also wanted a quad core with a decent amount of ram and Sony delivered very well on both. I updated mine to 4.3 as soon as I got it and it's very snappy, no lag at all. I also wanted an SD slot so I could transfer the 32gb card from my old Samsung along with all my data. Plus I wanted an android phone. I have an iPad and really like apple products but I find iTunes to be more trouble than it's worth. I run Windows 8 on my desktop and like Windows but not on my phone. Windows RT has a long way to go before it's ready for prime time. To me, Android is the only viable choice for a smart phone.I also wanted a decent camera with a flash and Sony delivered here as well. It takes pretty decent pictures but it's not perfect. In my opinion the iPhone cameras are more user friendly and take slightly better pictures. The thing with the Sony camera is you have to play with the settings to get nice pictures. It has a superior auto feature that is supposed to take nice pictures without any manual settings but they seem to come out better if you set it up manually. In daylight the pictures are perfect. It's the low light where things get tricky. There's a lot of camera software and options on this phone that you won't find on any other smart phone. If you're willing to play with the different filters and focus options you can get some nice low light pictures with it. I find the single auto focus and backlight correction seem to produce the best low light pictures. For me it doesn't quite replace my pocket camera and definitely not our SLR camera either but for a smart phone camera it's more than adequate.I also wanted high speed mobile data and the HSPA+ is way better than my old 3g Samsung. It would be nice if they would include an LTE radio on the 6602, but it's not going to happen. If you want a US market Xperia Z with an LTE radio in it you have to get the 6606 from T Mobile but then you get a T Mobile Logo on the back, and another T Mobile logo on the lock screen and it uses their custom boot loader so for me I'd rather live without the LTE radio and stay with the unlocked model. And by the way, don't buy the 6603 model if you're planning on using it in the US. It's designed for use overseas and will not give you LTE or HSPA+ bands in the US. It will only give you the old Edge network which is like going back to dial up.The other thing I wanted was an NFC chip. This is actually my biggest gripe about the Sony. It has the NFC chip and supports android beam but due to the secure element it is blocked from working with google wallet for tap and pay. There are some work arounds like rooting the phone and using root explorer to change the device name to something like Nexus or Galaxy but you shouldn't have to root your phone just to be able to pay for a cup of coffee with your phone. My current solution is using the google wallet debit card. Also from what I've read the Kit Kat update which is due out this month is supposed to fix the google wallet issue.My other requirements were for it to be unlocked and it is. I wanted to have tethering built in natively without rooting or apps and it is. Also SIP is built in natively and works perfectly, no apps required. I needed GPS and of course it has it and it works very well. My other and one of my main requirements was good sound and Sony hit the nail on the head with the sound quality. I love the Walkman app and also the built in FM radio is a very nice touch.One of the other best features on this phone is the chipset control widget. It's very nice to not have to go in to settings to control wif, Bluetooth, mobile data, nfc, backlight, etc. You can control them all from the widget. Very useful. The battery life is very acceptable, no complaints there. I also wanted screen capture which is built natively into Android now and works great by pressing the power button and volume down button for one second.And probably my biggest requirement is for the phone to work well and it really does. The first call I made to my friend Jim, he said ""Where are you calling me from, it sounds like you're in the next room."" Very clear calls and great cellular reception even in areas with weak signals where other phones would be dropping the calls the Xperia just works.One thing lacking at this time is a built in emoji keyboard for texting friends with iphones. It comes with Whatsapp pre installed with an emoji keyboard that works great. However, I understand that the Kit Kat update will finally add an emoji keyboard as well so hopefully that will be resolved soon.What I really like about this phone is how thin and light it is. I also like not having the same phone as everyone else. And the size of the phone seems to be more in the phablet category than the phone category but that's ok. It still fits in my pocket and since I got it I don't have to carry my iPad around with me at work anymore because the 5"" screen size is big enough to actually read email and view web pages on.Basically there are way more pros to this phone than cons. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a quality, unlocked, GSM smart phone at a reasonable price. If you're a hard core tech junkie and want the latest updates as soon as they come out and an LTE radio in an unlocked phone then maybe you should buy a Nexus. For a skinned, unlocked android phone, the Xperia is the best of the best."

Love its camera, pretty sharp pictures, with pro settings for a more professional experience, and now i can take photos underwater. Beautiful display, amazing colors. Very powerful processor, no lags when multitasking, supports high-end games. It comes with Sony preinstalled apps like Walkman and Playstation Mobile. The NFC feature is lovely and since this is an unlocked phone it can be used it with whichever brand i want.Cons:speakers get low sound after you get into water, this can be easily fixed by letting the phone drying several hours. cant move apps to sd, every single app you install gets saved on internal memory and you can only store music, photos, videos and else on external microSD, this should not be a problem, as the phone has an internal memory of more than 10gb, but this capacity can be exhausted if lots of games are downloaded.I believe that the greatness of the phone consumes the battery a little faster, or am I the one doing this by using it a lot? Cant say, simply amazing!!!!!"

But the washed out screen, HORRIBLE battery life, and tinny sounding 'speaker' made the phone just not worth it. Don't tell me about 'turn wifi off, turn GPS off, turn data off'..You may as well just TURN THE PHONE OFF.

"392615","Sony Xperia Z C6602 Unlocked Phone with 5 inch HD Display and 1.5GHz Quad-Core Processor--U.S. Warranty (Black)",5,"Steve Jobs made me mad when my perfectly good iphone 3 was made functionally obsolete by an update in iOs. I was in the market for a tablet at the time. In an effort to get even with apple I actively sought an alternative to their ecosystem. After looking at several android tablets, I settled on the Sony tablet S- their first android tablet (I should probably identify myself as a Sony fan boy...). It has been a year and a half and have been pleasantly surprised- in fact, I'd say that I prefer android now.So with that as a backdrop, I'll now tell you about the Xperia Z- I have had it for just short of two months. At the start, it took some adjustment to how it gets things done versus iOs- subtle differences that were unfamiliar at first. After working thru that break in and learning how stuff works, I can say that I am very happy with this phone. It works without hiccups and has been very smooth. Every function I've tried has worked- ""throwing"" media to a dlna compatible device is still a bit jerry and hit or miss. Integration with other Sony products is solid to the extent that the other Sony products are modern enough to be integrated. The phone is well made, thoughtfully laid out, and sized to be functional in the hand. The screen is responsive to touch, gorgeous to behold. Sony's tweaks on stock Android are unobtrusive and often very functional additions (my wife wishes her Samy phone could run some of the Sony ""small apps"" and a few of the other proprietary Sony stuff). Android 4.2.2 came a few weeks ago and offers some enhancements over the previous edition. Sony also introduced a ""find my Xperia"" function which seems to work well in the testing I've done with it. It's nice to be able to wash this phone off too. I purposely avoid wristwatches, and footware that are not waterproof- to not have these items waterproof just doesn't make sense in my life. And I would add a phone to the list of things that will have to be waterproof in my life going forward. It's hard to think of another item that you use daily while you are out and about, that you handle in public places and then put up to your face without washing it off. It seems to be catching on as a concept too- I saw a new version of the Samy galaxy phone is available in a waterproof edition. It only makes sense...I would also recommend you consider purchase of a phone thru amazon where possible (without a contract) the ""bloatware"" that at&t, t-mobile, Verizon and others put on phones you get from them is just about useless, and only serves you adds from the carrier- no thank you. Alot of it cannot be removed from your phone either.In summary, I would gladly order this phone again, and I would recommend it to others."

It's really slim with a large screen and so nice looking. Everyone compliments me on this phone. It takes gorgeous photos too! The only thing though, I have a problem with is the battery life.

"392617","Sony Xperia Z C6602 Unlocked Phone with 5 inch HD Display and 1.5GHz Quad-Core Processor--U.S. Warranty (Black)",3,"Last phone was a Google Nexus 4, $300+s/h/tax ($350). What was bad about the Nexus 4 was a bluetooth issue with my car. This phone does not have that problem. +1 XperiaZ. However the Nexus 4 grabs the cellular signal much better. +1 Nexus4.This phone gets Real Warm with regular web use. Seems to cool off to what I think is a more appropriate temperateure if you turn off data altogether but it otherwise (data on) it is unpleasantly hot with any use.This phone has about the same processor and battery but plays Need for Speed Most Wanted with more lag, for the only practical comparison of performance. They are both fast. This phone has better camera. Sound quality seems very good but I do not like the placement of the speakerphone which is in the bottom right corner of the phone and is very easy to cover with your finger, making it near silent.I like the photo gallery, but the rest of Sony's bloatware is unappreciated by me and anything that can extend the battery and reduce useless processor time (heat) would be more desirable.I'm having a hard time not pushing the button to return this phone. I want to like it but the reduced coverage & battery life are a really big deal for me, for the money they are charging for this and the comparables I think it is not up to snuff."

The phone is pretty rugged too and the times I've dropped it by accident, it haven't broke yet.The High Res display is just awesome, Sony always brings out sharp crisp displays.Call quality is crisp and clear.ConsThe speaker on the phone is not so great, whenever I'm trying to listen to music or watch videos, it is muffled and distorted, especially when gripping the phones at times.T-Mobile bloatware, just annoys me and kind of slows the phone down.C6066 model, hard to upgrade to lollipop, had to manual to do it."

Everything works amazing and I have no problems with it. No 4G but that does not bother me because the 3G works amazing and only paying $45 a month for unlimited everything with a phone like this, why should I be picky about a little bit faster speed. Phone is great, if youre on the fence about buying this, BUY IT! its worth it!Pros:-Works with Straight Talk Bring Your Own Phone $45 Unlimited Everything Plan. And works like a charm with fast speed!-Water proof (and beer proof too =D)-Amazing Camera-Good speaker-Use my PS3 controller with it-Use the PSP Emulator on HD graphics setting with no lag. Amazing for a phone!-Screen looks crystal clear (sometimes I watch Hulu and Netflix and the phone instead of my TV)-Feels like a premium phone and not something with plastic built-Xperia Rom is an amazing home screen.Cons:-No 4G (but not that big of a deal)-When I first put my 64GB Micro SD card in, it deleted everything without promting me to format. I had to get all my music back.-Sometimes my widgets stop working. Have to reboot the phone. Only happens about once every one to two weeks-Compare to the Galaxy S3 the sound quality for music output is ehhhh. (but still not bad)"
"393427","Sony Xperia Z1 (C6902) Unlocked GSM Quad-Core Water Resistant/Dust Proof Smartphone w/ 20MP Camera- Black",4,"I bought this model not knowing that it couldn't be used on the 4G network with ATT, as it is only a 3G model.If I had done some more research I would have known that the model I needed was the C6906 for the 4G LTE. I was shocked that so high priced of phone wouldn't offer 4g to begin with, and I have to deduct a star on that alone. I have to say though that the phone is a lot better in responsiveness to my old LG Optimus G Pro, and I am really in love with it overall, except for the lack of 4G. :(I really love the size of the phone, and I also love the fact that I am not accidentally opening apps and the home screen every time I pick it up or put into my pocket.... the Optimus G Pro was absolutely a nightmare when it came to this and I got tired of it.I highly recommend this phone to anyone who does a lot of social networking and picture taking ,as there are plenty of apps for that already installed on the phone. The pictures that you can take with this phone are gorgeous, and I think any enthusiast would be pleased to have it.The only knock I have with the phone is that the battery life could be a lot better in my opinion, which might boil down to a software issue that perhaps Sony can fix in the future.If you look at the reviews and benchmarks on this phone concerning battery life, you will see that it has a higher battery life than most all other phones in talk time, but falls way short in web browsing and watching videos, and I can see that for myself using it to verify it.I hope that for those looking to enjoy 4G on this phone with the TMobile and ATT network will not make the same mistake I made in getting the C6902 model ,and find this review helpful"

"393431","Sony Xperia Z1 (C6902) Unlocked GSM Quad-Core Water Resistant/Dust Proof Smartphone w/ 20MP Camera- Black",2,"After 2 years this phone has finally kicked the bucket. At first I was incredibly impressed with all of its features (the slick design, easy layout, and waterproof capabilities). But as time went on, I noticed little annoyances here and there (camera freezing, randomly resetting, buttons and flaps breaking off, speaker loosing volume, and headphone jack not working). The last few months I owned it, the battery life slowly got worse and worse, until the point where I could only use my phone with low battery consumption for 1 hour before it drains from supposedly 95% to 0% and immediately shut off. As of right now, it no longer charges or turns on, so it's going to be a pain to get my files off of it, but frankly, I put up with this phone for 2 years, and I am glad it is gone so I can get a much higher quality phone.

This devices size brings back a day where all cell phones were similar in size and it wasn't about screen size (back then) it was about what was inside.This device is packed w/ todays mid to high end specs, that said, the screen resolution is not quite on par with today's specs.This is a rare device/company that brings Android 4.4.4 quickly to their devices. Within the first week of ownership, the device morphed from Android 4.4.2 to 4.4.4. We own several ""high end"" Android devices (HTC M8, LG G3 etc) and not one has 4.4.4 yet.Overall, this device is compact durable and comfortable to hold. It does however need some kind of re-work on all the ""doors"" which acess things such as the usb port.

"393454","Sony Xperia Z1 (C6902) Unlocked GSM Quad-Core Water Resistant/Dust Proof Smartphone w/ 20MP Camera- Black",5,"Going from a Nexus 4 (and another xperia before that). This phone is just pure bliss. It's blazing fast, it's got features that are unique, and the camera is top notch.Pros:1. Great Camera - Sometimes I feel like I'm using a DSLR (especially using addon apps). The nighttime photos are even great. And more recently, if you unlock you can get 4k video + 120 FPS - crazy slow mo.2. Great Apps - most apps can be disabled that you don't like, but this is only of the only phones I have kept more than half of the ""bloat"" ware. Unlike Samsung, Sony decided to make some useful apps.3. Updates/Upgrades - This phone is expected to upgrade to the latest ""L"" android so you have nothing to worry about.4. Sleek look - If you look at this phone without a case, I would say its one of the best looking phones out there. It just looks and feels ""premium"".5. Waterproof/Dustproof - I don't worry about sweating my phone to death now, so i've got that going...which is nice.Cons:1. Whats New App - seriously the dumbest app known to man. And they placed it near google now to I guess compete with it. You can disable it without root, but you need to do it with your computer and adb drivers (pretty easy once you read up on it).2. Slippery - this phone feels like it's made of a slightly melted butter stick - get a rubberized case as soon as possible or you will drop it. I wish Sony would send me the lube they are using to make this glass... for science."

"393485","Sony Xperia Z1 (C6902) Unlocked GSM Quad-Core Water Resistant/Dust Proof Smartphone w/ 20MP Camera- Purple",2,"After 2 years this phone has finally kicked the bucket. At first I was incredibly impressed with all of its features (the slick design, easy layout, and waterproof capabilities). But as time went on, I noticed little annoyances here and there (camera freezing, randomly resetting, buttons and flaps breaking off, speaker loosing volume, and headphone jack not working). The last few months I owned it, the battery life slowly got worse and worse, until the point where I could only use my phone with low battery consumption for 1 hour before it drains from supposedly 95% to 0% and immediately shut off. As of right now, it no longer charges or turns on, so it's going to be a pain to get my files off of it, but frankly, I put up with this phone for 2 years, and I am glad it is gone so I can get a much higher quality phone. RIP Xperia Z1. You were almost worth it."

"393504","Sony Xperia Z1 (C6902) Unlocked GSM Quad-Core Water Resistant/Dust Proof Smartphone w/ 20MP Camera- Purple",5,"I had this phone for a month now through StraightTalk's bring your own phone plan. Everything works amazing and I have no problems with it. No 4G but that does not bother me because the 3G works amazing and only paying $45 a month for unlimited everything with a phone like this, why should I be picky about a little bit faster speed. Phone is great, if youre on the fence about buying this, BUY IT! its worth it!Pros:-Works with Straight Talk Bring Your Own Phone $45 Unlimited Everything Plan. And works like a charm with fast speed!-Water proof (and beer proof too =D)-Amazing Camera-Good speaker-Use my PS3 controller with it-Use the PSP Emulator on HD graphics setting with no lag. Amazing for a phone!-Screen looks crystal clear (sometimes I watch Hulu and Netflix and the phone instead of my TV)-Feels like a premium phone and not something with plastic built-Xperia Rom is an amazing home screen.Cons:-No 4G (but not that big of a deal)-When I first put my 64GB Micro SD card in, it deleted everything without promting me to format. I had to get all my music back.-Sometimes my widgets stop working. Have to reboot the phone. Only happens about once every one to two weeks-Compare to the Galaxy S3 the sound quality for music output is ehhhh. (but still not bad)"
"393505","Sony Xperia Z1 (C6902) Unlocked GSM Quad-Core Water Resistant/Dust Proof Smartphone w/ 20MP Camera- Purple",4,"I bought this model not knowing that it couldn't be used on the 4G network with ATT, as it is only a 3G model.If I had done some more research I would have known that the model I needed was the C6906 for the 4G LTE. I was shocked that so high priced of phone wouldn't offer 4g to begin with, and I have to deduct a star on that alone. I have to say though that the phone is a lot better in responsiveness to my old LG Optimus G Pro, and I am really in love with it overall, except for the lack of 4G. :(I really love the size of the phone, and I also love the fact that I am not accidentally opening apps and the home screen every time I pick it up or put into my pocket.... the Optimus G Pro was absolutely a nightmare when it came to this and I got tired of it.I highly recommend this phone to anyone who does a lot of social networking and picture taking ,as there are plenty of apps for that already installed on the phone. The pictures that you can take with this phone are gorgeous, and I think any enthusiast would be pleased to have it.The only knock I have with the phone is that the battery life could be a lot better in my opinion, which might boil down to a software issue that perhaps Sony can fix in the future.If you look at the reviews and benchmarks on this phone concerning battery life, you will see that it has a higher battery life than most all other phones in talk time, but falls way short in web browsing and watching videos, and I can see that for myself using it to verify it.I hope that for those looking to enjoy 4G on this phone with the TMobile and ATT network will not make the same mistake I made in getting the C6902 model ,and find this review helpful"

This devices size brings back a day where all cell phones were similar in size and it wasn't about screen size (back then) it was about what was inside.This device is packed w/ todays mid to high end specs, that said, the screen resolution is not quite on par with today's specs.This is a rare device/company that brings Android 4.4.4 quickly to their devices. Within the first week of ownership, the device morphed from Android 4.4.2 to 4.4.4. We own several ""high end"" Android devices (HTC M8, LG G3 etc) and not one has 4.4.4 yet.Overall, this device is compact durable and comfortable to hold. It does however need some kind of re-work on all the ""doors"" which acess things such as the usb port. This is defiantly something I can see breaking, rather easily.This is well made, I would recommend this to any user looking for a change back to a decent sized device."
"393522","Sony Xperia Z1 (C6902) Unlocked GSM Quad-Core Water Resistant/Dust Proof Smartphone w/ 20MP Camera- Purple",5,"Going from a Nexus 4 (and another xperia before that). This phone is just pure bliss. It's blazing fast, it's got features that are unique, and the camera is top notch.Pros:1. Great Camera - Sometimes I feel like I'm using a DSLR (especially using addon apps). The nighttime photos are even great. And more recently, if you unlock you can get 4k video + 120 FPS - crazy slow mo.2. Great Apps - most apps can be disabled that you don't like, but this is only of the only phones I have kept more than half of the ""bloat"" ware. Unlike Samsung, Sony decided to make some useful apps.3. Updates/Upgrades - This phone is expected to upgrade to the latest ""L"" android so you have nothing to worry about.4. Sleek look - If you look at this phone without a case, I would say its one of the best looking phones out there. It just looks and feels ""premium"".5. Waterproof/Dustproof - I don't worry about sweating my phone to death now, so i've got that going...which is nice.Cons:1. Whats New App - seriously the dumbest app known to man. And they placed it near google now to I guess compete with it. You can disable it without root, but you need to do it with your computer and adb drivers (pretty easy once you read up on it).2. Slippery - this phone feels like it's made of a slightly melted butter stick - get a rubberized case as soon as possible or you will drop it. I wish Sony would send me the lube they are using to make this glass... for science."

I hate this trend of making high end smart phones giants. Ill admit that the 5in screen size makes reading small text in games and dealing with emails easier, but it is not an ideal size for holding. The small size is wonderful to hold and the phone feels great in hand not HTC One great, With clean lines surrounding the two beautiful slabs of glass. I wish they would have pushed the screen size up a bit the borders are kinda large, its just a waste of space, when other phones on the market are smaller with similar specs. The color was my only concern when buying this device. Its stated as Lime but in all photos I have viewed its just yellow. I think Sony is confused on what color lime is, when held in certain indirect light you can see the green in the paint. If you do not want a yellow phone get the white model. I enjoy the color more than i thought that I would, its great to look at and i find myself placing the phone on its screen more than i would with any thing i own, just to see the back."

"394541","SONY XPERIA Z3 COMPACT D5803 16GB (FACTORY UNLOCKED) INTERNATIONAL MODEL- WHITE No-Warranty",2,"I read so many good things about this phone. Battery life is great but most everything else sucked. Camera was terrible especially the front one which took horribly grainy photos even in non low light situations. It couldn't take photos underwater because the touch screen wouldn't respond when it was under water. The first one I ordered had been opened and came with a different plug and want the standard American plug or adapter. The next one I got hadn't been opened but also didn't come with an American plug although it had an I'll fitting adapter.The biggest kicker was that i couldn't send or receive MMS messages with this phone on T-Mobile. They sent the issue to their engineering department, we went over the APN settings time and again and they finally figured out it was that this phone couldn't send them for some reason. Couldn't send snapchat photos at first either although that resolved after some updates and restarts to the phone.Thank you to Amazon for having a great return policy because this phone was nothing like the reviews"

The seller sent me the product in the expected conditions, the problem is the product. The second time that I used the WATER PROOF cellphone, less than 10 min and no more than 1.5 m (respecting the specifications) WATER GOT INSIDE AND OF COURSE, CELLPHONE WAS DAMAGED. I sent to Sony, they did the tests and said it was my fault! LESS THAN 3 MONTHS and I just threw my money away. I had only 3 phones in my life ( 7 years since I got the the first) I just bought new ones because they did not attend my demand, but they were working. So, who has the fault?

"394558","SONY XPERIA Z3 COMPACT D5803 16GB (FACTORY UNLOCKED) INTERNATIONAL MODEL- WHITE No-Warranty",5,"I'm about as happy with this as I could ever be with a smart phone. I still miss my old flip phone with mechanical keys and the old T9 word no-eyes-needed texting, but alas smartphones do have many conveniences such as GPS and music playing.BATTERY LIFE: Fantastic, I get ~3 days from normal usage. THREE DAYS!SIZE: Slightly bigger than an iPhone 4s. Acceptable. I don't want an HDTV in my pocket.CALLS: No complaints, I use T-Mobile and get pretty good coverage and data rates in New Jersey.ANDROID: Upgraded to Lollipop, works fairly well, had some issues with getting some apps to use my microSD card correctly, was frustrating, but in the end got them to work. Google Maps etc. all work great. Slightly paranoid about Google in a 1984 kind of way. Annoys me to no end that the Amazon Prime app requires every permission from the operating system, including the ability to delete your account (yes, that's correct). I have not and don't plan to install the app until they release a Google Play friendly version. In general, Android is still less of a smooth experience (particularly when it comes to the touch interface) than Apple. Not taking away stars for these issues because they're not the fault of the phone manufacturer.MISC: Love that I can use a 128GB microSD card with this phone. I heard that screen cracks are common with this phone, so I got a case (Ringke Fusion) and I'm careful with it and so far so good in 3 months. No screen protector. Looks pretty. Nobody knows what phone this is, and that secretly makes me very happy inside. I can play music to my car via Bluetooth fairly easily. My car has steering wheel music controls which used to control my iPhone, I miss that, but I knew I was losing that when switching to Android. This phone also has an average EMF output which maybe will slightly reduce my risk of cancer. Who knows.SPEAKERS: Tinny and kind of crappy. Oh well.CAMERA: Pretty decent, not great in low light conditions, personally I don't take a lot of pictures with my phone so I don't really care much."

I can reach all keys on the screen comfortable with just one hand, and it slides into the back pocket of my jeans. Love that it's waterproof, I spilled coffee on it within about 2 weeks and was pretty happy I'd ordered this model. Make sure to get a magnetic charger (I use a dock) so you don't have to open the ports all the time. I won't give a detailed technical review, you can read much better ones online.

That was the most expensive 3 weeks of my life with a phone because I thin spent three hundred dollars trying to repair it. So around 800 dollars all in, I still don't have a working phone. What happened? These phones are known to ""spontaneously"" crack. That means I didn't drop it or do anything wrong. It just cracked as I was using it. One clean crack across the entire face, rendering it useless because the screen stopped working. If you google it, you'll see this is a common problem. I called Sony and they weren't much help. I couldn't find a phone repair shop in the U.S. that works on Sony phones. I tried to do it myself but kept running into more problems. Bottom line: it's a paper weight. Sony made a crappy product and then wouldn't help to fix it. Don't buy one."

"394569","SONY XPERIA Z3 COMPACT D5803 16GB (FACTORY UNLOCKED) INTERNATIONAL MODEL- WHITE No-Warranty",4,"After 4 days, very happy with this phone. Takes great pictures and video. With the ""Stamina"" battery saving mode on, I can go 2-3 days between charging. And the phone is super fast with Quad Core processor (Item description is wrong, this phone has 2.5GHz Quad Core Snapdragon 801 processor).Only had very minor issues so far getting the to work in english and with AT&T. I bought it used from Amazon Warehouse Deals and when I received it, the menus were not in English (was either German or Dutch). Luckily, I was able to use Google Goggles on my android tablet to figure out which menu would reset the phone. When the phone resets, the first thing it asks is is what language, so after that it worked out fine. BTW, the phone is unlocked, but the original carrier was Vodafone in Europe. The phone works fine for me on AT&T. There are a couple of Vodafone apps that I was not able to remove, but they don't really effect my phone usage (so far). Once I got my AT&T SIM card in the phone I could call and send text messages right away, but I did have to download the proper internet settings to get on the internet. To find this menu option, goto:Settings>Wireless&Networks>More...>Internet Settingsand then check the box for your carrier. Then you should be on the internet.This is my first Android phone. I've really enjoyed my last 2 phones which were Windows Phones, but I wanted a better camera and I wasn't really satisfied with the current generation of Windows Phones. After being on the lookout for the past 3-4 months, this is the ONLY phone that really suits my needs. I wanted a phone that was about the same size as the iPhone 5 and my two things that I absolutely must have are a good camera with dedicated shutter button and long battery life (large battery or battery saving mode/feature. My ideal price range was under $400 but really if I found a phone with the right features, I would probably pay more. (I paid $415 used price). This phone is awesome because even though it is smaller than the regular Xperia z3, it is every bit as fast and nearly identical in specs to the bigger flagship model. The only difference in specs is screen resolution (720p), battery size (2600mAH vs 3100mAH) and RAM (2Gb vs 3 GB). Samsung and HTC make ""mini"" versions of their flagship phones, but the ""mini"" version is hobbled by poorer quality or less features. Those other ""mini"" flagship phones always have a slower processor, lower quality camera and other missing features compared to the flagship.One of my favorite features is the ""Stamina"" mode which extends battery life. I went all day yesterday and still had 89% battery left this morning (24 hours since charging). I do not like my phone beeping at me all day, so I don't have email, facebook or instagram pushing anything to my phone. I might spend 20-30 minutes during my lunch break checking in on my phone and then maybe 30-60 minutes in the evening after work. In Stamina mode, my phone does not go onto the internet unless the phone is open and unlocked. If the phone is in my pocket, it is off wifi. It also has a nifty location aware feature where it only turns on wifi based on location if it knows I am near WIFI networks that I have previously signed into. Otherwise WIFI is off. I only use the WIFI at work (no cell reception) and do not use it at home (AT&T LTE is faster on my phone than the Time Warner Digital Cable Roadrunner connection at home). With my 30-90 minutes of web browsing during the day, 2-3 instagram postings and 10-20 text messages a day, I only used 10% battery in 24 hours with the Stamina mode on. AMAZING!Bonus feature? It says it is water resistant. I haven't found out yet if that is true. I wouldn't drop it in water on purpose -doesn't seem like it is waterproof, but splashproof maybe. I will update if I find out one way or the other."

"394571","SONY XPERIA Z3 COMPACT D5803 16GB (FACTORY UNLOCKED) INTERNATIONAL MODEL- WHITE No-Warranty",4,"No cyanogenmod available for it yet so the Sony-branded vibe instead of vanilla Android bothers me somewhat, but it's a fantastic upgrade from my Galaxy Nexus and a real pleasure to have flagship-level power in a compact phone. It's fast, smooth, and everything that you would expect in a new phone performance-wise.Very exciting that there is a camera button instead of having to tap the screen to take pictures (which often results in blurrier photos). I didn't test the camera in low-light conditions before unlocking the bootloader, so I can't comment on how much functionality/quality was lost there. The low-light photos I shoot now are neither impressively good or bad, just slightly grainy and slow like you would probably expect from a reasonable quality phone camera.Battery is awesome. I've been interacting with this a lot more than my old phone because it's new, and even with my constant fussing around all day, I'm only charging it once every two nights. I'm not watching movies all day or anything, but am actively customizing, installing, texting, trying out new apps, etc.The back is extremely slippery, like it was designed to be a high-performance air hockey puck. If it sits on anything with a slight incline, it starts gliding away by itself -- this includes rubberized surfaces. This is the first phone I've put a case on in the last 5 years, but this phone is small enough that I don't feel put off by a little extra bulk. That case is mostly to keep the phone from floating away on its slippery back.The notification light is in the corner and much more subtle than other phones that I have had, which could be a good or bad thing depending on your preference. I rely pretty heavily on Lightflow color notifications to silently let me know what is going on from across a room or table, so this may take some getting used to.It's kind of annoying to have to either use the wireless charging (which reviews from around the web have referenced can tear the plate out of the phone), or to have to remove the waterproof cover flap every time I need to plug in the USB cable. The flap is held on by a small piece of plastic so that it hangs off the phone during charging. I like to keep phones around for 2 years or so before upgrading, and wouldn't be too surprised if this broke during the usual life of my phones.Overall, a solid purchase that I am quite in love with, and cannot wait for stable alternative ROMs to appear!"
"394572","SONY XPERIA Z3 COMPACT D5803 16GB (FACTORY UNLOCKED) INTERNATIONAL MODEL- WHITE No-Warranty",2,"Was a five, but the side charging plate broke off due to the magnetic charging cable which was made specifically for this phone."

I can usually get about 4 hours of screen on time. Coming from a nexus 5 that could barely get 2.5 that's impressive. D5803 version works great in US on ATT. No problems.

I never considered a Sony before, but an extremely pleased with this. Android skin is well done and not invasive. Feels solid, and it's extremely fast.And the battery life!! I've had two particular days when I tested it to the extreme. One had a 6 hour car ride, with Google Maps navigation running, as well as paying music through bluetooth. Battery used was only 30 for that entire time!The second was a day I forgot to plug in overnight. Woke up at 4am for a trip with under 10%. Put it on extreme pretty save mode, and by 6pm, still had 6% remaining. I've never had a smart phone that could last anywhere near that."

About time! This phone lasts two days easily. My wife is a light user and she keeps it going for four days. During active use with LTE it will last more than five hours. Always without using the power saving modes.The other great quality is the small size. That is up to taste, but large phones are not for everybody.Other design choices I don't agree with. The glass back looks very neat but it is more slippery than you can imagine -it slides down ANY slightly inclined surface. With a transparent silicone case the orange phone still looks very stylish. The finish of the phone is flawless.Waterproofing I think is a gimmick. It will save your skin if the phone takes the occasional dunk, but the plastic covers don't feel robust -only friction keeps them in place. And the covers are very inconvenient to open for charging, so you are forced to buy the magnetic charger -there are good cheap adapters though.The screen is fine -all high end phones have gorgeous screens. The software is not too bloated -not having ATT junk makes a big difference. The phone is very responsive -all modern phones are."

I updated to lollipop right away and tried to googlize my phone as much as possible and they experience is so similar to my old nexus 4. I may not get updates as fast as I use to but I have to say sony has done a better job with the lollipop update on this phone than the did with the nexus 4 or 5, especially the 5 because it has terrible memory leaks, connectivity issues, and random restarts after lollipop. I also love the small size of this phone!Things I don't like. Terrible camera app, and super auto settings. The camera can take nice photos, but it take effort, and I'm still not sure if they're as good as a nexus 5. I think sony put too much effort into cramming pixels onto a small sensor and the end results isn't very good. I also don't like the dialer/contact app sony uses. Its not as pretty or nearly as organized as the dialer on vanilla android. Sony's dialer doesn't have the search feature that as you typed numbers, business names/contacts would show up. I don't understand why sony used their own implementation when its missing features, is ugly, and does nothing unique. This is one app I can't googlize with a visit to the play store."

The design is gorgeous, the camera is excellent, everything just runs perfectly. The battery lasts more than 48h easily with intense use, in days that I don't use it very much I can go 72h without a recharge. The underwater thing really works, the headphones are pretty good and the speakers are also good, I think that they are not great because of the water-resistant revetment but Its not bad at all.For those like me, who like smaller phones, it won't be a disappointment, the cell fits in your hand and you can do pretty much everything using just one hand."

"394608","SONY XPERIA Z3 COMPACT D5803 16GB (FACTORY UNLOCKED) INTERNATIONAL MODEL- WHITE No-Warranty",5,"Overall, this is the best phone I have ever used. Sony gets it and nailed all of the fundamentals. The waterproof camera and PS4 integration are icing on the cake. Note: Sony's bundled software should be removed immediately by installing the Google Now launcher and then disabling all of the bundled widgets and apps you don't want to use - it takes about 5 minutes to fix so this in no way affects my perspective here.AestheticsSony includes a beautiful, beautiful, beautiful live wallpaper that does not draw very much power. The device is completely unassuming so you don't need to worry if traveling with it and it being a giant golden shiny object.CameraI owned an iPhone 6+ before this, camera is as-good or better in favorable lighting situations and nearly as good in the dark. I swam in the ocean with this phone and took videos of Stingrays. The video came out surprisingly decent and the phone didn't break, so there's that.BatteryBest battery in any smart phone I have used in recent years and the best battery I have ever had in a touch-only / full screen phone. The LG Quantum, Blackberry, and AudioVox SMT5600 are comparable but these have tiny screens. For me, typical usage gets me 3-4 days. 3-4 days! Three to four days! On a powerful smart phone (more on that later). Even with the heaviest of heavy usage (surfing the web, playing games, etc) I have zero worries about running out of power.SizePhone feels perfect to me. I was a true believer in the ""phablet"" device category until I owned the 6+ and saw that the button and area above the speaker added giant vertical bezels. The Note II was bearable in the pocket but still could be frustrating to take out of the pocket - this phone sold me though, it's nice to have a big screen. Screen-wise though, this device has a great sized screen for its size. It has a larger screen than an iPhone 5 while remaining smaller and has a screen just .1"" short of the iPhone 6 screen while remaining almost half an inch smaller vertically and a 1/10 an inch smaller in width. The thickness doesn't matter to me, anything thinner than this device becomes difficult for me to hold and I will take the extra 3 days of battery life any day. In short, you don't need a big phone to have a good sized screen.PerformanceMost devices like this (smart phones that are ""smaller"") have performance that is awful, remedial, puny, diminutive. In synthetic benchmarks, this phone can outperform a Samsung Galaxy S5. Boom.UpdatesSony has committed to updating the software at least to Android Lollypop ... but I would expect support to continue into the foreseeable future as Sony seems to be updating their entire line (e.g. Xperia Z1 from 18 months ago) to the latest Android versions. Sony is super developer friendly, offering AOSP builds for their entire line from http://developer.sonymobile.com/knowledge-base/open-source/open-devices. The current developer builds are Lollypop.GamingWorks with a PS4 controller giving you a better controller experience than ANY bluetooth controller on the market. Remote play on PS4 is awesome and looks and sounds as good as you would expect - playable just don't expect to be doing any competitive gaming over it.PriceI paid $500 for my phone, which is about $150-$350 less than a premium smart phone with similar features will cost you.I really hope that more manufacturers start making more phones like this, the balance of performance, camera, size, and battery are perfect."

My first thought was that something in the settings was off, but after running PC Connect to update the software (replace factory defaults with all updates and fixes) it still did not work. I then installed GPS Status app and purged the assistance data as recommended by Sony: open the dialer and dial *#*#7378423#*#*, select Service tests -> GPS -> Purge assistance data and then restart the phone. This did not work either. Last attempt was a hard reset by holding down the power and volume at the same time. Nope, GPS still does not work."
"394612","SONY XPERIA Z3 COMPACT D5803 16GB (FACTORY UNLOCKED) INTERNATIONAL MODEL- WHITE No-Warranty",4,"They are more finicky than I would like. Avoid water, wipe dry if it gets wet. But still the best phone, for me personally, on the market."
"394613","SONY XPERIA Z3 COMPACT D5803 16GB (FACTORY UNLOCKED) INTERNATIONAL MODEL- WHITE No-Warranty",4,"I'm giving it 4 stars only b/c I have owned this D5803 a little more than a month, otherwise 5 stars. I'm very pleased with its performance. Camera is good if you manually set it to 20.7 MP. Not great in low light, but for that you would need Nokia Lumia which has no peers. If you own & don't like daylight picture quality then make sure you have manually set it. The default is 8 MP which is inferior. Great battery life! Fast response. For some reason the screen resists fingerprint marks like nothing I've ever seen. I've worked with hundreds of models and they all attract greasy prints, but not this one. If you are comparing with the Alpha, the Sony is much thicker and heavier but still comes in at a reasonable 129 grams. iPhone 6 is only other phone of this screen size that can compete with Z3 compact & Alpha, but the iPhone is heavier and thicker than both (especially the 6S - it's like a brick compared to the others!).Getting reliable LTE signal on T-Mobile in S. Florida. And having a 128GB memory slot is a real blessing. One thing - in my case, once connected to a WiFi network, when I leave that network I lose all network connectivity unless I turn off Wi-Fi first, and sometimes need to reboot. If I use the setting that allows the phone to ""scan for WiFi networks, even when WiFi is Off"" I will not get network signal. So if you have that issue, just be sure to disable that feature. Good night and luck!"
"394614","SONY XPERIA Z3 COMPACT D5803 16GB (FACTORY UNLOCKED) INTERNATIONAL MODEL- WHITE No-Warranty",4,"the screen is only slightly bigger than the area my thumb can reach. I wanted a small phone and this is just about right. construction is solid and the screen is vivid with a durable screen. I plan on keeping this phone 3-4 years and am happy with the quality feel and dust/water resistant rating for life's mistakes. And in real daily use I get two days out of a battery charge, that is impressive for such a powerful processor. The camera is a nice plus, for me it's lower on my needs but at a dark concert event my phone took better pics than a friends motorola.I am disappointed in the stereo speakers. ring tones are surprisingly quieter than my old samsung brightside dumb phone, with music only having a improved midrange. I suppose its due to the water resistant housing/speakers. I was hoping for natural sound, one can't expect thumping base from a handheld device.p.s. I've had my sony z3 compact just shy of a month. and I highly recommend getting an aftermarket magnetic charging dock, much easier than using a fingernail to flip open the charging port."

"394616","SONY XPERIA Z3 COMPACT D5803 16GB (FACTORY UNLOCKED) INTERNATIONAL MODEL- WHITE No-Warranty",5,"Read many reviews before purchasing, this phone is small but the software and features allow this phone to compete with any modern smartphone today. This phone has amazing battery life and super fluid response for games Web browsing and messaging. Only thing I've noticed is that for my personal usage, I will need to buy a micro SD card to store my Spotify tracks. This is easily the best phone I have owned and I have used Droids, Windows phones and IPhones before.Sony also has a very nice display and speakers packed into this phone. One last selling point for me is that Sony has packed in a magnetic charging port into the side of this phone allowing the user to do away with the bent pins of micro USB cables. While it is a separate purchase to get the magnetic charging cable I went ahead and bought 2 of them for the home and the car. WSKEN makes a model that supports Quick Charge 2.0 through magnetic charging if you're wanting that. Overall 11/10. When this phone breaks, I will definitely be an Xperia buyer from now on."

But Sony, please Sony, why won't you get rid of your ugly skin and embrace stock android? Or at the very least let us root the phone without nuking the camera? While you can choose different themes to get rid of most of the Sony ugliness, you can't uninstall any of their apps. And for the love of god don't even think of rooting the phone to install your own ROM unless you REALLY know what you're doing. If you unlock the bootloader, it will for all intents and purposes ruin the camera. It nukes their custom drivers and puts the camera into a mode that takes pictures that are approximately as good as you would get using a potato."

"394629","SONY XPERIA Z3 COMPACT D5803 16GB (FACTORY UNLOCKED) INTERNATIONAL MODEL- WHITE No-Warranty",5,"This is hands down the best phone if you're looking for something smaller than the 5 inch+ monsters flagships that are on the market today.The only competition on the market is the iPhone 6. So let's do a quick comparison. The Z3 Compact is about the same size as the iPhone 6, weights exactly the same, and has very similar screen in size and resolution. The Z3 has 4 cores running at 2.5 GHz with 2GB of RAM compared to iPhone 6's 2 cores running at 1.4 GHz with 1GB of RAM. Oh and it has a bigger (longer lasting) battery.Most impressive is the camera on the Z3 Compact. It is a 20MP at f/2.0 using a 1/2.3"" chip. And it shoots 4K video (which the iPhone 6 does not do).Oh and it's waterproof! So when you drop it on the men's room floor, you can pick it up and just rinse it off while bystanders gape at you like you're insane. Or when your psycho girlfriend drops it in the pool (ala Taylor Swift ""Blank Space""), as long as you fish it out in less than 30 minutes, you can text her using it and tell her it's over.And here's the kicker: It costs less than half the price of an iPhone 6. I've been a loyal Apple customer for a long time, and bought the first iPad on the day it came out. I'm sorry to say that I'm no longer willing to pay the Apple Tax.This phone works great on AT&T. First make sure you get the D5803 model. Then to get LTE data, you need to add the correct APN setting as instructed here: http://www.att.com/esupport/article.jsp?sid=KB424489&cv=820. You should have no problems. I sure didn't."
"394630","SONY XPERIA Z3 COMPACT D5803 16GB (FACTORY UNLOCKED) INTERNATIONAL MODEL- WHITE No-Warranty",1,"The Z3 compact arrived and everything appears to look like a new device, box, screen cover and packaging.

When you squeeze the phone it flexes and clicks as if it is not tighly assembled3. It does not pass the water test application4. The phone was already configured, and has Chinese timezone and some Chinese app installed.I haven't contacted the seller yet, but I wanted to warn people asap as I think this may be a scam."

It is getting voltage but the phone is not charging. I did put a custom Marshmallow ROM on it. Could it be a software issue? Who knows.The charging cover flap did start to pop out on one side. It's not a big deal since I'm not taking it underwater. Just for those calls in the rain.Otherwise it's perfect. Love everything about the phone. Now I can finally install apps that require 4 core processors.4K video & 20mp photo are very nice. An excellent backup camera.Clear audio/music.1 star less for quality control.Maybe the back cover and sides should be one piece aluminum?Better side compartment cover?Gorilla glass display? (read reviews that had the issue)Which I think and hope it's fixed with Xperia Z5 and Xperia X models.If you going to get this phone. Get some extra tampered glass cover for the display. Maybe rear glass cover & double sided adhesive. Just in-case."
"394633","SONY XPERIA Z3 COMPACT D5803 16GB (FACTORY UNLOCKED) INTERNATIONAL MODEL- WHITE No-Warranty",1,"EDIT: Review changed to one star.After five weeks with this phone, the phone still looking brand new, with no drops or water damage, this phone suddenly stopped working. When plugged in to power, a charging icon will appear for a few seconds, then go dark for ten seconds, and repeat that way, hour after hour. There is no way to turn the phone on. I've used Sony's support (and the PC Companion software), the reset button, all manner of booting described online, but with no success.While looking for help, I found that Sony's support site has a page for this phone, and the most popular thread in that support forum describes this problem. Apparently many other customers have the same problem. I asked Sony if I could pay them to repair the phone, which according to the other users, is either an old battery (from sitting in storage) or a defective motherboard. Sony answered that they no longer have the ability to repair this phone and will get back to me if they ever contract with a third party.My guess is that the magnetic charging port is part of the problem, but whatever the cause, this is the last phone someone should buy without a warranty. I took the gamble and lost, and that's on me, but I'll keep that in mind when I shop for phones in the future.This was, bar none, the worst experience I've ever had with Amazon.com. They deleted my review of a seller and when I asked why, explained that product reviews can't discuss the seller. As I watched, that seller's negative reviews all vanished. Be very careful buying international products from sellers, even if they have 100% positive reviews. It's possible that shady sellers are somehow abusing a complaint process to censor negative experiences. Just to be clear, this isn't the seller I got this phone from, but one that charged me and never sent the phone.----------------------------------------------------------------------------This is a pretty awesome value and a phone that is quite a bit different from most options out there today.The build quality felt great to me and as it's an android phone you probably have a good idea of what you're getting. I'll talk about the things that set this phone apart.The proprietary charging system is merely an option... you can use your normal USB cables if you open the little door on the upper left side of the phone. But the charging cradle is cheap and nifty, and the magnetic cable is a lot easier to fasten to the phone when driving or in the dark than jamming a USB cable in (which I always seem to try upside down the first time). I am disappointed that Sony doesn't include the charger or the proprietary cable. You only get the micro USB and the wall plug that could charge any modern phone.The phone is legit waterproof, and I've tested it. While I don't really plan to swim, I do work outdoors in weather occasionally and now I don't have to worry about the phone. The included headphones are really great and come with multiple earbud sizes, which is great for my tiny ears. They also have a little shirt clip, which is essential if you want to use the phone when jogging. The headphones have a mike and a button, of course, and the call/music quality is great, as expected from a Sony product.The playstation connectivity is terrific and dead simple to operate. I logged in with my Playstation Network info and the phone was able to automatically remote into my PS4 without any further setup. I paired a PS4 controller easily. You can also use the touchscreen, but for games like Dark Souls 3 you're going to want to use the controller. Unfortunately you cannot pair a PS3 controller with the phone. While there are options to use any Android phone to remote play, these require you to send your login information to a third party app, and that's a pretty big security risk and the reason you can see PSN accounts for sale. I'm very pleased with this feature.The phone came with a matte screen cover already slapped on, but with a little peel off ear sticking off the phone. While you're supposed to peel this off and then put your own screen protector on, I snipped off the ear and left the factory cover on. I mention this because it's working extremely well and putting those screen protectors on without bubbles beneath is a huge hassle.You're very limited in your phone case options. I'm using the Ringke Fusion, which is a thin, rubbery case. Because this case leaves the charging door exposed it's a little flimsy on the upper left side of the phone. It's merely good, not great. I also put a Rokform universal mount on the back and I highly recommend that option as you can then mount the phone to your car or bike without suction cups or flimsy clips. It also adds a little structure to the Ringke case, while keeping the phone nice and small.The screen's colors and clarity are awesome. Far beyond what my eyes can decipher. Because the screen is smaller, battery life is great too. I'm getting a little over two days on the phone, and it charges in a couple of hours on the cradle. The performance of the CPU is terrific. Much better than I expected from a phone design that's a year and a half old now. You could pay double the price and get the Z5 compact, but this phone's plenty powerful for even demanding applications. I noticed it gets warm if I play San Andreas, but the phone kept it up for hours with no trouble.I use my phone's camera all the time for work, and this camera is easy to use and takes great pictures. There's a dedicated shutter button that will get the camera app going in about a second, which is very convenient for me.The phone has some nice smart features, such as the option to unlock with a swipe if it's connected to my car's bluetooth or my watch, and to require a more secure login if not. You can get that kind of functionality on any android phone, but it's nice that it's just built in to the Sony version of Marshmallow android (which is the latest iteration, btw). This is also the best android phone I've had for the software environment. Sony has a very light touch on android, and lets you remove almost anything you didn't want. For example, I deleted Facebook before I even put my Sim card in. Other phones won't let you.And lastly, I love the size. I don't miss the huge screen when surfing the web or swyping on the keyboard. Movies still look great. The phone fits in my pocket more easily than the larger phones that dominate the 'nicer' class of smartphones. This is one of the few options for a really well made phone, with good power and a nice camera, that isn't huge. The smaller screen just works a lot better for me in day to day use.It's a huge shame these Xperia phones aren't more popular in the USA because they are exceptional options. I am pleased with the phone but deeply frustrated with Amazon.com and with the first seller I attempted to purchase this phone through (although the seller I eventually used did a good job). Please be very cautious buying this phone or any other phone shipping from China as it is clear to me that Amazon is deleting the majority of negative seller feedback and you are not getting any more security with this purchase than you would from Ebay. I observed my negative seller feedback and other shoppers feedback deleted despite being completely within the norm for earnest seller feedback, but if I go into detail in my product review Amazon will remove the review (I know this because they did this a few days ago). Just be careful. I love the phone itself and the five stars is for the phone and no other aspect of the shopping experience."

But i was waiting for it to arrive to buy the right cover because sometimes there are models alike and you end up with one wrong case and the camera hole in a different place, so 1 week after getting this Sony i stood it up against a photoframe to watch a video without holding it, it slipped on the table till it was completely horizontal and the back got broken, still holds well together but i guess the waterproof feature is out of question with just 1 week of what i've always thought was careful use, it was not a big movement. I guess if this one falls to the floor there will be no phone left. Hope a cover helps a little.**UPDATE: this phone can't be Sony original, i have one month and a half with it, i've been using cover since week 2, and today i took it off to confirm some comments about this phone being refurbished and the back is already in pieces. And i'm careful with my phones, this never had happened to me even with phones i used more than 2 years and i bought a used iphone once and not even with that one.Amazon should put a correct description of this product and the correct price if it's refurbished. And the correct seller too, because it says Sony here, but when you order it appears the seller as ""Lophone"". I think you can call this a FRAUD."

It has great performance, looks very nice, etc. My problem is with the quality of its construction. I take excellent care of my electronics, and this phone wasn't the exception. I bought a protecting case for it, I have never dropped it or hit it, sat on it, put it under pressure inside my pocket, or abused it in any way. Yet, only 4 months after I bought it the headphone jack plug started do get wide for some reason, and soon after it stopped working. I bought a bluetooth headset, which I've been using ever since.But the worse came only a month ago (13 months after purchase). A full vertical sector of the digitizer stopped working, out of nowhere. The screen is in perfect condition, but for whatever reason the touchscreen underneath just isn't working properly anymore. I attached a picture of the hardware test I did, so you can see the size of that sector. There are also pictures of the phone itself, so you can see there is no damage at all.I've also found a number of people complaining of very similar problems in tech support blogs. The display now behaves very erratically all the time, which I find ridiculous, seeing how everyone around me seems to have a samsung with a cracked screen which nonetheless detects their finger with no problem whatsoever.I'm very disappointed, and I have to say, this is the second out of 5 Sony (Sony-Ericsson) phones I've had throughout the past decade, which has malfunctioned within 18 months after purchase, despite how careful I am with them. In this particular case the problem can be solved by buying a new screen, which costs around $50, with the caveat that the phone will no longer be waterproof."
"394646","SONY XPERIA Z3 COMPACT D5803 16GB (FACTORY UNLOCKED) INTERNATIONAL MODEL- WHITE No-Warranty",1,"This phone is far too brittle. One drop from under 3 feet cracked the back; another small fall cracked the screen and made it useless. Several months after the ~$200 in repairs, the phone again fell and got a small crack in the screen that again rendered the touchscreen inoperable.I don't expect this to be a rugged phone but I do expect it to handle everyday wear and tear, including surviving modest falls when it slips from my hand."

I'm honestly too lazy to find out if my unit is defective, but the phone is so good that I don't really care if that's my only issue. I also need to say that since it's an International Unlocked phone, so US buyers should know that it comes with some Vodafone bloatware that you absolutely do not need. It's only annoying when you're on the browser and it'll redirect you to a Vodafone page for reasons I cannot explain. Other than that, the battery life is insane, and I went over one day without needing to charge."

I bought this phone as a replacement for my Xperia E3, though it wasn't my first choice. After much research and comparisons between the Xperia E4g, M4 Aqua, and this phone, The Z3 Compact won my favor to at least try out. Now that i've had the phone for roughly a month, i must say THIS PHONE IS A FRICKING TANK!!!!!Pros-Awesome battery life and charge speed-Great Speaker-Smooth Xperia UI-Phone is a year old with awesome amount of support (from sony and modders)-Custom ROMs (YES!!!!!!!!)-Fast With great amount of storage and ram out the box (i still recommend getting at least a 4gb micro sd just incase.)-WATERPROOF (I Drop Stuff)-SHATTER-PROOF SCREEN (I REALLY Drop Stuff hehe)-LOLLIPOP UPGRADE!!!!!-SIZE 4.6"" (Not into the whole 5 inch screen craze, prefer smaller phones)Cons-Bloatware (like always)-Camera resolution could be betterI practice/teach Parkour and love to have music on me and take pics of areas and people. I needed a phone that would allow that without me having to worry about breaking it (as much) but also need more processing speed/power and storage space for everyday and business applications.......and i couldn't be more pleased, especially after rooting it and adding a cfw!!!! I definitely recommend this phone to anyone because it's worth the price and i honestly feel this is the best Xperia Smartphone to date."

Works well for me - my preference was for a small sized phone that fits in my hands and has a long battery life and decent camera. Had a minor issue with the screen not turning off but a restart resolved that. Right now facing data connectivity issues but I usually restart it or disable/enable data. Still unclear why that happens. Am using t-mobile. The battery lasts me for 2 days on one full charge with regular usage (using wifi nearly the entire day with low brightness). Sleek feel to hold in hand (although I use it with a case). Running low on memory - about 75% (12gb) because I have a lot of pictures (about 600) and some heavy apps like spotify, facebook and messenger."

I explained to their support they are shooting themselves in the foot: I will just overuse their data network for my email & browsing! The other downside is that the Z3 Compact shows up as unknown on your T-Mobile account.The screen is fantastic. Don't let the 720dpi deter you. On a screen this size it is very clear. YouTube plays great with its stereo but quiet speakers. Phone clarity is excellent & loud. The camera at 20+ is great. Sony's built in email is good enough to not to need K-9.

Once in a blue moon the camera will crash and the feed goes black. This occurred twice using the default camera settings not the 4k video recorder. The only way to fix the problem is to do a full reboot. After the camera crashes the phone's temperature rises dramatically.Other: By far, is the best smart phone in the market size to performance ratio. Easily competes with the iPhone 6."

I didn't know what I was doing because there wasn't any instruction so I wasted that factory screen protector. Afterward I realized that you half-peel off the part where it say ""back"" and put it on the screen. Then peel off the rest. Very simple AFTER I messed up. One downside with this phone is if you want to root the phone, you need to unlock the bootloader. You will lose some imaging enhancement Sony use on the phone. I left it the way it is."

"394684","SONY XPERIA Z3 COMPACT D5803 16GB (FACTORY UNLOCKED) INTERNATIONAL MODEL- WHITE No-Warranty",5,"What a beautiful phone seriously. The screen size of an iPhone 6 but only the physical size of an iPhone 5 in your hand!! The design is BEAUTIFUL and I was worried about the side ""rubbers"" before I got them because they might feel cheap but I was wrong.This is every bit of a premium smartphone from Sony you'd expect and the rubber doesn't make it any lesser than Z2 phones I've held. Of course it's loaded with a lot of extra crap from Sony but you can just ignore those.The camera is great with a lot of manual settings if you like that -- but personally after numerous comparisons, I still feel like iPhone 6's (or even iPhone 5's) is slightly better. Maybe that's just cause I am used to seeing the images on those phones, or just the fact that it's so simple to take a photo on iPhone and have it turn out great than to have to tweak all the manual settings.Overall it is what it is, it's an Android phone just too bad I can't get the newest android L on this yet to see how much better it is. You still get a lot more satisfaction out of using an iPhone if you're an iPhone user already but if your'e starting fresh into the smartphone world this is definitely an awesome purchase.NOTEAfter reading other reviews too, i WILL AGREE that the charging dock seems ""necessary"" as you don't want to be opening the flaps every time you want to charge your phone. I also fear overtime it may wear out the flap and make it not water proof any more (my actually went a bit coo coo after dipping it in a cup of water for 5minutes on the 2nd day......so back to my iPhone it is)"

Battery life is great but most everything else sucked. Camera was terrible especially the front one which took horribly grainy photos even in non low light situations. It couldn't take photos underwater because the touch screen wouldn't respond when it was under water. The first one I ordered had been opened and came with a different plug and want the standard American plug or adapter. The next one I got hadn't been opened but also didn't come with an American plug although it had an I'll fitting adapter.The biggest kicker was that i couldn't send or receive MMS messages with this phone on T-Mobile. They sent the issue to their engineering department, we went over the APN settings time and again and they finally figured out it was that this phone couldn't send them for some reason. Couldn't send snapchat photos at first either although that resolved after some updates and restarts to the phone.Thank you to Amazon for having a great return policy because this phone was nothing like the reviews"

With a requirement to travel internationally on occasions, I find the dual sim handset a real bonus to allow me to have a local sim (lower local cost calls and data) and my 'home' sim in one familliar handset along with all my favourite apps and features. I researched the market and the Z3 D6633 was the one which covered the required LTE frequencies in the UK and my most likely destination countries. (There are other model numbers of the Z3 Dual which have more market specific frequencies) I did look at the Z3+ and Z5 Dual, but overheating issues with the Z3+ and perceptably bulkier design on the Z5 encouraged me to try to get hold of one of the few remaining Z3 Dual handsets. After being messed arround by a supplier based in Hong Kong, I found the D6633 on Amazon.com and it was dispatched from the USA and with me in just over a week.Having previously had a Sony Z1 Compact, the Z3 Dual is everything I could have hoped for - great screen, fantastic music with the compatible noise cancelling headphones (at under £30, also from Amazon), build quality etc......If you can still get hold of one of these handsets, just do it - you will not regret it."

Performance is what you'd expect of a flagship in the later half of 2014 so I won't detail that as it's thoroughly reviewed/documented across the interwebs. I will, however, detail my experience with the shortcomings of this phone. Begin...Upon delivery, unwrap and initial inspection, the first first issue became evident. The adhesive tape that Sony used to seal the back glass to the phone is insufficient for the task of waterproofing. It was lifting from the chassis near the bottom of the phone and any attempts to press and reseal were futile at best. So much for the IPX-blah blah rating. As this comes shipped WITHOUT warranty for those of us in the states, I was stuck with trying to figure out how to fix this. Further research into this particular issue yielded a product by the name of Sugru (you'll want to add this to your cart as well if you buy this phone). Ordered, applied carefully, let cure for 24 hours, problem solved... UNTIL the back glass inevitably cracks and warrants a replacement ($8+/- here on Amazon). At this point you then have to pry the cemented glass off with a chisel as the Sugru means business, resulting in many glass splinters and shards everywhere (be sure to wear eye protection and lay down adhesive under your workspace!). I figure the average user will be in need of this operation at least two times a year... or more.This phone is just too slippery and delicate. As previous reviews mention, the thing has a mind of it's own. It's so flat on it's major surfaces that if laid flat it'll slide due to the air pockets it creates between itself and the surface it's laid upon. Who needs a ouija board when your Z3 is possessed from the factory!? You'll be a hit at parties, for sure. And if the surface is anything but level, it'll slide off the edge of the world to a lower center of gravity. If the fall is anything above moderate, the glass WILL crack. Reminds of the radical shift in iPhone design from the 3 to the 4. Don't buy this phone for aesthetics if you plan to put a case on it. That's blasphemous to the design of the phone, but necessary if you want to keep it unscathed for longer than the 6+ months I did.I have since upgraded to the Moto X Pure Edition (2015) as I no longer have a need for dual-SIM functionality and far more satisfied with that phone. Nice job with creating a glamorous, but disappointing phone, Sony. Here's hoping subsequent iterations of the Xperia Z line are more durable and robust."

"395492","Sony Xperia Z3 D6633 Factory Unlocked, International Version, Black",4,"Great phone....at first I was having issues with reception and MMS, but it just needed to be set up on my carrier correctly. However, this thing is WAY to delicate, I have dropped it 3 times, all three were from pants pocket height, first time dented the corner and chipped the glass, the second made the phone freeze up and require a hard reset, the third landed on the top corner and cracked the touch screen down the middle, and unlike other phones that can be used with a cracked screen, this phone's touch screen stopped working on 90% of the screen. Find a good bumper case and you'll love this phone."

From a spec standpoint this stands up to the iPhone 6 with a much better camera. If you are not hooked on iOS, this is a worthy consideration. This is the nicest phone I have owned (Android, iOS, Windows, Apple, HTC, Samsung, BB, Nokia). Updated to Lollipop right after turning it on, so be prepared for an hour(ish) upgrade potentially depending on when you buy it. I travel between Asia and US and the dual SIM is a must and works thoughtlessly on this model.I bought the magnetic charger adapter and that makes charging much easier as you don't have to fumble with a tiny connector. Get the plug close and it is magnetically drawn into place.Update: I took this on vacation in France and I cannot say enough about the camera. In our group, we had people carrying Samsung, HTC and Apple phones and this one consistently took the best pictures in each and every condition."

"395510","Sony Xperia Z3 D6633 Factory Unlocked, International Version, Black",5,"Quick summary: after about 1 month, the phone is great and has exceeded expectations. Below are some details on my experience.The phone came in a package that was not sealed, even thought the description was new. It appeared to have been opened. The phone itself looked to be in new condition so I decided to give it a chance.The pros:1. took it to ATT and all worked just fine with the network2. The phone is super fast, blazing.3. The connection is strong and clear, to the point where I was wondering if the Sony could be this good, or was my old phone just so bad and slow etc.4. The battery is excellent, Sony claims 2 days. I tested it. I went 42 hours with my normal moderate use. I had GPS and wifi on. At 42 hours I had 14% of the battery left and I decided to charge it. So I guess it is possible to get to 48 hrs with no charge esp with light use.5. The size is fine, I was concerned it would be too big. No problem, with one hand you can still comfortably do everything.6. It has dual sim which i intend to use traveling, but have not done that yet, I hope it all works fine.The cons, or at least things that caught the attention:1. As mentioned, the package did come open, not sure why.2. The material said it was made in Hong Kong, but materials were in English and Farsi, a little strange, cannot imagine it was made for the iranian market!?!?3. This model is not sold officially in the US so I still cannot find a case that fits exactly right. I found another Z3 case that fits the phone itself, but not all holes line up. I had to use an exacto knife to enlarge the charging hole. Other than this, the case works ok for now.4. Finally, the Sony software conncetivity suite does not seem that great. I probably will not even use it.5. I read reviews about it being slippery. This is true. The front and back are so fine and smooth that I was always worried about dropping it. It does seem delicate. But one I got the case that concern went away, it seems fine.In sum, the phone is super fast and the battery is really good. I am not a iphone fan and would take this over an iphone any day. Well worth the $620 I paid."
"395511","Sony Xperia Z3 D6633 Factory Unlocked, International Version, Black",1,"this phone is well known for being very fragile. see online reports and other amazon reviews. my phone shattered in first few days with no dropping or other trauma. don't risk this known defect in these Sony phones, pick another,"

After that yesterday i sat with the phone in my back pocket and it broke right in the zone of the power button, and even when the acreen resisted now has a stain near the border and the other border is showing some black lines.

"395521","Sony Xperia Z3 D6633 Factory Unlocked, International Version, Black",3,"I have been using this phone for a few months now - I did not want to write a review until I had used it extensively.The phone has a nice big screen and is bright in daylight, which is nice.The phone is NOT a U.S. model, so the normal Experia case will not fit - order one anyway (because the phone is very slippery) and then expect to take a razor and make a slight modification where the charge port is.Other people have posted reviews about the phone's water-proof-edness, with mixed results - I have NOT submerged my phone in water, or taken it into the pool with me - primarily because it's a cell phone, and that would be retarded - do not take your ""cell phone"" swimming with you - seriously? No phone is ""water proof"" - despite what Sony advertises (now back to the review)The dual sim function is nice (which is why I bought the phone) and the other reason I bought THIS phone is because it is the ONLY flagship android phone that works on AT&T's LTE network ... I did days of research and coordinated with AT&T customer service to make sure I was getting a phone that uses their LTE - and it does. You WILL need to call customer service and have THEM update your carrier settings before it will work and they have to flip some digital switch on their end as well - so don't be frustrated until you jump through their hoopsThe reception on SIM 2 is crappy - no other way around it ... it drops calls (frequently - at least 2-4 times a week, if not more) and that is frustrating. I think the antenna for the SIM cards is pretty crappy at best. I do NOT get the signal strength I did from ANY of my past iPhones, and the antenna for SIM 2 is especially bad - I often have to leave buildings to get good call clarity - which has not been an issue since the early 90's ... ugThe phone call and speakerphone volumes are not good ... rather quiet ... disappointing - I have good hearing, but if I did not, I would throw this phone into the river because it's too quiet (wait - it's ""waterproof"" - I would throw it into hot lava instead).This might sound petty, but to unlock the screen using a pin, you must enter your pin, THEN press the ok button ... on the iPhone, you only had to enter your pin and it would automatically unlock ... so this extra button push is irritatingThe battery does NOT last for 2+ days ... I read a lot of reviews about how great the battery life is - and it definitely lasts all day, but I would never get 2 days out of mine (like, ever).There are also a lot of great reviews about the camera ... and with digital cameras there is a lot of jargon to weed through before you understand what all of those numbers mean - but as a whole, this camera is really no better than my iPhone 5's camera ... it's not strikingly betterIF you're planning to switch your SIM cards in/out on a regular basis, this phone will not be convenient to do that - you have to slide out a fragile tray on the side of the phone and carefully take them in/out ... after a while this tray might break if you're not really carefulOne big disappointment is that you cannot 'assign' which contacts get called/texted with which SIM card ... the phone makes you choose which SIM card EVERY TIME you call/text - this is annoying when you use voice/internet commands to call a number - ie: ""ok google ... call mom..."" - it will NOT just call mom ... it will then make you choose which SIM card to call mom with, and if your phone is locked, it will not call mom at all until you unlock the phone and select which SIM to use ... all of this hassle makes the voice command take just as long as manually calling from a favorites listHope this review helps"

"395527","Sony Xperia Z3 D6633 Factory Unlocked, International Version, Black",3,"I bought a Sony Xperia Z3 (dual SIM) model D6633 phone from Amazon. I received it in a timely manner and have no issues with Amazon concerning the phone or shopping experience..The only oddities are it came with an international plug and lacks a setting for American English, which is not a major problem as the Canadian English setting works well for me and I can easily buy 110 volt plugs that fit U.S. type wall outlets.Most of the time (after finally getting it properly configured) my Xperia D6633 works well with both my U.S. T-Mobile SIM and my Mexican Movistar SIM. Both these carriers offer 4G LTE data in their respective country--and I can get it when my Xperia D6633 is properly configured. (More about that later.)Most dual SIM phones are not 4G LTE capable and most that are 4G LTE capable, unlike the Xperia D6633, are 4G LTE capable on only one of the two SIM chips. I would not buy a phone that is not 4G LTE capable. Because the Xperia D6633 was the only dual SIM phone that I could find that is 4G LTE capable on both SIM chips I think this is the best dual SIM phone on the market at this time; however, I am not happy with the way 4G LTE works on my Xperia--or on any other dual SIM phone as they all share a common problem (described below).For years I carried two phones. I am not sure if switching to a dual SIM phone will (as I hoped) make my life better. Due to the problems detailed below I may go back to carrying two phones. (Or I may switch to a single SIM phone and use Telcel America which has coverage in both the U.S. and Mexico as well as get--from somebody like Keep Calling--a virtual Mexican number for use by my Mexican friends and customers. (I fear, however, this would not provide me the data coverage that is available--if I am willing to jump through the necessary hoops--that having both a US and Mexican 4G LTE capable SIM makes possible.)On the Xperia Z3 model D6633 only one SIM at a time can be used for data coverage and the user manually designates which of the two SIM chips is to provide the data coverage. So every time I cross the border I have to manually change the data setting (unless I want to always be on data roaming in one of the two countries where I use the phone). What I want are ""set and forget"" options. I want to either be able to designate one SIM to always provide data coverage (even when roaming) or to be able to configure the phone so that the data connection will automatically switch to the other SIM when a SIM enters data roaming territory. Without this option I must manually change the data SIM selection every time I cross the border, which is a tiresome experience. (It is possible that my gripe is actually a result of my lack of understanding about how to configure the phone's data connection settings and if so I owe Sony a star. If somebody knows how to do this please post the procedure as I have searched for this information and have not been able to find it and thus do not think it exists.) I am deducting a star for the lack of this option.The Xperia Z3 miniUSB charging port is on the left side of the phone, not at the bottom where it is on most cell phones. I find this makes talking on the phone while it is charging very uncomfortable.Equally annoying is became the charging port is on the side instead of at the bottom a standard Xperia Z3 protective case will not fit the Xperia Z3 model D6633 because both SIM chips as well as the charging port are housed under the charging port cover. This makes the D6633 charging port cover larger than it is on the standard Xperia Z3. The end result is that I have to remove the phone's protective case to charge the phone using a USB cable as well as to remove the protective cover to connect the phone to a computer using a USB cable (because good protective cases made specifically for the D6633 are as hard to find as hen's teeth) if I want to use a protective case. Again, annoyingly, to charge the phone or to connect it to a computer I must either remove the protective case or go without a good, protective case .So that I do not have to remove the protective case every time I want to charge the phone I bought a charging cradle and it works--if one is willing to wait overnight to charge the phone and spend the extra money for a charging cradle. (This problem would not exist if Sony put the charging port on the bottom of the phone as most manufactures do.) I am deducting a star because of the design (1) makes it uncomfortable to talk on the phone while it is charging and (2) makes me either go without a good protective over or remove the protective cover to charge the phone as well as connect it to a computer using a USB cable.Thus far my experience is dual standby dual SIM phones (like the D6633) eat up more battery life than do single SIM phones. The battery life of my Xperia D6633 I would describe as only adequate on a good day. I usually make it through the day without having to charge the phone, which is a far cry from the hype I heard about only having to charge it every two or three days. When it does not make it through the day it starts shutting down things like W-Fi. The problem is what is turned off is not automatically turned back on after the phone is charged. (Which means things like Wi-Fi may not be working without your knowing it.)I mostly use a phone to talk and text; I also spend more time talking on my phone each day than does the average person. Since I am neither a techie nor a power user I will let others comment on features like the camera and GPS as they are features I seldom, if ever, use. The screen resolution is most adequate for my needs, which are less than somebody who says watches Netflix. The same for the speakers as I do not do things like listen to music on my phone, although I do wish the speaker had a little more volume as sometimes I do not hear it ring while driving or when some other loud background noise is present. (A problem that probably has much to do with my hearing as with the phone itself.)If, like me, you are not a techie try to find a person who knows something about dual SIM phones to set it up. After installing SIM1 the phone worked fine, however, the person who installed my SIM2 made some fatal changes to my SIM1 settings. When the person who first installed my SIM1 re-set the SIM1 selections the same thing happened to my SIM2 settings. It took a while to find somebody who understood how to properly configure both SIM chips. (I suggest you make write down all the APN and other such settings after each successful SIM installation.)Some, but not all, options are be configured differently for each SIM. For example, each SIM can be set to use a different ring tone.Be warned that not all apps work with two SIM chips installed. For example, Google Voice can receive incoming calls when two SIM chips are installed, but cannot be used to make outgoing calls when two SIM chips are installed. The text messaging app that comes with the D6633 works with both SIM chips installed, but not the text messaging app that I prefer. Etc. The reason is just before placing a call or sending a text a dialog box appears asking which SIM you want to use. Some apps can handle this interruption, others cannot.I wish Sony would make a comparable Xperia Z3 dual SIM compact phone. I prefer the smaller form factor and although I have adjusted to the larger size I still wish it was available in a smaller size.I am, no doubt, a heavy grader, especially since overall the Xperia D6633 works reasonably well. (However, when I spend $500.00 on something I grumble if I do not get exactly what I want, which is the case with my Xperia Z3 dual SIM phone.) I think the Sony Xperia D6633 is probably the best dual SIM phone on the market; however, I am not sure getting a dual SIM phone was an improvement over carrying two phones."

She finally left it and we tried again, once more the carrier couldn't connect and I called sony, eventually they told me this 'International' version which is unlocked will ONLY work....... In Japan!!!! Great, so a word of warning to anyone buying an unlocked phone, check immediately to see if it is compatible with where you live, I purchased the exact same phone and it connected straight away, no one knows why mine works and hers doesn't.

"395594","Sony Xperia Z3 D6653 16GB (FACTORY UNLOCKED) GSM international model - Copper ""No Warranty""",4,"Great little phone and a good alternative to others.Pros:+ waterproof, dustproof, I wouldn't go diving in it but it helps with the occasional spill.+ android and all of those benefits+ external charging (although yet to be tested by me since I have heard some horror stories)+ nice bright screen+ few android tweaks to help the end user experience (mostly the gesture to just pick up the phone to ear and it will automatically pickup)Cons:- really slick back, it will slip from your hands or something smooth and uneven. Case in point, a smooth glass table that was slightly off level, I could see my phone sliding down.- weak external speaker output- I don't like opening a door everytime to charge and I don't want to use the magnetic charger- obviously a niche phone so not too many accessories- I don't like the camera performance- biggest gripe is the overheating. Yes if you want to shoot some video or camera for extending times, the phone will overheat and shut the application down. That's not cool since this is supposedly a camera centric phone.- due to sealed design, no battery replacementOverall, yes there are some drawbacks but still I like this phone."

(All of the advantages which i agree with are already written in previous reviews)I did have a little trouble getting used to a few annoying stuff, for example: I rearranged my photos in new folders using my phone, and then later i attached my phone to my computer, and all of the folders I created were gone, only the ones i had originally put on my phone through my computer were there. In addition to that, every time i go into my photo library i see all of my photos on my phone unorganized, and i have to click on view in folders every time. One last thing is I highly recommend you apply a glass screen protector immediately as you receive your phone. I only applied the regular screen protector I had received with the phone, and 2 weeks after using it, the screen cracked at the top (no idea how it happened), and then I couldn't use the screen at all above the crack."

But other then the back, I would give it a five, battery life is awesome I play music and game on it with no lag, so my biggest suggestion is buy a case that is water proof and shock proof and make sure its for tye z3 and not the z3v two completely different sizes."

"395639","Sony Xperia Z3 D6653 GSM Cellphone Unlocked, International Version No Warranty, Black",4,"phone is authentic and doesnt have any carriers or networks logo anywhere. just a pure standard xperia z3 that you would find in sony store or any other phone store that carriers sony. one thing though is that i think it was made for china/chinese region so it does contain several chinese apps and couple of functions are in chinese. Neverheless, this phone is unlocked so it will most likely work anywhere. the chinese functions will naturally and automatically change to your prefered language once you put a sim and have the phone working with any network provider. as for the chinese apps, you can just unistall/delete them. the phone is slim, nice and solid looking, wide screen that's great for watching, it has a lot of good features.some cons that i found from z3:-minimal audio volume (if you love listening to music a lot, this could be a big downside. volume doesnt go that high)-not functioning well...or at all, and just freeze when battery is about 5 or 4%-when the phone is using high energy/power to play a video, games, app etc... the backside of the phone heats up-it takes a while for the battery to charge up completely-probably need a camera app to take really good pictures. standard camera doesnt take great photos even if the phone has 20.7 mp"

That is one reason it was returned.The phone was not new as advertised. This seems to be in agreement with other reviews. This phone condition was obvious when we found apps that are not part of standard new phones such as Line ( I have not found this to be standard stock app even in international models). Another give away is the lack of Sony docs. and the stock phone protector seemed to have put as a replacement for the original. We had the chance to compared when we bought another Xperia Z3 model that was really new."

"395684","Sony Xperia Z3 D6653 GSM Cellphone Unlocked, International Version No Warranty, Black",2,"Note: I have had this phone for 3 days.I bought this phone expecting it to be what reviewers and the manufacturer said it would be. Well, i was very dissappointed.First letdown is the speakers. IThe speakers have a very irritating screechy sound if put at a high volume, which doesnt happen with other phones. Second, the camera does not focus well or take moving pictures well. I had the xperia SP, n honestly it took better moving pictures and it was much more simpler. Third, there is a lot of static when it comes to taking pictures. Most of the time, my pictures are filled with ""Static"". Generally speaking, its aa semi-fast processor. I use it for some social media, some pictures and for messaging/calling. Thats all.rate: 4/10.UPDATE: i ordered a replacement and nke that z3 is messed up too. Maybe its the seller selling faulty goods, or just Sony. The replacement disconnects 4g every 2 minutes which is really aggravating. I never had this problem with any other phone.Basically: dont buy this phoneThe good things are the feel, the speed, the battery life, the simplicity."
"395685","Sony Xperia Z3 D6653 GSM Cellphone Unlocked, International Version No Warranty, Black",1,"PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE.I bought 2 and both of them do not work anymore.Reason: Although the Sony Xperia Z3 is waterproof....these phones are not.Both my phones got water in them as we where taking pictures in pool.Now I know why it was written clear...NO WARRANTY."

"395708","Sony Xperia Z3 D6653 GSM Cellphone Unlocked, International Version No Warranty, Black",3,"I loved this phone untill the digitizer broke and it became a brick. I will say it worked ok, not great with t-mobile here in puerto rico. the battery wouldnt last as advertised, probably because it was looking for signal all the time. People said it would bend, and that it would get too hot... personally i didnt experience this. It remained snappy for as long as it worked. Can confirm the amount of megapixel doesnt make a big difference, the pictures looked liked that of any other flagship phone. You have to use a case with this one, its super slippery. My headphone broke after a few months, and would only play music from a precise angle. The display looked very beautiful."

This is not a original Phone, is a very cheap copy of the original with many errors inside. I would'nt recommend it to somebody. I dont think is the Phone, i mean is the supplier Who sell this fake products. The back sheet got broken after two days of use, the screen is blue, there are not real colors when taking a picture, the screen doesnt turn off after some time, it is always on. The battery Last like 4 hours if you send messages or talk. Dont buy it!!"

"395712","Sony Xperia Z3 D6653 GSM Cellphone Unlocked, International Version No Warranty, Black",5,"Received the D6653 from seller Saletagz. Brand new phone, new in box, no issues. Comes with a European/Hong Kong charger and an adapter.I went to an ATT store to get a nano sim and had no problems setting it up. Make sure you ""download Internet settings"" in the connection settings.The phone I received was unlocked with no carrier branding, no extra apps added. Just a brand new truly unlocked phone."

"395714","Sony Xperia Z3 D6653 GSM Cellphone Unlocked, International Version No Warranty, Black",3,"it wasn't 6653, it was 6603 first of all. Also many T-Mobile applications and settings were preloaded and some of them weren't be able to be uninstalled.I had many disappointments about the lies, however the product is as good as expected. Sony Xperia Z3 is the best choice for these days."
"395715","Sony Xperia Z3 D6653 GSM Cellphone Unlocked, International Version No Warranty, Black",5,"really good"
"395716","Sony Xperia Z3 D6653 GSM Cellphone Unlocked, International Version No Warranty, Black",3,"When I received the phone the settings is in Chinese characters and I have to search to my other phone in hiw to.change the language settings of it. I didn't expect that it would turn out like that. I was confused if it's made on China or what. But it's alright I have changed it anyways. The phone arrived at good condition. The earphones is not really good somewhat cheaper. If I we're you buy an earphones."
"395717","Sony Xperia Z3 D6653 GSM Cellphone Unlocked, International Version No Warranty, Black",5,"Amazing phone!The camera is the best phone camera i've ever seen. Shoots practically in the dark, super wide angle, resolution of course is crazy too. Very nice to be able to push a hard button from any position to activate too. Super nice.Being Android 4.4. also allows installation of the google camera with photosphere and a lot of nice processing.Everything else works really good too. The sound is great, the screen is great..... layout is almost barebones android - no annoying bloatware (except a very nice sony walkman). No need to mess with flashing ROMs (i fried a Samsung Note 2 previously installing custom ROM to get rid of the samsung bloatware). Overall - extremely happy with this phone!Note that the 6653 does NOT work with Tmobile's LTE in Boston. Could work in other areas but not sure. If you want Tmobile/ATT LTE it's better to get the 6603 model."
"395718","Sony Xperia Z3 D6653 GSM Cellphone Unlocked, International Version No Warranty, Black",5,"this is a most powerful phone I love the fact that it is water proof ad all these lovely things.it looks expensive with the all glass unibodybattery life so far really is stellascreen is vivid for meYOU HAVE TO BUY A PROPER CASE DON'T RISK BREAKING IT LIKE i DID"
"395719","Sony Xperia Z3 D6653 GSM Cellphone Unlocked, International Version No Warranty, Black",3,"The phone itself is just great, but when I got the package the phone box was not sealed and it turned out that the charger was for UK, so the store added a big adapter, and the worse was that the headphones inside the box didn't correspond with the ones that are showed in the publicity. Good product, good for Sony, but bad store to buy."

"395736","Sony Xperia Z3 D6653 GSM Cellphone Unlocked, International Version No Warranty, Black",3,"The Xperia Z3 is a great phone. That said, the handset I received seemed to have WiFi completely broken. That is, Not only would the WiFi slider just hang when switched to ""on"", but when I went to look up the MAC address, it said ""unknown"" almost as if the kernel driver, or possibly the WiFi hardware itself was missing.Also, as other buyers have noted, this international model lacks the necessary LTE bands for AT&T, and will only negotiate at HSPA."

"395743","Sony Xperia Z3 D6653 GSM Cellphone Unlocked, International Version No Warranty, Black",4,"This has been a great phone. The only problem I've thus far, after about four months of use is that Sygic Navigation refuses to work on this phone! Which I previously purchased and used often. I realize that the problem is most likely on the end of sygic, however it's the only app I have had any trouble with. It's also the only issue I've had with sygic after years of use."

"395745","Sony Xperia Z3 D6653 GSM Cellphone Unlocked, International Version No Warranty, Black",1,"It was a decent phone but only lasted one year. The USB failed one month after warranty expired, now I can only charge it using the charging base. The base is a very difficult to use due to its own connection problems and is yet one more accessory I need to pack with travelling.After doing some research this appears to be a common problem with Sony phones. Last Sony product for me."
"395746","Sony Xperia Z3 D6653 GSM Cellphone Unlocked, International Version No Warranty, Black",3,"Beware because it does not have band 4 and some (most) wireless providers 4G/LTE will not work, only 3G"

I touched put the phone in dry rice Soak the moisture.

I bought this phone which appear to be working fine after two weeks, the screen breaks with no impact and half the screen does not respond to touch anymore."
"395755","Sony Xperia Z3 D6653 GSM Cellphone Unlocked, International Version No Warranty, Black",1,"There's a problem with the microphone. From the first day we had it, people I called were noticing the issue. Whether I'm using an app or the phone , everyone says that I sound muffled--it sounds like I have my face pressed against something, or I'm speaking through something over the microphone. Even holding the phone a few inches away from me doesn't help. I've heard it myself and can tell that the microphone on my phone is rather unclear. I've made sure it wasn't a connection issue. Again, this was a noticeable problem from the first day we had it.The speakers work fine, so I am able to hear the other end of the call perfectly fine, but calling has become nearly impossible now unless I use an external microphone, be it through the earphones that came with the phone or otherwise - the microphone is still an issue even when the call is on speakerphone."
"395756","Sony Xperia Z3 D6653 GSM Cellphone Unlocked, International Version No Warranty, Black",1,"Product does not work. When brought to Sony official repair location, we were told that the repair is not possible because the item was tampered with and resold. Do not trust this seller.

"395759","Sony Xperia Z3 D6653 GSM Cellphone Unlocked, International Version No Warranty, Black",1,"I bought and received this phone in the beginnig of May of this year. So I've had it now for 2 months. I like to carry my phone in my back jeans pocket. Thats how the front screen got cracked. Shortly after that I accidentally dropped my phone about 30 inches when lying on my bed. It landed on top of a book which was laying next to me. That resulted in the back of the phone completely ruined. The phone does not work anymore, except for certain occasions only, when it's in the mood. Other than that I'm phoneless.Worst choice of phone I ever made. Sony never again. Sorry."

"395761","Sony Xperia Z3 D6653 GSM Cellphone Unlocked, International Version No Warranty, Black",1,"It's not the D6653, It's D6603.d6603 works in Chile, but the problem I had was that this particular phone does NOT work signal of 3G and 4G, only 2G.. I went to Sony customer service and they opened it, they discover that the BATTERY was not original, it showed that the battery was used before , the back cover of the phone was thinner than a original Z3 cover..Conclusion, this smartphone is a REFURBISHED cell phone, the battery is not original, and the back case is not original as well.Do not buy this phone if you live in Latin america, the battery life will drain faster, and you will get insane trying to fix the 3G and 4G, the seller should tell that this phone is not original, and has all that cons that I said before."

"395763","Sony Xperia Z3 D6653 GSM Cellphone Unlocked, International Version No Warranty, Black",1,"I purchased this phone because I was moving out of country and wanted an unlocked phone. When it arrived I could not put a sim card into it because the tray that the sim card sits it was missing. I waited on Sony for more than 8 weeks to replace that part. During that time I used the phone exclusively on WiFi and it performed great. When my service was finally fulfilled by Sony I plugged in my sim card in my new fancy tray and it would not connect to any mobile network. Tried factory reset; nothing. Reset software; nothing. It is here I found out that the phone itself was defective I went back to Sony for repair/replacement and was rejected because no Sony phones manufactured in France are covered in their current warranty programs for this model. This may all be bad luck. I missed the warranty policy change by two weeks(waiting for the tray...) I may have purchased a lemon, but buyer beware."

This phone is just as elagent and sleek as the iPhone with waterproof rating. One initial disappointing feeling was this particular model doesn't support 4g on the At&t network but after battle testing it for a couple weeks I have found it is just as fast. It takes great pictures in and out of water with tons of cool editing and and customizing features. Battery life is unbelievable. Having had tons of phones over the past few years,this is the best so far. Keep it up Sony."

"395780","Sony Xperia Z3 D6653 GSM Cellphone Unlocked, International Version No Warranty, Black",5,"Hello Guys in this short review I try to summarize all good and bad things about this phone. First of all the OS android updates up to 5.1.1 so it stays up to date. The Software is OK although there is again some bloatware but at least you can uninstall it. One Missing feature is definitely a taskmaster for resources and uninstalling of programs. The Hardware is really good the processor and graphic card areable to show high-quality without any large. The camera makes good photos but with bad light or too long photos the background turns uncolored. The battery can be used for 5 hours of gaming and one day or more if you Just use texting programs. The Speakers are okay but not as good as the from the HTC one m9. The buttons are good placed and easy to reach and one hand use isnt difficult. Nice feature: you can open the camera with locked phone if u need to make a few photos fast. This shouldn't be a professional review because that's what newspapers are for but at least I can recommend it especially because it's good p/l relation.

"395790","Sony Xperia Z3 D6653 GSM Cellphone Unlocked, International Version No Warranty, Black",2,"Note: I have had this phone for 3 days.I bought this phone expecting it to be what reviewers and the manufacturer said it would be. Well, i was very dissappointed.First letdown is the speakers. IThe speakers have a very irritating screechy sound if put at a high volume, which doesnt happen with other phones. Second, the camera does not focus well or take moving pictures well. I had the xperia SP, n honestly it took better moving pictures and it was much more simpler. Third, there is a lot of static when it comes to taking pictures. Most of the time, my pictures are filled with ""Static"". Generally speaking, its aa semi-fast processor. I use it for some social media, some pictures and for messaging/calling. Thats all.rate: 4/10.UPDATE: i ordered a replacement and nke that z3 is messed up too. Maybe its the seller selling faulty goods, or just Sony. The replacement disconnects 4g every 2 minutes which is really aggravating. I never had this problem with any other phone.Basically: dont buy this phoneThe good things are the feel, the speed, the battery life, the simplicity."

"395835","Sony Xperia Z3 D6653 GSM Cellphone Unlocked, International Version No Warranty, Black",4,"phone is authentic and doesnt have any carriers or networks logo anywhere. just a pure standard xperia z3 that you would find in sony store or any other phone store that carriers sony. one thing though is that i think it was made for china/chinese region so it does contain several chinese apps and couple of functions are in chinese. Neverheless, this phone is unlocked so it will most likely work anywhere. the chinese functions will naturally and automatically change to your prefered language once you put a sim and have the phone working with any network provider. as for the chinese apps, you can just unistall/delete them. the phone is slim, nice and solid looking, wide screen that's great for watching, it has a lot of good features.some cons that i found from z3:-minimal audio volume (if you love listening to music a lot, this could be a big downside. volume doesnt go that high)-not functioning well...or at all, and just freeze when battery is about 5 or 4%-when the phone is using high energy/power to play a video, games, app etc... the backside of the phone heats up-it takes a while for the battery to charge up completely-probably need a camera app to take really good pictures. standard camera doesnt take great photos even if the phone has 20.7 mp"

The overall build of the phone is awesome as well, with it's smooth edges and large screen the phone will stand out among the iPhone 6 plus. I have my phone paired with a Moto360 smartwatch and my car most of the day and it has hardly any impact on the phones battery.The camera is also fantastic with amazing photos and great sound and video it makes taking pictures of cars and doing videos of the a snap.The processors on this phone also keep it ahead of the game, everything loads fast and efficient on the phone and even as I switch back and forth with apps it keeps it all a breeze."

"395853","Sony Xperia Z3 D6653 GSM Cellphone Unlocked, International Version No Warranty, Black",5,"The seller was awesome and delivered the exactly on time. The sony mobile box did not cover up with any plastic covers and it was completely opened. But there was a seal or sticker which has sticked on the box and it mentioned that do not open the box if the seal is broken. I am not sure whether this sticker was from Sony or the seller.The phone is awesome and I love sony very much. I had xperia S before and I upgraded now with this phone and I really satisfied with my purchase. Picture and Video quality is awesome and it is same like DSLR. I am finding some difficulties while listening others voice in the calls. But I am not sure that might be the default setting on the phone."
"395854","Sony Xperia Z3 D6653 GSM Cellphone Unlocked, International Version No Warranty, Black",5,"I received Z3v instead of Z3. I have to say the phone was perfect, expect it wasn't the one that I want. The dealer said he will settle it by refunding 80$. So I paid 395$ and got Z3v. It does have few issues like thr Hotspot doesn't work cos it is connected to Verizon. Couldn't update to lollipop although Sony have released it months ago in all Z series and it doesn't connect with PC companion because of again it's Verizon connection. Overall I wished I have had what I ordered but still not bad."

That is one reason it was returned.The phone was not new as advertised. This seems to be in agreement with other reviews. This phone condition was obvious when we found apps that are not part of standard new phones such as Line ( I have not found this to be standard stock app even in international models). Another give away is the lack of Sony docs. and the stock phone protector seemed to have put as a replacement for the original. We had the chance to compared when we bought another Xperia Z3 model that was really new."

"395984","Sony Xperia Z3 Plus E6533 32GB Black Dual Sim Unlocked International GSM model - No Warranty",3,"While the specs look good in paper/theory, the real life performance was disappointing.1. Camera: First let down was the camera. It is hard to believe the megapixel count on the camera. All the pics I took exhibited water color effect with lack of detail, over-saturation with HDR. The front camera took selfies which are grainy. Even the video quality was quite bad. (Check the camera reviews on C4 or M4, the Samsung S3 camera is better than this)2. Screen: 2nd let down is the screen, I may be spoiled by Samsung (previous phone was a s6 edge which I dropped and damaged) but the colors are very washed out, the brightness is not enough for use in sunlight here in Dallas Texas. I have liked LG G3, G4, Moto X pure screens not that I am completely partial to Samsung. But this screen is pure bad even BLU phones have better display. (Go to bestbuy and check out the C4 display you will know)3. Performance: With SD 810 processor and 3 gigs of ram, did not experience any abnormal heating issue (while using gps etc did get a little warm and the glass back made it hard to hold but not a problem if you have a case) or lags. The Sony UI is very clean and close to stock android.4. Software: Upgraded to Android 6.0 and there was no root available for it on xda.5. Battery Life: Battery life was good to OK, better than S6 edge but not as good as the S6 active. Little less than a Note 5 or Nexus 6pFeatures that are unique that made me buy this phone: Dual SIM, 3GB RAM. SD810, waterproof,NFC, 5.2 inch 1080p screen, 21 mpx camera.But the screen and camera alone was a bummer. With this phone there is no wow factor like when I got when I bough the S6 edge."

"395986","Sony Xperia Z3 Plus E6533 32GB Black Dual Sim Unlocked International GSM model - No Warranty",1,"Bought 4. All of them came with supiciuos preinstalled glass protection. One of them for each family member (wife, me and sons). I came to the Z3+ in order to have all of my chargers standarized. My Z3 were a complete frustration about the magnetic conector (2 of them failed), but I still liked Sony for having a nice Android implementation. Also wanted to be conected with all my family during my stay in USA, so i decided for dual sim version. Two phones of the four I have bought have the touchscreen broken. I have realized of that as one of them stopped working properly after twoo weeks. In the past one dual sim Z3 supiciusly failed after trying to get photos of my daghter in the pool. Now, I have lose all confidence in dual sim versions selled on AMAZON with ""no warranty"". In the last twoo years 4 of the six phones I have bought failed (twoo Z3 and twoo Z3+). This has triggered the wish to move all family to iphones next year.Update: 3 of 4 Z3+ hace touchscreen broken!"

And after that T-mobile date works at full speed, with LTE and everything.I saw comments that the phone is heating alot, that is not really true, i had Z1 and Z3 before, it is not getting any hotter than the previous ones. Of course if you leave it in the sun, in a summer day in Las Vegas, it will get hot, but since it is waterproof in that case i just put it under running water, or go swimming with it at a pool to cool it down :) very convenient and effective."
"395999","Sony Xperia Z3 Plus E6533 32GB Black Dual Sim Unlocked International GSM model - No Warranty",4,"So I purchased this one from Perfect Trading Inc, and it arrived in a seal pack condition. Though I had to waste half an hour to set up as it came in with all defaults set and that too in some Chinese language. Therefore I had to find my way through language settings and then restored it. Doing that allowed me to get to all the initial settings as it should prompt for when you turn it on for the first time. Along with this the charger that came with it was European plug. The nice thing about this was it came pre-installed with screen protector. Plus it also had Sony ear-phones in the box. Also to all who are curious; Yes it does HEAT a lot and drains battery heavily. In order to take care of the heating issue, Sony has disabled 2 cores of CPU in the OTA update, hence making it very similar to SnapDragon 805 and 801. But the heating issue is still there after the update as well."

"396024","Sony Xperia Z3 Plus E6533 32GB Black Dual Sim Unlocked International GSM model - No Warranty",5,"TL;DR Buy this one only if you understand its shortcomings. Apart from general heating and unreliable focusing It's a great allrounder and makes all sense in the world to pick up last year's flagship for $300 from a reputed brand like Sony. You save nearly $400 if you are planning to buy todays flagship devices.I lost my phone in a car . The dishonest driver did not honor any of my requests to get my phone back . I was looking for a phone under $300 with good performance, screen and camera. I had to choose between NextBit Robin, Nexus 5x, OnePlus 2 and Moto G phones. Being a silent admirer for Sony products since childhood(Make no mistake, I have a Sony arsenal in my camera bag) I slipped into this deal on Amazon and immediately ordered one. I knew the shortcomings of this phone as it comes from the batch of products that were let down my Snapdragon 810 processor. I still took a chance for the price at which it was offered for.Initial impression during unboxingThe phone was solidThe phone looked beautiful and glossy. It had a preinstalled screen protectorThe copper color mitigated the smudges and dust .The box came with a travelling adaptor for US, a set of headphones with mic(I can't speak if it's an original one or a counter fake)A charging cable and no warranty papers.During Initial setupSince it was an international version, it came with Chinese language by default. It didn't take much time to set it back to English.The phone was getting very warm during the initial setup. All the phones including iPhones tend to get warmer during the setup.There were bunch of updates from Sony that was waiting to be installed and I updated them immediately.After the setup that took almost an hour, I restarted the phone. The phone felt less hot and snappierAfter few days of useThe phone that runs on Marshmallow, still tends to get warmer on the back even during normal browsing. Do no use without a case if you feel uncomfortable with its heating issue.The good part is that it gets cooler very fast.All the apps worked flawlesslyThere was only one instance of random reboot while watching a video on Facebook. (Facebook's new app has a history of being little mischievous with resources)The phone is surprisingly cool when on Youtube.The default email app and calendar app has been tuned to be more modern and usefulThe Sony lifelog app is stellar if you are into fitnessThe device as a music player which is decent. The sound quality is also good on headphones if not great.It also comes with FM radio, that is quite surprising during these days where flagships generally avoid themBattery performanceThe battery performance is not stellar. It can get you through a day very easilyThe charging time with the bundled adapter is slowPhone does not feel warm during chargingPerformancePerformance is good.You will never have issue with performance even after the CPU gets throttled after getting warmer3GB of RAM is adequate for a normal person day to day use.Snapdragon 810 does not disappoint in performance .Call quality, 4G , Wifi receptions has been good with no issues till now.DisplayDisplay is decent.It's easily visible under sunlightBeing an LCD screen. it does not wow you immediately. But you will start appreciating it over time for its subtle, natural, neutral color and temperatureTurn off the X-reality engine in Display settings to save some battery. I didn't find this much useful.CameraThis one is not as reliable as iPhone or Samsung camera.When it works properly, you get a great shot.You need to be patient to understand its shortcomings and learn to use it.It can produce great detailed photos.Sample Shot:[...]The manual mode is limited and may not please EnthusiastsVerdictKnow its shortcomings, understand the price at which its offered , you will not be dissapointedI use this phone withPThink® 2.5D Round Edge 0.3mm Ultra Slim Nano Tempered Glass Screen Protector for Sony Xperia Z3+ (Z3 Plus) (Not for Z3) with 9H Hardness/Anti-scratch/Fingerprint resistant (Sony Xperia Z3+)Xperia Z3+ Case - Ringke FUSION ***All New Dust Cap & Drop Protection*** [Free Screen Protector&Back Film][SMOKE BLACK] Premium Crystal Clear Back Shock Absorption Bumper Hard Case for Sony Xperia Z3+ / Z3 Plus (Not for Z3 / Z3 Compact / Z3 Dual / Z3v / Z3 Tablet) - Eco/DIY Package"

It overheats so much that camera is not stable and will turn off after 1-2 mins of video recording, same for other serious products.

"396049","Sony Xperia Z3 Plus E6533 32GB Black Dual Sim Unlocked International GSM model - No Warranty",5,"I love the new Sony Z3+. I've been an iPhone user since 2007 when the first one came out. So, I was skeptical switching to Androids OS. Sony has done a great job of keeping things relatively simply UI wise. From comparing it with my friends Nexus which runs Stock Android, Sony hasn't strayed far away from Stock Android. Functionally, it does everything mostly the same as a stock system with a few added touches, that are well integrated. It does come with some bloatware but its non-invasive to the user experience, other than taking up some internal memory, which is easily compensated for with a good size micro SD card. I can do everything, multi-tasking is easy, it runs smoothly. The User Interface is very clean looking. Its aesthetically pleasing, well organized and doesn't look cluttered with a bunch of things. The clean looking interface is something i noticed was very different from Samsung's touchwiz, something I noticed when I had a chance to play around with a friends Galaxy S5 and was deciding on a new smartphone to purchase . Touchwiz on the S5 was quite cluttered and the theme wasn't as aesthetically pleasing to me. It was more of an eyesore despite the fact that I love OLED technology and Samsung is the only one using the display tech, the theme/skin just isn't nice too look at. Sony still has a much better grasp on design and aesthetics than its Korean revival. Another plus, great images underwater. The camera is absolutely fantastic. For most the camera could be hard to use because its Auto mode may not be the best, though not bad, it could be better. In Manual Mode this camera outshines the iPhone for sure. I can't speak on other phone cameras but i trust Sony to put the best sensor in their Phone. After all, they make almost all the sensors for iPhone and other smartphone companies. And Sony makes fantastics cameras, DSLRs and snap and shoots. They are also, creating image sensors for medical use and their cameras are the most used in the Professional Filming industry. All that technology is packed into this small little smartphone camera and it works wonderfully (other than the heating issue associated with Qualcomm's snapdragon 810 chipset)In regards to the over heating issue. It isn't as bad as some make it seem. it really only shows problems when using the AR modes and 4k on the camera app. Which is unfortunate because 4k is great and the AR modes are quite fun to use. Overall though, it heats up just like any other phone does when it comes to multitasking, long phone calls, or running heavy apps such as games with intensive graphics and waze. But it isn't bothersome. I remember all these things would cause my iPhone to get pretty hot. So, its not really an issue. I guess it does get a bit hotter than some other phones but I can't really blame Sony. At least they owned up to the fact that it does get hot and are trying to address the issue. Qualcomm the maker of the chipset won't even own up to the problem which is affecting Sony, HTC, LG and couple other flagship models. Shame on Qualcomm for ignoring their customers. If overheating is deterring you from buying this phone, be aware that the Samsung S6 is also suffering from heating issues. Just look up ""Samsung S6 heating up"" in google. The issue gets overlooked because Samsung is selling so many phones that google doesn't show the bad stuff first, Just like yelp doesn't show you the recent bad reviews of a restaurant unless refine the search to do so. HTC M9 is also heating up. This problem isn't only associated with Sony.Other than the heating issues when using the Camera Apps 4k mode and AR mode, everything else works great and I love it. Give Sony a shot if you are looking to try Android or want to buy a new Android that isn't the usual HTC, Samsung or LG."

"396111","Sony Xperia Z3 Plus E6533 32GB White Dual Sim Unlocked International GSM model - No Warranty",5,"I love the new Sony Z3+. I've been an iPhone user since 2007 when the first one came out. So, I was skeptical switching to Androids OS. Sony has done a great job of keeping things relatively simply UI wise. From comparing it with my friends Nexus which runs Stock Android, Sony hasn't strayed far away from Stock Android. Functionally, it does everything mostly the same as a stock system with a few added touches, that are well integrated. It does come with some bloatware but its non-invasive to the user experience, other than taking up some internal memory, which is easily compensated for with a good size micro SD card. I can do everything, multi-tasking is easy, it runs smoothly. The User Interface is very clean looking. Its aesthetically pleasing, well organized and doesn't look cluttered with a bunch of things. The clean looking interface is something i noticed was very different from Samsung's touchwiz, something I noticed when I had a chance to play around with a friends Galaxy S5 and was deciding on a new smartphone to purchase . Touchwiz on the S5 was quite cluttered and the theme wasn't as aesthetically pleasing to me. It was more of an eyesore despite the fact that I love OLED technology and Samsung is the only one using the display tech, the theme/skin just isn't nice too look at. Sony still has a much better grasp on design and aesthetics than its Korean revival. Another plus, great images underwater. The camera is absolutely fantastic. For most the camera could be hard to use because its Auto mode may not be the best, though not bad, it could be better. In Manual Mode this camera outshines the iPhone for sure. I can't speak on other phone cameras but i trust Sony to put the best sensor in their Phone. After all, they make almost all the sensors for iPhone and other smartphone companies. And Sony makes fantastics cameras, DSLRs and snap and shoots. They are also, creating image sensors for medical use and their cameras are the most used in the Professional Filming industry. All that technology is packed into this small little smartphone camera and it works wonderfully (other than the heating issue associated with Qualcomm's snapdragon 810 chipset)In regards to the over heating issue. It isn't as bad as some make it seem. it really only shows problems when using the AR modes and 4k on the camera app. Which is unfortunate because 4k is great and the AR modes are quite fun to use. Overall though, it heats up just like any other phone does when it comes to multitasking, long phone calls, or running heavy apps such as games with intensive graphics and waze. But it isn't bothersome. I remember all these things would cause my iPhone to get pretty hot. So, its not really an issue. I guess it does get a bit hotter than some other phones but I can't really blame Sony. At least they owned up to the fact that it does get hot and are trying to address the issue. Qualcomm the maker of the chipset won't even own up to the problem which is affecting Sony, HTC, LG and couple other flagship models. Shame on Qualcomm for ignoring their customers. If overheating is deterring you from buying this phone, be aware that the Samsung S6 is also suffering from heating issues. Just look up ""Samsung S6 heating up"" in google. The issue gets overlooked because Samsung is selling so many phones that google doesn't show the bad stuff first, Just like yelp doesn't show you the recent bad reviews of a restaurant unless refine the search to do so. HTC M9 is also heating up. This problem isn't only associated with Sony.Other than the heating issues when using the Camera Apps 4k mode and AR mode, everything else works great and I love it. Give Sony a shot if you are looking to try Android or want to buy a new Android that isn't the usual HTC, Samsung or LG."
"396112","Sony Xperia Z3 Plus E6533 32GB White Dual Sim Unlocked International GSM model - No Warranty",1,"I bought it without checking different forums, as my wife owns Z1 which is perfect device.As soon as I turned on the phone it started to heat. I was suprized, as it was absoutely uncomfortable for top level of device. After few research I discovered that overheat - is a critical issue for sony Z3+. It overheats so much that camera is not stable and will turn off after 1-2 mins of video recording, same for other serious products. To keep device in your hand is not comfortable because it is becoming hot everytime you load any middle application.Design is perfect but the phone is just for calling, it speed components can't be used because of overheat.

You save nearly $400 if you are planning to buy todays flagship devices.I lost my phone in a car . The dishonest driver did not honor any of my requests to get my phone back . I was looking for a phone under $300 with good performance, screen and camera. I had to choose between NextBit Robin, Nexus 5x, OnePlus 2 and Moto G phones. Being a silent admirer for Sony products since childhood(Make no mistake, I have a Sony arsenal in my camera bag) I slipped into this deal on Amazon and immediately ordered one. I knew the shortcomings of this phone as it comes from the batch of products that were let down my Snapdragon 810 processor. I still took a chance for the price at which it was offered for.Initial impression during unboxingThe phone was solidThe phone looked beautiful and glossy. It had a preinstalled screen protectorThe copper color mitigated the smudges and dust .The box came with a travelling adaptor for US, a set of headphones with mic(I can't speak if it's an original one or a counter fake)A charging cable and no warranty papers.During Initial setupSince it was an international version, it came with Chinese language by default. It didn't take much time to set it back to English.The phone was getting very warm during the initial setup. All the phones including iPhones tend to get warmer during the setup.There were bunch of updates from Sony that was waiting to be installed and I updated them immediately.After the setup that took almost an hour, I restarted the phone. The phone felt less hot and snappierAfter few days of useThe phone that runs on Marshmallow, still tends to get warmer on the back even during normal browsing. Do no use without a case if you feel uncomfortable with its heating issue.The good part is that it gets cooler very fast.All the apps worked flawlesslyThere was only one instance of random reboot while watching a video on Facebook. (Facebook's new app has a history of being little mischievous with resources)The phone is surprisingly cool when on Youtube.The default email app and calendar app has been tuned to be more modern and usefulThe Sony lifelog app is stellar if you are into fitnessThe device as a music player which is decent. The sound quality is also good on headphones if not great.It also comes with FM radio, that is quite surprising during these days where flagships generally avoid themBattery performanceThe battery performance is not stellar. It can get you through a day very easilyThe charging time with the bundled adapter is slowPhone does not feel warm during chargingPerformancePerformance is good.You will never have issue with performance even after the CPU gets throttled after getting warmer3GB of RAM is adequate for a normal person day to day use.Snapdragon 810 does not disappoint in performance .Call quality, 4G , Wifi receptions has been good with no issues till now.DisplayDisplay is decent.It's easily visible under sunlightBeing an LCD screen. it does not wow you immediately. But you will start appreciating it over time for its subtle, natural, neutral color and temperatureTurn off the X-reality engine in Display settings to save some battery. I didn't find this much useful.CameraThis one is not as reliable as iPhone or Samsung camera.When it works properly, you get a great shot.You need to be patient to understand its shortcomings and learn to use it.It can produce great detailed photos.Sample Shot:[...]The manual mode is limited and may not please EnthusiastsVerdictKnow its shortcomings, understand the price at which its offered , you will not be dissapointedI use this phone withPThink® 2.5D Round Edge 0.3mm Ultra Slim Nano Tempered Glass Screen Protector for Sony Xperia Z3+ (Z3 Plus) (Not for Z3) with 9H Hardness/Anti-scratch/Fingerprint resistant (Sony Xperia Z3+)Xperia Z3+ Case - Ringke FUSION ***All New Dust Cap & Drop Protection*** [Free Screen Protector&Back Film][SMOKE BLACK] Premium Crystal Clear Back Shock Absorption Bumper Hard Case for Sony Xperia Z3+ / Z3 Plus (Not for Z3 / Z3 Compact / Z3 Dual / Z3v / Z3 Tablet) - Eco/DIY Package"

And after that T-mobile date works at full speed, with LTE and everything.I saw comments that the phone is heating alot, that is not really true, i had Z1 and Z3 before, it is not getting any hotter than the previous ones. Of course if you leave it in the sun, in a summer day in Las Vegas, it will get hot, but since it is waterproof in that case i just put it under running water, or go swimming with it at a pool to cool it down :) very convenient and effective."
"396167","Sony Xperia Z3 Plus E6533 32GB White Dual Sim Unlocked International GSM model - No Warranty",4,"So I purchased this one from Perfect Trading Inc, and it arrived in a seal pack condition. Though I had to waste half an hour to set up as it came in with all defaults set and that too in some Chinese language. Therefore I had to find my way through language settings and then restored it. Doing that allowed me to get to all the initial settings as it should prompt for when you turn it on for the first time. Along with this the charger that came with it was European plug. The nice thing about this was it came pre-installed with screen protector. Plus it also had Sony ear-phones in the box. Also to all who are curious; Yes it does HEAT a lot and drains battery heavily. In order to take care of the heating issue, Sony has disabled 2 cores of CPU in the OTA update, hence making it very similar to SnapDragon 805 and 801. But the heating issue is still there after the update as well."

I was suprized, as it was absoutely uncomfortable for top level of device. After few research I discovered that overheat - is a critical issue for sony Z3+. It overheats so much that camera is not stable and will turn off after 1-2 mins of video recording, same for other serious products. To keep device in your hand is not comfortable because it is becoming hot everytime you load any middle application.Design is perfect but the phone is just for calling, it speed components can't be used because of overheat. No Sony phones in the future."

Camera: First let down was the camera. It is hard to believe the megapixel count on the camera. All the pics I took exhibited water color effect with lack of detail, over-saturation with HDR. The front camera took selfies which are grainy. Even the video quality was quite bad. (Check the camera reviews on C4 or M4, the Samsung S3 camera is better than this)2. Screen: 2nd let down is the screen, I may be spoiled by Samsung (previous phone was a s6 edge which I dropped and damaged) but the colors are very washed out, the brightness is not enough for use in sunlight here in Dallas Texas. I have liked LG G3, G4, Moto X pure screens not that I am completely partial to Samsung. But this screen is pure bad even BLU phones have better display. (Go to bestbuy and check out the C4 display you will know)3. Performance: With SD 810 processor and 3 gigs of ram, did not experience any abnormal heating issue (while using gps etc did get a little warm and the glass back made it hard to hold but not a problem if you have a case) or lags. The Sony UI is very clean and close to stock android.4. Software: Upgraded to Android 6.0 and there was no root available for it on xda.5. Battery Life: Battery life was good to OK, better than S6 edge but not as good as the S6 active. Little less than a Note 5 or Nexus 6pFeatures that are unique that made me buy this phone: Dual SIM, 3GB RAM. SD810, waterproof,NFC, 5.2 inch 1080p screen, 21 mpx camera.But the screen and camera alone was a bummer. With this phone there is no wow factor like when I got when I bough the S6 edge."

All of them came with supiciuos preinstalled glass protection. One of them for each family member (wife, me and sons). I came to the Z3+ in order to have all of my chargers standarized. My Z3 were a complete frustration about the magnetic conector (2 of them failed), but I still liked Sony for having a nice Android implementation. Also wanted to be conected with all my family during my stay in USA, so i decided for dual sim version. Two phones of the four I have bought have the touchscreen broken. I have realized of that as one of them stopped working properly after twoo weeks. In the past one dual sim Z3 supiciusly failed after trying to get photos of my daghter in the pool. Now, I have lose all confidence in dual sim versions selled on AMAZON with ""no warranty"". In the last twoo years 4 of the six phones I have bought failed (twoo Z3 and twoo Z3+). This has triggered the wish to move all family to iphones next year.Update: 3 of 4 Z3+ hace touchscreen broken!"

"396243","Sony Xperia Z3+ (Z3 Plus) E6533 5.2-Inch 32GB Factory Unlocked Smartphone Dual Sim - International Stock No warranty (Copper)",5,"I love the new Sony Z3+. I've been an iPhone user since 2007 when the first one came out. So, I was skeptical switching to Androids OS. Sony has done a great job of keeping things relatively simply UI wise. From comparing it with my friends Nexus which runs Stock Android, Sony hasn't strayed far away from Stock Android. Functionally, it does everything mostly the same as a stock system with a few added touches, that are well integrated. It does come with some bloatware but its non-invasive to the user experience, other than taking up some internal memory, which is easily compensated for with a good size micro SD card. I can do everything, multi-tasking is easy, it runs smoothly. The User Interface is very clean looking. Its aesthetically pleasing, well organized and doesn't look cluttered with a bunch of things. The clean looking interface is something i noticed was very different from Samsung's touchwiz, something I noticed when I had a chance to play around with a friends Galaxy S5 and was deciding on a new smartphone to purchase . Touchwiz on the S5 was quite cluttered and the theme wasn't as aesthetically pleasing to me. It was more of an eyesore despite the fact that I love OLED technology and Samsung is the only one using the display tech, the theme/skin just isn't nice too look at. Sony still has a much better grasp on design and aesthetics than its Korean revival. Another plus, great images underwater. The camera is absolutely fantastic. For most the camera could be hard to use because its Auto mode may not be the best, though not bad, it could be better. In Manual Mode this camera outshines the iPhone for sure. I can't speak on other phone cameras but i trust Sony to put the best sensor in their Phone. After all, they make almost all the sensors for iPhone and other smartphone companies. And Sony makes fantastics cameras, DSLRs and snap and shoots. They are also, creating image sensors for medical use and their cameras are the most used in the Professional Filming industry. All that technology is packed into this small little smartphone camera and it works wonderfully (other than the heating issue associated with Qualcomm's snapdragon 810 chipset)In regards to the over heating issue. It isn't as bad as some make it seem. it really only shows problems when using the AR modes and 4k on the camera app. Which is unfortunate because 4k is great and the AR modes are quite fun to use. Overall though, it heats up just like any other phone does when it comes to multitasking, long phone calls, or running heavy apps such as games with intensive graphics and waze. But it isn't bothersome. I remember all these things would cause my iPhone to get pretty hot. So, its not really an issue. I guess it does get a bit hotter than some other phones but I can't really blame Sony. At least they owned up to the fact that it does get hot and are trying to address the issue. Qualcomm the maker of the chipset won't even own up to the problem which is affecting Sony, HTC, LG and couple other flagship models. Shame on Qualcomm for ignoring their customers. If overheating is deterring you from buying this phone, be aware that the Samsung S6 is also suffering from heating issues. Just look up ""Samsung S6 heating up"" in google. The issue gets overlooked because Samsung is selling so many phones that google doesn't show the bad stuff first, Just like yelp doesn't show you the recent bad reviews of a restaurant unless refine the search to do so. HTC M9 is also heating up. This problem isn't only associated with Sony.Other than the heating issues when using the Camera Apps 4k mode and AR mode, everything else works great and I love it. Give Sony a shot if you are looking to try Android or want to buy a new Android that isn't the usual HTC, Samsung or LG."

Services are lte in area's while spoty even in well towered locations were smaller devices received lte. Which is a first for me and not sure if it could be a fluke. In ending this I can't help but realize I was only ok with this product and blame all 3 parties (me/Sony/t mobile) for a bland review.

Not sure if its the BT profile or the OS that is the issue, research has shown at this moment its the OS and how Google handles HFP.Update: 4-6-2016 down graded to 1 star, Woke up this morning to the phone beeping, would not turn on so I shut it down holding the power button. Restarted and thought all was good. As I started to work on the phone it got really hot and I received a message that the UI was not longer workingI restarted several times but no luck. I have returned the phone, Amazon is great on stuff like this. I have chosen to go with the Moto X Pure Edition as it has the Snapdragon 808 vs the 810 that seems to have issues. I truly loved the size and feel of the Sony and was hoping the issues were do to bad users, unfortunately the units are probably just bad.

The phone, despite being a last generation Xperia Device can take anything you throw at it. Any app, any game, it'll heat up to a point, but not enough to shut it down or damage the device. Heat is only natural for these devices as there are no other ways to disperse the heat besides the built in heat sinks.

"396300","Sony Xperia Z3+ (Z3 Plus) E6553 5.2-Inch 32GB Factory Unlocked Smartphone (Black) - International Stock no warranty",1,"I'm a Sony phone user for years but the company lost me with this one as I will never buy Sony phone ever again. This phone is terrible! I got a scratch on my screen the second day after a week my entire screen was scratched up. I dropped the phone once and it got bends and scratches all around the frame, that never happened with my old Sony phones I would drop them multiple times and never had even a scratch. Not only that whatever the phone is made out of sucks but also phone itself does not work well as it's overheating constantly especially when you use camera. Never again Sony! Have to move on to Samsung."
"396301","Sony Xperia Z3+ (Z3 Plus) E6553 5.2-Inch 32GB Factory Unlocked Smartphone (Black) - International Stock no warranty",1,"It gets very hot and the vibration of the speakers are in the back."
"396302","Sony Xperia Z3+ (Z3 Plus) E6553 5.2-Inch 32GB Factory Unlocked Smartphone (Black) - International Stock no warranty",2,"Pros:- Great out-of-box experience with the Android operating system. It's not heavily bogged with unwanted software. There is some software that comes from Sony that is uninstallable but most of it could be disabled. My previous phone was a LG Nexus 4 and compared to what came installed on that, I think it's pretty good.- Beautifully designed phone. The phone is slim, flat with rounded corners and glass backing. Nothing fancy but that's what makes it nice.- It's a powerful phone in terms of speed. It has a Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 processor that makes everything run smoothly. This is also a problem related to heat, more on that later.- Although the phone is advertised as waterproof, that's not true. It's more water-resistant actually. It's good for splashes and being caught in the rain but don't risk diving into a pool or ocean with it. An article from Xperia Blog explains why, I'd link it but Amazon won't let me for some reason.- ""my Xperia"" security feature. This feature makes it so a thief can't simply factory restore your stolen smartphone and use it. Only the Google account that factory reset it may unlock it. This is also a problem because of how it works, details under Cons.Cons:- Storage space usage of the Android OS. It has 32 GB of space for internal storage but about 9 GB is allotted for the Android OS (as of Android Marshmallow.- The heat this phone produces because of the Snapdragon 810. If you use this phone to do intensive or moderately intensive things (gaming, recording video, taking pictures, streaming...) the phone will warn you that it's becoming too hot and eventually shut itself off. This is problematic for times when you need your phone to work like capturing important moments of your life through the camera. I've had my Z3+ shut itself off when I was using it to record notes during a college class, that sucked.- The phone advertises that it has great battery life (2 days) and one of its selling points is STAMINA Mode. STAMINA Mode conserves battery life by allowing only specific apps to function while it's off and does other things too. The Z3+ had STAMINA mode when it was running Android Lollipop but when it upgraded to Android Marshmallow, that feature was removed. I loved the battery life when it was running Lollipop but not Marshmallow.- ""my Xperia"" security feature can lock you out of your Google account and phone if you use two factor authentication. The security feature requires you to log into your Google account using a password, not the code for two factor authentication. My authenticator codes are generated on the phone through the Google Authenticator app. When I activated the security feature, it locked the phone down and I no longer had access to the authenticator app, so I was locked out of my phone and my Google account. I was saved by backup codes I had printed out to go into my Google account deactivate two factor authentication.Bottom line: This is a nice phone but the issue with the heat, I can't recommend it for anyone that relies on their smartphone to do things other than calling, texting and browsing the internet, which is probably lots of people.Update: June 5, 2016STAMINA Mode has returned in an update I received the next day after I posted the review. Looking at how it's implemented in Marshmallow versus Lollipop, it provides the functions of conserving battery life but it removes any options for specifying which apps that it affects. That means all apps have limited functionality and that's bad if you want a specific app to have high priority. This is an issue when you want apps like email, messaging apps or app syncing to give you updates/notifications/functions ASAP. I can enable STAMINA Mode on at all times but it leaves a permanent notification that it's enabled, which is annoying. I didn't have this annoying notification in Lollipop."

Amazing look and feel to it. But.....andt this is a major deal breaking but!This phone runs extremely hot. I mean hot enough to cook your dinner on. It's really a shame as I was trying to convince myself to keep it despite this major flaw. But the reality is if the form doesn't follow function then it is useless as far as I am concerned.I really hope Sony tries to make another iteration of this phone without the Snapdragon 810 processor. The phone is too thin to dissipate the heat generated by this monster processor, and the design of the phone prohibits the effective use of this chip. Apparently a software patch will be out soon, but this will only serve to slow down the processor. At the end of the day, this is a hardware issue.I don't know what else quite frankly I'll be purchasing as I don't think anything comes close to it in terms of aesthetic appeal.On another note, the phone was shipped in an unsealed box. I am not used to purchasing new phones in an open box, and it would be nice if the vendor stated this before shipping it."

Unrooted version. The phone is clean.Pros:fast processor, decent screen, decent soundConsBattery life sucks. Overheats to ridiculous levels. Not fully compatible with Sony Bluetooth headphones.I will focus on what is wrong since those features are what matter to me the most.Battery life is BAD. Using the standard Sony Launcher, with 1-2 hours of calls each day, 50-100 texts, one or two youtube videos of 5 mins each, the battery barely lasts 7-8 hours. I don't play games other than occasional crossword. General activities are check email, update todo, and do calendars. My workday goes from 6 AM to 10 PM. So at 3/4 of my day, the phone is dead. It takes 4 hours for a full recharge. I have to charge in 10 minute bursts to keep up for the rest of the day.Heating is a HUGE problem. If the calls go longer than 10-15 minutes, the phone can barely be handled. Yes, it has the latest firmware in it. I cannot place the phone against my ear or even hold it by the corners because of the heating. That brings us to the next problem. I tried using headsets.The bluetooth pairing with Bose earpiece is bad on a good day. It drops the bluetooth connections randomly. The earpiece is in perfect shape since it works correctly with every other phone in the house (iphone, galaxy, moto X and moto G). So I purchased a Sony set. Same problems.Then I find out that it does not support wireless charging which Z3 supports. Obviously I did not do enough homework."

I've always admire Sony's phones, but was disappointed they never made it to Big Red (Verizon) or Ma Bell aka Big Blue (AT&T). When my PRIV's screen cracked I decided to order a budget android. Long story short I couldn't do it and decide to see what a fairly recent Xperia would cost. MONEY WELL SPENT! I love this phone, and the fact it's unlocked is even better! No more waiting on AT&T to put their touches on an update before pushing it. This phone is beautiful...the prettiest phone I've ever owned (and I've owned alot (but never iPhones)). It's performance, so far has been on point, screen is very nice, camera is great, no heating on the back experienced after heavy usage and doing all the updates. I was able to delete/disable most of the pre-installed apps. Everyone knows Sony puts out quality and cutting edge products that are harmonious with it's Japanese roots.

I've had them all. Blackberry, Windows, IPhone and Note 3, 4 and 5. I actually really like WP, but the app gap is an issue for me. The IPhone is the most overrated phone I have ever used. In my opinion, there is no beating an android. I have been extremely happy with the Note series. Now my Note literally looks like a hunk of junk compared to this. This is the nicest looking phone I've ever seen and I am extremely happy I chose the aqua green which looks more like an aqua silver(?). I expected it to be nice, but not this nice. It's like I went from a beat up Buick(with a suped up engine) to a Mercedes. This thing is premium luxury. At least in my opinion.Pros - Extremely attractive phone. Premium. Luxury. Thin and light. Great specs. Great screen. Great camera, better than most. Everything you want out of a high end device. There are also some customization's I can do with this phone that I couldn't do with the Note which is surprising.Con's - It heats up quick. The top back gets hot, but it hasn't bothered me or the phone. And I've been using it all day. I have yet to experience the over exaggerated issue with this. Hopefully I don't. The specs are a hair below other premium devices like the Note and you can tell. It is a hair slower. The biggest issue I have is with the battery. I have not been able to plug it because I've never seen a plug like this before. I'm going to have to get some kind of adapter. I've been charging it with the USB and it's been slowwwwww. It won't charge if you're using it. It wastes more than it gets. The battery drains faster than usual. Hopefully there is a fix for all of this.Overall - Despite the con's, I couldn't be happier. Best phone I've ever owned and I can say that while using it for less than a day."

I got it replaced and it works fine now. I think to fix just the screen is more expensive than other flagship phones like Samsung. It cost me $230 in the states to fix. In order to fix they have to remove everything from the phone to get toit.- The battery is hard to remove. You have to heat the back and pry it open to get to the battery.- I haven't dunked my phone completely in the water or anything. But I'm not exactly careful when it comes to water and it works fine. Examples include me using phone when bathing with wet hands, rain, spills and putting phone under a running faucet to clean it lol.- There is complaints of the phone getting very hot and overheating. Honestly its not that bad, any phone can get hot after prolonged use and I have never had it overheat to the point where it shuts down . I think that when I first got the phone it would get hotter quickly opposed to how it is now.

The only thing is that the Android version of Sony is a bit ugly and has unnecessary and annoying features, like the floating apps in the multitasking screen amth the options banner at the left of the app box. It's awesome to have a waterproof phone."

The phone experience overall has been amazing, camera very solid, performance good, battery will get me through an entire day without using stamina mode, and my Good app is constantly syncing so that is impressive.

Would absolutely buy again."
"396376","Sony Xperia Z3+ (Z3 Plus) E6553 5.2-Inch 32GB Factory Unlocked Smartphone (Black) - International Stock no warranty",4,"Bought the phone 2 weeks ago. The phone came in a small box, and it is a Hong Kong version, with everything in Chinese since this is a international version of the phone. I use T-Mobile in USA, and it worked just find with the LTE. The phone did came with a VERY SMALL scratch on the side. I contact the seller, and they are willing to take the phone back for a look and replace a new one, but I had to leave town couple of days later so I did not return it since it was a very small scratch, and they were willing to accept the return. The seller however was not from Sony, it is by OE USA. The phone is also very thin and I am still not fully used to it, also I took the phone to the pool, and was able to use it for a good while, but it started to heat up and after a long while, it turn off by itself. After that I was able to turn my phone back on with no problem at all. So far I like it, will give more update later.Update Oct 21 2015- The phone seem to work fine still, one problem I do seem to be having is that when I put a phone call on speaker, the other caller seem to not be able to hear me when I talk. Not sure what is the cause of the problem."
"396377","Sony Xperia Z3+ (Z3 Plus) E6553 5.2-Inch 32GB Factory Unlocked Smartphone (Black) - International Stock no warranty",1,"Pros: * it looks really nice. I have received many complements for this phone from people (at least to me) * it feels very nice and it is pretty sturdy! I have dropped it many times but it still works and the screen is not shattered.Cons: * Don't buy this phone. The overheating issue is not something you can look over. It makes the phone literally unusable. Overheating causes this phone to slow down significantly to the point you want to scream. Any app that uses the CPU intensively slows down the phone. I will list the top apps that you practically can't use:1- Camera: YOU CANNOT USE THE CAMERA more than a minute or so. It becomes very unfortunate when you are recording a rare event (let's say a concert and your camera app shuts down because the phone is overheated. You cannot trust the camera for being quick and responsive either when your phone is hot. It takes a while to load and start working. 2- Maps (navigation): navigation is a CPU heavy process. That means it no camera or any other feature of your phone while that's happening. To be fair, you can make calls but the phone works so slow that it really goes on your nerves! 3- Snapchat: Snapchat is impossible to use on this phone. even if the phone is perfectly idle, Snapchat kills your phone. It makes your phone extremely hot in in tens of seconds and becomes unresponsive until. It's not to say you can't use it at all, it's just you have wait and be patient when you are using it. so if something is happening and you want to send a quick snap of that moment, you should forget about that! Even worse, if you connect your phone to a charger and open Snapchat your phone gets hot in no time and although the charger is still connected you battery percentage keeps slowly going down. 4- Skype: it's like Snapchat but a little better. You can't really use skype and multi-task. Skype alone is very heavy on the phone."

It was the perfect balance of specs without being a phablet like every phone is now. If I had written this review earlier, it would've gotten 5 stars, but, that was before....the phone slid off a chair seat 2' from the floor and completely bricked. Normally, I'd do some quick repairs, but Sony phones are a bit unforgiving in this department (have to heat the glue, etc).Moved to the OnePlus 3 and I'm not looking back. I admit, I was a Sony fanboy, but the water-resistance isn't enough to warrant the price or the apparent frailty of the device."

Sony has removed the magnetic charging for it, moved the USB charging port to the bottom of the phone, and switched sides on the slot that contains the SD card and the nano sim.So, not only was my cool magnetic charging dock not going to work at all, the cool new aluminum case would have to have the screw removed and removed every time I wanted to charge it... Obviously, a no go either.The functionality of the phone itself is near flawless, I especially enjoy the Remote Play feature that allows you to use it as a second monitor or rather the main screen for playing the ps4 on. Connecting of the controller to the phone is a pretty seamless process, and all you have to do to connect it back to the ps4 is plug it back into the ps4.Overall, the phone works great, I was just a little bummed about the whole magnetic charging things. I don't know how this escaped to my attention, eith all the research I put into it.I will update as we go with this"

Please not that after you sign in and get set up it will require updated that will take at least 30-45min as the phone updated to Marshmallow from Lollipop.> Excellent build> Great Battery life> Performance is amazing> Screen is beautiful and clean, the built in email app is fantastic,> if you have an Outlook, Hotmail or Live email and use MS for everything, this app is better than the Outlook app and it syncs to the phone Calendar and contacts> I have a 128G card in the phone and its easy to move apps to the card> overall could not be happierOnly issue I have is HFP for the Google maps and Texting through my cars Audio system. Not sure if its the BT profile or the OS that is the issue, research has shown at this moment its the OS and how Google handles HFP.Update: 4-6-2016 down graded to 1 star, Woke up this morning to the phone beeping, would not turn on so I shut it down holding the power button. Restarted and thought all was good. As I started to work on the phone it got really hot and I received a message that the UI was not longer workingI restarted several times but no luck. I have returned the phone, Amazon is great on stuff like this. I have chosen to go with the Moto X Pure Edition as it has the Snapdragon 808 vs the 810 that seems to have issues. I truly loved the size and feel of the Sony and was hoping the issues were do to bad users, unfortunately the units are probably just bad.

The phone, despite being a last generation Xperia Device can take anything you throw at it. Any app, any game, it'll heat up to a point, but not enough to shut it down or damage the device. Heat is only natural for these devices as there are no other ways to disperse the heat besides the built in heat sinks.

I dropped the phone once and it got bends and scratches all around the frame, that never happened with my old Sony phones I would drop them multiple times and never had even a scratch. Not only that whatever the phone is made out of sucks but also phone itself does not work well as it's overheating constantly especially when you use camera. Never again Sony!

"396435","Sony Xperia Z3+ (Z3 Plus) E6553 5.2-Inch 32GB Factory Unlocked Smartphone (Black) - International Stock no warranty",2,"Pros:- Great out-of-box experience with the Android operating system. It's not heavily bogged with unwanted software. There is some software that comes from Sony that is uninstallable but most of it could be disabled. My previous phone was a LG Nexus 4 and compared to what came installed on that, I think it's pretty good.- Beautifully designed phone. The phone is slim, flat with rounded corners and glass backing. Nothing fancy but that's what makes it nice.- It's a powerful phone in terms of speed. It has a Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 processor that makes everything run smoothly. This is also a problem related to heat, more on that later.- Although the phone is advertised as waterproof, that's not true. It's more water-resistant actually. It's good for splashes and being caught in the rain but don't risk diving into a pool or ocean with it. An article from Xperia Blog explains why, I'd link it but Amazon won't let me for some reason.- ""my Xperia"" security feature. This feature makes it so a thief can't simply factory restore your stolen smartphone and use it. Only the Google account that factory reset it may unlock it. This is also a problem because of how it works, details under Cons.Cons:- Storage space usage of the Android OS. It has 32 GB of space for internal storage but about 9 GB is allotted for the Android OS (as of Android Marshmallow.- The heat this phone produces because of the Snapdragon 810. If you use this phone to do intensive or moderately intensive things (gaming, recording video, taking pictures, streaming...) the phone will warn you that it's becoming too hot and eventually shut itself off. This is problematic for times when you need your phone to work like capturing important moments of your life through the camera. I've had my Z3+ shut itself off when I was using it to record notes during a college class, that sucked.- The phone advertises that it has great battery life (2 days) and one of its selling points is STAMINA Mode. STAMINA Mode conserves battery life by allowing only specific apps to function while it's off and does other things too. The Z3+ had STAMINA mode when it was running Android Lollipop but when it upgraded to Android Marshmallow, that feature was removed. I loved the battery life when it was running Lollipop but not Marshmallow.- ""my Xperia"" security feature can lock you out of your Google account and phone if you use two factor authentication. The security feature requires you to log into your Google account using a password, not the code for two factor authentication. My authenticator codes are generated on the phone through the Google Authenticator app. When I activated the security feature, it locked the phone down and I no longer had access to the authenticator app, so I was locked out of my phone and my Google account. I was saved by backup codes I had printed out to go into my Google account deactivate two factor authentication.Bottom line: This is a nice phone but the issue with the heat, I can't recommend it for anyone that relies on their smartphone to do things other than calling, texting and browsing the internet, which is probably lots of people.Update: June 5, 2016STAMINA Mode has returned in an update I received the next day after I posted the review. Looking at how it's implemented in Marshmallow versus Lollipop, it provides the functions of conserving battery life but it removes any options for specifying which apps that it affects. That means all apps have limited functionality and that's bad if you want a specific app to have high priority. This is an issue when you want apps like email, messaging apps or app syncing to give you updates/notifications/functions ASAP. I can enable STAMINA Mode on at all times but it leaves a permanent notification that it's enabled, which is annoying. I didn't have this annoying notification in Lollipop."

I've always admire Sony's phones, but was disappointed they never made it to Big Red (Verizon) or Ma Bell aka Big Blue (AT&T). When my PRIV's screen cracked I decided to order a budget android. Long story short I couldn't do it and decide to see what a fairly recent Xperia would cost. MONEY WELL SPENT! I love this phone, and the fact it's unlocked is even better! No more waiting on AT&T to put their touches on an update before pushing it. This phone is beautiful...the prettiest phone I've ever owned (and I've owned alot (but never iPhones)). It's performance, so far has been on point, screen is very nice, camera is great, no heating on the back experienced after heavy usage and doing all the updates. I was able to delete/disable most of the pre-installed apps. Everyone knows Sony puts out quality and cutting edge products that are harmonious with it's Japanese roots.

I've had them all. Blackberry, Windows, IPhone and Note 3, 4 and 5. I actually really like WP, but the app gap is an issue for me. The IPhone is the most overrated phone I have ever used. In my opinion, there is no beating an android. I have been extremely happy with the Note series. Now my Note literally looks like a hunk of junk compared to this. This is the nicest looking phone I've ever seen and I am extremely happy I chose the aqua green which looks more like an aqua silver(?). I expected it to be nice, but not this nice. It's like I went from a beat up Buick(with a suped up engine) to a Mercedes. This thing is premium luxury. At least in my opinion.Pros - Extremely attractive phone. Premium. Luxury. Thin and light. Great specs. Great screen. Great camera, better than most. Everything you want out of a high end device. There are also some customization's I can do with this phone that I couldn't do with the Note which is surprising.Con's - It heats up quick. The top back gets hot, but it hasn't bothered me or the phone. And I've been using it all day. I have yet to experience the over exaggerated issue with this. Hopefully I don't. The specs are a hair below other premium devices like the Note and you can tell. It is a hair slower. The biggest issue I have is with the battery. I have not been able to plug it because I've never seen a plug like this before. I'm going to have to get some kind of adapter. I've been charging it with the USB and it's been slowwwwww. It won't charge if you're using it. It wastes more than it gets. The battery drains faster than usual. Hopefully there is a fix for all of this.Overall - Despite the con's, I couldn't be happier. Best phone I've ever owned and I can say that while using it for less than a day."

If you're part of the lucky group which doesn't face overheating issues...well it is a really good phone but if you aren't, I have to say, you just got an expensive toaster. Overheats a LOT, battery last nothing, lagging sometimes due to the processor overheats, recording a video? You can do it just for a couple of minutes or even less. More than once I had to take it out of my pocket because It was burning my leg (I'm not exaggerating), Maps + Spotify? It's a nice way to kill your brand new phone. Maybe saying this everybody could get a better picture of the issue: overheats even running WhatsApp and Chrome. It's not my first Xperia Z phone series and well.... this one is very disappointing."

"396734","Sony Xperia Z3+ (Z3 Plus) E6553 5.2-Inch 32GB Factory Unlocked Smartphone (White) - International Stock - No Warranty",5,"Great phone. I love it. Despite the negatives below.Some things:- I cracked the screen and apparently even the smallest crack on screen makes the touch unresponsive rendering the phone useless. I got it replaced and it works fine now. I think to fix just the screen is more expensive than other flagship phones like Samsung. It cost me $230 in the states to fix. In order to fix they have to remove everything from the phone to get toit.- The battery is hard to remove. You have to heat the back and pry it open to get to the battery.- I haven't dunked my phone completely in the water or anything. But I'm not exactly careful when it comes to water and it works fine. Examples include me using phone when bathing with wet hands, rain, spills and putting phone under a running faucet to clean it lol.- There is complaints of the phone getting very hot and overheating. Honestly its not that bad, any phone can get hot after prolonged use and I have never had it overheat to the point where it shuts down . I think that when I first got the phone it would get hotter quickly opposed to how it is now. My theory is that it was a new unused phone and was not used to being used as much as it is now.- if I think of anything else I'll come back"

The only thing is that the Android version of Sony is a bit ugly and has unnecessary and annoying features, like the floating apps in the multitasking screen amth the options banner at the left of the app box. It's awesome to have a waterproof phone."
"396740","Sony Xperia Z3+ (Z3 Plus) E6553 5.2-Inch 32GB Factory Unlocked Smartphone (White) - International Stock - No Warranty",1,"Pros: * it looks really nice. I have received many complements for this phone from people (at least to me) * it feels very nice and it is pretty sturdy! I have dropped it many times but it still works and the screen is not shattered.Cons: * Don't buy this phone. The overheating issue is not something you can look over. It makes the phone literally unusable. Overheating causes this phone to slow down significantly to the point you want to scream. Any app that uses the CPU intensively slows down the phone. I will list the top apps that you practically can't use:1- Camera: YOU CANNOT USE THE CAMERA more than a minute or so. It becomes very unfortunate when you are recording a rare event (let's say a concert and your camera app shuts down because the phone is overheated. You cannot trust the camera for being quick and responsive either when your phone is hot. It takes a while to load and start working. 2- Maps (navigation): navigation is a CPU heavy process. That means it no camera or any other feature of your phone while that's happening. To be fair, you can make calls but the phone works so slow that it really goes on your nerves! 3- Snapchat: Snapchat is impossible to use on this phone. even if the phone is perfectly idle, Snapchat kills your phone. It makes your phone extremely hot in in tens of seconds and becomes unresponsive until. It's not to say you can't use it at all, it's just you have wait and be patient when you are using it. so if something is happening and you want to send a quick snap of that moment, you should forget about that! Even worse, if you connect your phone to a charger and open Snapchat your phone gets hot in no time and although the charger is still connected you battery percentage keeps slowly going down. 4- Skype: it's like Snapchat but a little better. You can't really use skype and multi-task. Skype alone is very heavy on the phone."

If I had written this review earlier, it would've gotten 5 stars, but, that was before....the phone slid off a chair seat 2' from the floor and completely bricked. Normally, I'd do some quick repairs, but Sony phones are a bit unforgiving in this department (have to heat the glue, etc).Moved to the OnePlus 3 and I'm not looking back.

"396777","Sony Xperia Z3+ (Z3 Plus) E6553 5.2-Inch 32GB Factory Unlocked Smartphone (White) - International Stock - No Warranty",4,"So I bought this sweet looking new phone with a few accessories, a Devilcase aluminum case, and a magnetic charging dock.Surprise! Sony has removed the magnetic charging for it, moved the USB charging port to the bottom of the phone, and switched sides on the slot that contains the SD card and the nano sim.So, not only was my cool magnetic charging dock not going to work at all, the cool new aluminum case would have to have the screw removed and removed every time I wanted to charge it... Obviously, a no go either.The functionality of the phone itself is near flawless, I especially enjoy the Remote Play feature that allows you to use it as a second monitor or rather the main screen for playing the ps4 on. Connecting of the controller to the phone is a pretty seamless process, and all you have to do to connect it back to the ps4 is plug it back into the ps4.Overall, the phone works great, I was just a little bummed about the whole magnetic charging things. I don't know how this escaped to my attention, eith all the research I put into it.I will update as we go with this"

The phone came in a small box, and it is a Hong Kong version, with everything in Chinese since this is a international version of the phone. I use T-Mobile in USA, and it worked just find with the LTE. The phone did came with a VERY SMALL scratch on the side. I contact the seller, and they are willing to take the phone back for a look and replace a new one, but I had to leave town couple of days later so I did not return it since it was a very small scratch, and they were willing to accept the return. The seller however was not from Sony, it is by OE USA. The phone is also very thin and I am still not fully used to it, also I took the phone to the pool, and was able to use it for a good while, but it started to heat up and after a long while, it turn off by itself. After that I was able to turn my phone back on with no problem at all. So far I like it, will give more update later.Update Oct 21 2015- The phone seem to work fine still, one problem I do seem to be having is that when I put a phone call on speaker, the other caller seem to not be able to hear me when I talk. Not sure what is the cause of the problem."

Please not that after you sign in and get set up it will require updated that will take at least 30-45min as the phone updated to Marshmallow from Lollipop.> Excellent build> Great Battery life> Performance is amazing> Screen is beautiful and clean, the built in email app is fantastic,> if you have an Outlook, Hotmail or Live email and use MS for everything, this app is better than the Outlook app and it syncs to the phone Calendar and contacts> I have a 128G card in the phone and its easy to move apps to the card> overall could not be happierOnly issue I have is HFP for the Google maps and Texting through my cars Audio system. Not sure if its the BT profile or the OS that is the issue, research has shown at this moment its the OS and how Google handles HFP.Update: 4-6-2016 down graded to 1 star, Woke up this morning to the phone beeping, would not turn on so I shut it down holding the power button. Restarted and thought all was good. As I started to work on the phone it got really hot and I received a message that the UI was not longer workingI restarted several times but no luck. I have returned the phone, Amazon is great on stuff like this. I have chosen to go with the Moto X Pure Edition as it has the Snapdragon 808 vs the 810 that seems to have issues. I truly loved the size and feel of the Sony and was hoping the issues were do to bad users, unfortunately the units are probably just bad.

The phone, despite being a last generation Xperia Device can take anything you throw at it. Any app, any game, it'll heat up to a point, but not enough to shut it down or damage the device.

Amazing look and feel to it. But.....andt this is a major deal breaking but!This phone runs extremely hot. I mean hot enough to cook your dinner on. It's really a shame as I was trying to convince myself to keep it despite this major flaw. But the reality is if the form doesn't follow function then it is useless as far as I am concerned.I really hope Sony tries to make another iteration of this phone without the Snapdragon 810 processor. The phone is too thin to dissipate the heat generated by this monster processor, and the design of the phone prohibits the effective use of this chip. Apparently a software patch will be out soon, but this will only serve to slow down the processor. At the end of the day, this is a hardware issue.I don't know what else quite frankly I'll be purchasing as I don't think anything comes close to it in terms of aesthetic appeal.On another note, the phone was shipped in an unsealed box.

Unrooted version. The phone is clean.Pros:fast processor, decent screen, decent soundConsBattery life sucks. Overheats to ridiculous levels. Not fully compatible with Sony Bluetooth headphones.I will focus on what is wrong since those features are what matter to me the most.Battery life is BAD. Using the standard Sony Launcher, with 1-2 hours of calls each day, 50-100 texts, one or two youtube videos of 5 mins each, the battery barely lasts 7-8 hours. I don't play games other than occasional crossword. General activities are check email, update todo, and do calendars. My workday goes from 6 AM to 10 PM. So at 3/4 of my day, the phone is dead. It takes 4 hours for a full recharge. I have to charge in 10 minute bursts to keep up for the rest of the day.Heating is a HUGE problem. If the calls go longer than 10-15 minutes, the phone can barely be handled. Yes, it has the latest firmware in it. I cannot place the phone against my ear or even hold it by the corners because of the heating. That brings us to the next problem. I tried using headsets.The bluetooth pairing with Bose earpiece is bad on a good day. It drops the bluetooth connections randomly. The earpiece is in perfect shape since it works correctly with every other phone in the house (iphone, galaxy, moto X and moto G). So I purchased a Sony set. Same problems.Then I find out that it does not support wireless charging which Z3 supports. Obviously I did not do enough homework."

"396831","Sony Xperia Z3+ (Z3 Plus) E6553 5.2-Inch 32GB Factory Unlocked Smartphone (White) - International Stock - No Warranty",2,"Pros:- Great out-of-box experience with the Android operating system. It's not heavily bogged with unwanted software. There is some software that comes from Sony that is uninstallable but most of it could be disabled. My previous phone was a LG Nexus 4 and compared to what came installed on that, I think it's pretty good.- Beautifully designed phone. The phone is slim, flat with rounded corners and glass backing. Nothing fancy but that's what makes it nice.- It's a powerful phone in terms of speed. It has a Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 processor that makes everything run smoothly. This is also a problem related to heat, more on that later.- Although the phone is advertised as waterproof, that's not true. It's more water-resistant actually. It's good for splashes and being caught in the rain but don't risk diving into a pool or ocean with it. An article from Xperia Blog explains why, I'd link it but Amazon won't let me for some reason.- ""my Xperia"" security feature. This feature makes it so a thief can't simply factory restore your stolen smartphone and use it. Only the Google account that factory reset it may unlock it. This is also a problem because of how it works, details under Cons.Cons:- Storage space usage of the Android OS. It has 32 GB of space for internal storage but about 9 GB is allotted for the Android OS (as of Android Marshmallow.- The heat this phone produces because of the Snapdragon 810. If you use this phone to do intensive or moderately intensive things (gaming, recording video, taking pictures, streaming...) the phone will warn you that it's becoming too hot and eventually shut itself off. This is problematic for times when you need your phone to work like capturing important moments of your life through the camera. I've had my Z3+ shut itself off when I was using it to record notes during a college class, that sucked.- The phone advertises that it has great battery life (2 days) and one of its selling points is STAMINA Mode. STAMINA Mode conserves battery life by allowing only specific apps to function while it's off and does other things too. The Z3+ had STAMINA mode when it was running Android Lollipop but when it upgraded to Android Marshmallow, that feature was removed. I loved the battery life when it was running Lollipop but not Marshmallow.- ""my Xperia"" security feature can lock you out of your Google account and phone if you use two factor authentication. The security feature requires you to log into your Google account using a password, not the code for two factor authentication. My authenticator codes are generated on the phone through the Google Authenticator app. When I activated the security feature, it locked the phone down and I no longer had access to the authenticator app, so I was locked out of my phone and my Google account. I was saved by backup codes I had printed out to go into my Google account deactivate two factor authentication.Bottom line: This is a nice phone but the issue with the heat, I can't recommend it for anyone that relies on their smartphone to do things other than calling, texting and browsing the internet, which is probably lots of people.Update: June 5, 2016STAMINA Mode has returned in an update I received the next day after I posted the review. Looking at how it's implemented in Marshmallow versus Lollipop, it provides the functions of conserving battery life but it removes any options for specifying which apps that it affects. That means all apps have limited functionality and that's bad if you want a specific app to have high priority. This is an issue when you want apps like email, messaging apps or app syncing to give you updates/notifications/functions ASAP. I can enable STAMINA Mode on at all times but it leaves a permanent notification that it's enabled, which is annoying. I didn't have this annoying notification in Lollipop."

The one and only problem I find in this phone is the overheating,It's not uncomfortable to hold but dims the screen and supposedly shuts down camera app(has yet to happen to me).Speaking of the screen,It's super bright and has great contrast.Triluminous technology is awesome.The front firing speakers are not loud at all but I know exactly why,it's the waterproof membrane muffling high output.However,output through headphones and or aux. cord is amazing,Hi Res audio,EQ settings galore,sound effects......this it what I grew up on,Walkmans,CD Walkman from Sony.The phone is at a perfect width for one handed use.5.2 inch screen is just right.Screen to body ratio is decent.This phone is fast too,I've thrown a lot of multi tasking at it and it keeps up with it all,no lags in gaming or browsing.Call quality is just fantastic.There are call EQ settings,I have it set to Bright.The ear speaker during calls is so loud and clear It reminds me of Motorola phones or better.There is also a slow speech setting which slows down the incoming speech during call in real time(other Sonys have this feature too).I am totally recommending this phone.Camera is great but not up there with the flagship Samsung Galaxy line.Does the job though.I love my phone and it amazes me everyday.I get LTE with Tmobile and I am 99% sure it has the ATT LTE bands too."

I can't make this phone record more than 1 minute in any resolution!Besides that, i'm very dissapointed with Sony, the box doesn't bring headphones and nothing more than the user manual and charger.

I have a case and screen protector on it. I squatted to pick up something i dropped, it fell out of my pocket. Fell about 2 feet onto the driveway. And shattered. Pic included. This is NOT a regular sony xperia. This is nothing more than a cheap replica. It overheats, all the time (No video longer than 5 mins or it shuts off from heat), it has s***ty 4g service (all other phones in the house, same carrier, have full service), and broke after falling 2 feet.I love the Sony Xperia series of phones. The price point is similar to older galaxies, with better specs. I use my phone for just about everything. Decent graphics. Good processing speed. Water proof up to 30 ft for 30 mins. The new z3+ has removed the port cover over the charging hole so the worn gasket is no longer an issue. Light weight. Perfect size for me excellent rf camera.The other xperias I had I got thru tmobile. Tmobile no longer carries them so I got a new one off Amazon (the old one took 10 too many falls and the auto rotate stopped working). We got an lg v10 since it was the only android even close to having a comprable camera without samsungs inflated pricingWhen it came time to buy me a separate phone I came to Amazon for a bew Xperia.This one has issues ive never had before: low network signal strength (usually one bar or less). Random shut offs. (I have to force a power cycle)Actually gets over heated.Not happy w the unlocked Sony.But mostly I dont talk jist text and Internet via WiFi so I still prefer this phone...but."

Mine has Firmware 28.0.A.8.266 (I did the update) and it still continued with the problem. It's a really good looking phone, but this problem it's a major turndown. It's better if you go for an IPhone 6, Samsung S6, or LG G4! They don't present this problem. Unfortunately, I sent this phone to one friend in the US to bring it to me to Guatemala; and now It's difficult to me to return it, despite it has warranty. I buy it from Amazon. What a waste of $400. Sony disappointed me!"

I've had the Z3+ for two weeks now and I am more than pleased with the phone's performance. I usually end the day with 40% battery, even with a fair amount of time with the screen on.

"396869","Sony Xperia Z3+ E6553 32GB Unlocked GSM Android Smartphone w/ 23 Megapixel Camera - White (International version, No Warranty)",1,"Should be zero star. Sony is recycling defected returns so you are putting your hard earned money at risk. Unless you don't expect to drop it, or similar ordeals. Here's my experience with xperia. I have gone three three defected xperia over just eight months. I got the first one from t-mobile and the camera button kept pressed after 12th days. I was able toget t-mobile to get me the second one. After using the second one for about seven months, the USB lid somehow getting enlarged a little, so it could not be closed tightly anymore unless i pressed it in harder. Because of this, it got water in one time when i forgot to do the harder press before giving it a little hand wash. The water made it not connectible, unable to get wifi nor making calls. I then bought the third one xperia 3+, and it only last three weeks failed to handle a 3 feet drop. Before this drop, i kind of getting the feeling this phone was a defected that got whatever it's previous problem fixed and thengot turned back to the market. Therefore, i purchased a tough case for it. But, it couldn't handle the 3 feet drop and it's screen stopped showing anything. I tried for few days and it's display just no longer working. It's only the display that stopped working on this of my third xperia. Now i learned the hard way that this Sony's xperia has really quality issues - both brand new as well as replenished. When i later went back to t-mobile, they have already stopped selling or discontinued the xperia phones. We chat a little about all kinds of problems with xperia and concluded it's a good phone if it doesn't getting broken, which proved to be a bit lacking. I switced to Samsung S6, and so far i got a small drop and it's still functioning well. Sony will keep recycling fixed phones back to the market. I got to say they didn't do well on durability testing before bringing xperia 3 onto the market. So, you better get insurance when you buy one. Read carefully the ones they are selling through retailers like Amazon and you will notice the are mostly unlocked (which is nice), but they are NOT warranted. From now on, i would rather look at reviews that are from long time owners."

Looks and feels great in the hand, a little slippery. I love the minimalist, simple, elegant design. Nothing is overdone - just the right hint of everything. I really, really loved this phone. So, why the two star review? Simple, such a great and amazing phone - crippled by overheating. Yes, overheating. If you don't use the camera for video's, it will not overheat. If you use the camera for video's greater than two minutes outside on a warm day - it will overheat and shut the camera down. Yup, it does'nt care if you are shooting a clip of your kid playing in the park, or your dog catching a frisbee - it's overheated and needs to shut down and it will!. It does this for full HD or 4K videos.This phone had so much potential. :-( Unfortunately, it overheats and you can not use it!Sony tried to release an update, which I did have applied, still to no avail.If you do not shoot video clips, this phone is amazing, you should get it. If you do shoot video clips >1-2:00 minutes; this may not work for you."
"396879","Sony Xperia Z3+ E6553 32GB Unlocked GSM Android Smartphone w/ 23 Megapixel Camera - White (International version, No Warranty)",1,"One star is the minimum I can get, but my experience with Sony Xperia phones and support deserves less than that; Z3+ gets an F!My main reason to buy it was because I needed a waterproof phone that I can take with me in my trainings and running races. It did perform well and resisted many splashes, but the killer agent came from within. I don't know if it's a hardware or software issue but these phones are prone to have a sudden death as I learned from my own experience. Upon contacting Sony support for help, they provided me with steps that would force a factory reset (hopefully one has done backups before). Well, this didn't work for me and I ended up sending the phone back for a repair. Sony promised, over a month ago by the time I'm writing this review, that a working phone would be send back to my within 15 business days. The latest answer I've been given is that it will take at least two more weeks.I'm working abroad now and I couldn't live without a phone, so THANK YOU Sony for indirectly introducing me to my new Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge! No need to return the phone - you wouldn't ship it to Singapore anyway."
"396880","Sony Xperia Z3+ E6553 32GB Unlocked GSM Android Smartphone w/ 23 Megapixel Camera - White (International version, No Warranty)",3,"This phone had such great potential. The small things worked so well: the GPS was accurate, speakers were great, build quality is on point. The issue I had is with the camera, I don't understand why you have to drop down in megapixels for certain modes. I was highly disappointed with the camera. How can the company that makes the almost perfect A6000 fail so bad on a cell phone camera? Another issue is that this phone gets hot. Like, really hot. When I was taking a normal video it would give me warnings that it was getting too hot and would shut down the app. That's completely inexcusable. I'd look elsewhere if I were you."

I exchanged the first white phone shipped to me, as it did not have a USB cover, which makes it waterproof. The second one had the USB cover, but it keeps falling open. The interior plastic or rubber part to the USB cover is defective. It will not secure. Further, it appears the other materials on the white phone are significantly inferior to those of the black phone materials. The white phone has both cheaper looking and feeling plastic or glass and metal exterior parts to the black version I received.I certainly would not risk dunking the white phone in water.

Screen is good, call quality is average to good, battery life seems decent so far.The major drawback I have with this phone, and this is nowhere that I found in any of the descriptions online, you have to dig for it, is YOU CANNOT USE MOBILE NETWORK DATA WHILE CALLING. These days this is an issue that is pretty unique to Verizon, and even so there are plenty of phones out there that get around this by having two antennas. This isn't one of them. In the past, I've found the simultaneous data-while-calling to be something I don't need to use all that often, but when I do, I REALLY do need it. And I'm simply incredulous that Sony would release a Verizon phone that doesn't support it. For me, it takes this phone from one I hoped to use for a couple of years, to one that I keep until the contract rolls over.Also irritating, the phone puts up a big warning message about not having data while calling (except on WiFi) when I make a call.

"396996","Sony Xperia Z5 32GB GSM/LTE - Unlocked phone - (US Warranty)- Retail Packaging (Black)",5,"Received the phone yesterday and it is as expected. I haven't gotten the device soaked yet but it is fast, runs cool, and the display looks great even in direct daylight. Didn't get outrageously warm and the battery life looks like it will outperform what reviews led me to expect. I didn't really care about or want the finger print scanner so I am not torn up about that. The phone itself is understated ""chic"" I suppose. Its solid in the hand, has a nice little loop notch which was an unexpected surprise that will probably go unused here.I am particularly impressed with the headphone output on this phone. resolution and quality of output are on par with an HTC One M8. The M8 has the edge in absolute power output but this phone is capable of making good use of a Tidal account on the go. Has enough power to drive the Shure Srh-1840 to uncomfortable levels. Doesn't seem to mind hte ultra-low impedance of the Shure SE846 although absolute refinement of sound seems to take a slight hit compared to the HTC one M8. Four hours of Tidal streaming @ CD quality seemed to eat about 10% of the phones battery driving the SRH-1840 and the screen mostly off which I consider to be another solid showing.Especially for the money, I feel its quite a nice device."

And i don't blame sony for this. for couple of years, Android cellphones industry is in static situation and nothing new or awesome is coming out. every renowned brand's flagship phones are circling around, camera, water proof, sound, finger prints, resolution etc. nothing special or extra ordinary coming out. i gave 4 stars because battery life is not improved, i was expecting better performance in battery life."

I finally got it through Amazon, and this phone is absolutely blazing fast! However the number the Sony Guy provided me to purchase an additional warranty didn't pan out, I still feel this phone deserves a full 5 star review. The camera, the graphics, the power, The playstation integration for gamers, this phone is exactly what I have been waiting for to upgrade for my trusty Xperia Play R800 and I couldn't be happier. Unless of course it slid out into a PlayStation controller like the old R800's but the display, camera, and about everything else make this phone so vastly superior in every aspect. I'm not even mad the U.S. version didn't get a finger print scanner as there is a ton of apps for that, and that wasn't a selling point anyways for me. I am in love all over again with another great Xperia!"

Buttery Smooth performance along with speed and the camera is just amazing, so many great things about this phone that I can go on about. I have read that people are upset about Sony not including the fingerprint scanner from the power button which to me is not a big deal since I have not yet to use it on my previous devices so I honestly could care less of the feature and I also doubt that I would ever use it if it was included. However this phone is great and I am enjoying it."
"397005","Sony Xperia Z5 32GB GSM/LTE - Unlocked phone - (US Warranty)- Retail Packaging (Black)",5,"I am impressed with the quality of this phone,The Xperia Z5 display excellent color reproduction and sharpness, has an excellent image, the glass screen feels sturdy, the software and hardware environment respond quickly and smooth, I have been using continuously and has no overheating by the continued use of streaming as z3,The Xperia Z5 is very well put together, with Gorilla Glass 4 on the front and back, an aluminum frame and rubber bumpers on the corners to help absorb shock if the phone is dropped,The camera has truly excellent auto-focus,regarding the battery of sony phone I do not see a big difference compared to other phones like Samsung or IPhone S6,but The biggest departure in design terms, is the look of the power button. Sony’s trademark protruding chrome-effect circle, which has been around for years, has now been replaced by an elongated lozenge, slightly inset from the edge to prevent you accidentally pressing it.I particularly recommend this phone to a friend."

I have a LTE signal on the device. One of the biggest pros for the phone is that its nearly stock android and all apps except a few can be removed completely from the device (for example i was able to remove the Google+ app which i was unable to do before). The phone is fast and fluid and i have not had any lagg on it. For me the camera is superb but I'm not a big photographer unless I'm at a concert or something. The auto-focus is extremely fast to where i don't even see it focus unless i manually use my finger to focus on a particular item. No regrets with my purchase"

Actually no its not just those two even if you open or use an app for a long time it overheats and this is a problem i've noticed in all xperia phones which is disappoint considering I absolutely love everything else about them. If this issue is fixed then this phone would be perfect but other than that nothing else has gave me problems."
"397025","Sony Xperia Z5 32GB GSM/LTE - Unlocked phone - (US Warranty)- Retail Packaging (Black)",2,"Coming from a Z3, I had very very high expectations, but due to the recent development of a flickering display issue, I decided to give the Z5 a chance.Within 3 hours of arrival, and fresh off a system update, the phone was shutting down the camera app due to thermal issues, and I was getting notifications about temperature problems. Whether I was taking 8mp images or 60fps full hd, same problem. If a phone's primary advertising feature is its camera's capabilities, those features should work.The display has a very odd tint to it, making whites appear red/purple, and giving other colors a weird cast, regardless of the xreality settings...maybe they put too much red in their Triluminos display technology...Adjusting the color calibration brings it closer to white, but gives things a greyish cast as well.While attempting to charge the phone using the supplied adapter, it was discharging faster than it could charge...all I was doing was downloading apps through google play, and had the screen on.Maybe I just got a dud, but Sony support killed it for me when their only solution was to check the return policy of the store from which I purchased, and then get sarcastic with me when I asked if that's all they were able to suggest.If this were priced as a midrange phone, I'd be more lenient, but at more than half a grand this is just unacceptable.Given that Sony has shuddered direct US sales of this phone, and their support is all overseas, I think I'm done with Sony Mobile. Too bad, too, cause the Z3 really was incredible."

"397028","Sony Xperia Z5 32GB GSM/LTE - Unlocked phone - (US Warranty)- Retail Packaging (Black)",4,"I was looking for a phone that had an aluminum body and was water resistant. I also wanted an unlocked phone because I do tend to leave the states every once and a while. I've had it about a month now and I am very please with it - the phone feels solid in your hand, it has a great weight to it. The camera is AWESOME with the quick auto-focus feature, the pictures are beautiful with a 23MP camera. The battery life is pretty good too, and it charges pretty quickly when using the factory charger, so if you're on the go you can squeeze in a few hours of battery life with 15 minutes of charging.I was a little apprehensive that the screen isn't gorilla glass; my screens tend to crack over time, which is why a screen protector and case were a MUST! This phone is SOLID, it does have a little software quirks since it is unlocked - like a 'Cell Information' notification that can be a bit of a pain to keep off the notification bar (If you want to remove it you have to go to Settings->Sound and Notifications->App Notifications->Cell Information->click on the i in a circle-> Force Stop -- the notification will come back upon restart); a small Snapchat quirk that makes you do a bit of extra work to get to the right screen (some of the menu options dont function on certain screens, you have to go to the main camera screen before being able to see other people's stories). I am sure there are other small app quirks too, but these small quirks are easy for me to look over for a great water-resistant aluminum bodied unlocked smartphone that costs under 500 bucks. Recommended for those that like solid unlocked android phones. Slap a screen protector on it, get a case, and live yo life like a boss with a new phone."

I have had iPhones and Galaxy phones in the past that have survived many falls with zero issues, but this Sony was unable to endure one fall.

I just had the all great and mighty Samsung S7 and I absolutely hated the phone! It ran a bit sluggish, in addition, out of the box the battery was horrible, and I am coming from the Sony Xperia Z3 which I only had to charge once a day. I returned the S7 $800 paperweight that T-Mobile attempted to charge me and decided to purchase the Xperia Z5 since I loved the Z3 so much, but with some of the negative reviews I almost did not purchased the phone. I am so happy that I did not listen to the negative reviews and did it. It has been less than 24hours and this phone is absolutely amazing! I have it running on T-Mobile’s sim card and the service is great, no overheating, in addition I purchased a solid case to keep this amazing phone protected. I think that this is the best phone on the market right now and I wish that people would provide accurate feedback so that others who want to take a chance will also have an amazing experience as I am having. Please, if you are thinking about this phone and already know how solid Sony is, don’t get despair by the negative reviews, take a chance on a brand that you know and get the phone! Life is too short to just settle for anything, treat yourself and live your life!"
"397042","Sony Xperia Z5 32GB GSM/LTE - Unlocked phone - (US Warranty)- Retail Packaging (Black)",5,"Coming from a Galaxy S3 (with Zerolemon extended battery) that lasted 3+ years, the difference between the two phones is night and day. Definitely larger, less curvy, and thinner. The Z5 feels very premium if not a little on the fragile side. I've heard reports in the past (especially with the Z3) of the screens self-cracking, so I wasn't going to take any chances with this phone. I also ordered a tempered glass screen protector and a clear TPU case and threw those on before anything else.It's only been a few days, and these are my observations thus far:Spent the first two days playing with the Z5 and updating it. An update was available right out of the box. This can be done either through the phone itself or by connecting it to the computer and installing Sony's Xperia Companion software (which I didn't mind.) There were a lot of features to play with. Won't be getting bored any time soon. One thing to note: the volume buttons are on the lower-right side of the phone, as opposed to the Galaxy S3's upper-left side. It takes some getting used to. Some have said that it's simply poor placement, but it's really not that bad. It might be annoying if you're right-handed, but I could see left-handers having an easier time. It's left-hander friendly! And for the record, I could care less about the lack of fingerprint scanner support. I don't think it's a needed feature, and definitely not a deal-breaker. My S3 didn't have one, so I don't believe I'm missing out.Today was my first real day of having it in my pocket while at work. I don't wear tight pants, but the phone is thinner than what I'm used to, so I remained aware of the potential of it bending in my pocket. I charged the phone overnight to 100%. As of this writing (around 4:13 PM), I'm down to 76%. Granted, I wasn't using the camera heavily or playing any games yet or had the screen on for a prolonged period of time. But as it stands, I can easily get two days out of this thing.Here's something of interest: I guess Android 6.0 has a feature called ""Double-tap to Wake"", where you can simply double-tap the display and it'll come on so you can unlock the device from there. Very nice feature! I always think that I'm wearing down the power button with the constant screen turning on and off. BUT, over the course of the work day and having the phone in my pocket, I noticed on two occasions that the flashlight mode was shining in my pocket. Somehow, it enabled itself in my pocket and I know I locked the device. I also noticed that my bluetooth was on, and I had no recollection of turning that on as well. I suspect that the ""Double-tap to Wake"" feature is so sensitive that it's turning on in my pocket, sliding around, and sliding the notification bar down and pressing random settings off and on. Even in my pocket, the screen must be very sensitive! There's apparently a ""Glove mode"" that makes it easier to interact with the screen while wearing gloves. This mode was turned off. I've since turned off the ""Double-tap to Wake"" feature. I'll report back if I'm still having issues with this."

"397057","Sony Xperia Z5 32GB GSM/LTE - Unlocked phone - (US Warranty)- Retail Packaging (Black)",1,"This review is after 3 months of ownership:The first few weeks I was pleased with the phone in general. All the basic performance requirements of a phone at the price point were met. After a few months of use, there have been some significant issues and I am now at a point where I need to replace the device all together. This is really disappointing because I usually get 2 to 3 product cycles out of a phone;I bought this to replace my S5 Galaxy. Here is a chronological list of issues developing1) 1 week - Blue tooth connectivity/call prioritization. Improved after system update2) 1 month - Overheating issues &coating on lens started to scratch off... The camera quality suffered as a result.3) 2 months - Vertical lines in the display when first turned on, that would fade away.4) 3 months - Vertical lines became like looking through a mesh, eventually the screen completely failed. It just displays lines and shades.I hope this helps, don't make the same mistake: buy a Samsung S7"

I just bought it in May 13th and for no reason it stopped working yesterday. It had 50% battery life and out of the blue it just blacked out and I was never able to turn it on again. I am in U.S. for a limited period of time to visit my family and it is so frustrating because all the memories I had with my family in this trip were gone with the phone.I would like to know what Amazon is going to do about it because I am leaving the country in a week and I feel completely deceived."

And i don't blame sony for this. for couple of years, Android cellphones industry is in static situation and nothing new or awesome is coming out. every renowned brand's flagship phones are circling around, camera, water proof, sound, finger prints, resolution etc. nothing special or extra ordinary coming out. i gave 4 stars because battery life is not improved, i was expecting better performance in battery life."

I finally got it through Amazon, and this phone is absolutely blazing fast! However the number the Sony Guy provided me to purchase an additional warranty didn't pan out, I still feel this phone deserves a full 5 star review. The camera, the graphics, the power, The playstation integration for gamers, this phone is exactly what I have been waiting for to upgrade for my trusty Xperia Play R800 and I couldn't be happier. Unless of course it slid out into a PlayStation controller like the old R800's but the display, camera, and about everything else make this phone so vastly superior in every aspect. I'm not even mad the U.S. version didn't get a finger print scanner as there is a ton of apps for that, and that wasn't a selling point anyways for me. I am in love all over again with another great Xperia!"

Huge upgrade from the Sony Xperia Z3V that I previously was using, so it is actually my first time using Lollipop and also many other features that the Z5 has to offer. Buttery Smooth performance along with speed and the camera is just amazing, so many great things about this phone that I can go on about. I have read that people are upset about Sony not including the fingerprint scanner from the power button which to me is not a big deal since I have not yet to use it on my previous devices so I honestly could care less of the feature and I also doubt that I would ever use it if it was included. However this phone is great and I am enjoying it."
"397084","Sony Xperia Z5 32GB GSM/LTE - Unlocked phone - (US Warranty)- Retail Packaging (Black)",5,"I am impressed with the quality of this phone,The Xperia Z5 display excellent color reproduction and sharpness, has an excellent image, the glass screen feels sturdy, the software and hardware environment respond quickly and smooth, I have been using continuously and has no overheating by the continued use of streaming as z3,The Xperia Z5 is very well put together, with Gorilla Glass 4 on the front and back, an aluminum frame and rubber bumpers on the corners to help absorb shock if the phone is dropped,The camera has truly excellent auto-focus,regarding the battery of sony phone I do not see a big difference compared to other phones like Samsung or IPhone S6,but The biggest departure in design terms, is the look of the power button. Sony’s trademark protruding chrome-effect circle, which has been around for years, has now been replaced by an elongated lozenge, slightly inset from the edge to prevent you accidentally pressing it.I particularly recommend this phone to a friend."
"397085","Sony Xperia Z5 32GB GSM/LTE - Unlocked phone - (US Warranty)- Retail Packaging (Black)",5,"Upgraded to this phone from a T-Mobile Xperia Z (3 1/2 years old) which was locked; therefore I'm using the unlocked Z5 on T-Mobile and have not had any issues. I have a LTE signal on the device. One of the biggest pros for the phone is that its nearly stock android and all apps except a few can be removed completely from the device (for example i was able to remove the Google+ app which i was unable to do before). The phone is fast and fluid and i have not had any lagg on it. For me the camera is superb but I'm not a big photographer unless I'm at a concert or something. The auto-focus is extremely fast to where i don't even see it focus unless i manually use my finger to focus on a particular item. No regrets with my purchase"
"397086","Sony Xperia Z5 32GB GSM/LTE - Unlocked phone - (US Warranty)- Retail Packaging (Black)",5,"Received the phone yesterday and it is as expected. I haven't gotten the device soaked yet but it is fast, runs cool, and the display looks great even in direct daylight. Didn't get outrageously warm and the battery life looks like it will outperform what reviews led me to expect. I didn't really care about or want the finger print scanner so I am not torn up about that. The phone itself is understated ""chic"" I suppose. Its solid in the hand, has a nice little loop notch which was an unexpected surprise that will probably go unused here.I am particularly impressed with the headphone output on this phone. resolution and quality of output are on par with an HTC One M8. The M8 has the edge in absolute power output but this phone is capable of making good use of a Tidal account on the go. Has enough power to drive the Shure Srh-1840 to uncomfortable levels. Doesn't seem to mind hte ultra-low impedance of the Shure SE846 although absolute refinement of sound seems to take a slight hit compared to the HTC one M8. Four hours of Tidal streaming @ CD quality seemed to eat about 10% of the phones battery driving the SRH-1840 and the screen mostly off which I consider to be another solid showing.Especially for the money, I feel its quite a nice device."

I understand some people like big phones, however, that's not my preference. That's why when the S5 came out, I started looking for something else. Then I found the Sony's Xperia Z Compact phones. I had originally wanted the Z3+ (Z4 elsewhere), but right when I was about to buy it, the Z5 Compact came out. While it's not available in the US via normal retailers, I was able to get a warranty for it via SquareTrade. So that made it a no brainer for me. I've had it for a few months now and I'm still loving it."
"397088","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact E5823 2GB/32GB 23MP 4.6-inch 4G LTE Factory Unlocked (BLACK) - International Stock No Warranty",4,"EDIT (1/9/16): My original evaluation of this phone remains the same but I would encourage people to look at the HTC One A9 as it addresses the US compatability aspect while still being pocketable. It is not as compact as the Z5c, meaning Sony is still the only name in the game but the A9 is still manageable. You can read my review here: https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B017D554UKI have been through every phone you can imagine and the Sony Xperia Compact line continues to impress me. I recently had a Nexus 6p and Nexus 5x and the sizes are just to much for me. Yes, I really want Marshmallow but can wait an extra few weeks for it. I asked a few questions before buying and had trouble getting clear information due to the technical nature, but wanted to clarify for those who are looking.This phone is almost fully compatible with T-Mobile USA and I can confirm Band 12 (Extended Range LTE) *does* work (confirmed with LTE Discovery). However, there is no HD Voice, VoLTE or WiFi Calling. For me, these trade-offs were well worth it because of the phenomenal battery life (which will likely get better on Marshmallow), the compact form factor and water resistance (just nice to have as a backup). If WiFi calling is an issue for you, you can use something like Hangouts phone calls as a backup. It is of course not as convenient, but it works. HD Voice is only compatible T-Mobile <> T-Mobile and, yes, you can tell the difference and I wish I had it - but again, not a huge trade-off. VoLTE is the one that gets me. For those of you that don't know, this means the phone drops your data down to 3G/HSPA when making a phone call. Not the end of the world but you may notice the difference when navigating, tethering to your PC, trying to navigate, etc. Again, you could get around this by using a third-party dialer (Hangouts) since that is a VoIP call but for most people, this may be overkill. I suspect though most people buying this phone are pretty familiar with these things since the phone is not advertised in the US. The lack of VoLTE/WiFi Calling/HD Voice is the only reason I knocked off a star.Note the phone comes with an international charger and adapter. It is compatible with QuickCharge technology and charges rapidly for example with this Swiftrans 3221263 Quick Charge 2.0 36W Dual Ports USB Car ChargerThe camera on the phone is pretty good - not the best - but will be fine for 9/10 people.I am using the phone with Aomax® For Sony Xperia Z5 Compact / Mini Tempered Glass Screen Protector [Superslim 0.26mm,2.5D Round Edge,9H Hardness] [Retail Package] For(Sony Xperia Z5 Compact / Mini) and Orzly® - FlexiSlim Case for SONY XPERIA Z5 COMPACT (2015 SmartPhone Model / Smallest Version / XPERIA Z5 MINI) - Super Slim (0.35mm) Protective Phone Cover in Semi Transparent WHITE. It was important to me I protected the device but didn't go overboard on the bulkiness - the combination of these two are perfect. I have reviewed each of these independently but included one picture here of the phone, glass and case together.Overall this is an awesome phone for people who aren't concerned about buying direct from a carrier and don't want a huge phone."

If you are in the US be prepared to run into small workable issues. I use AT&T and the company was great in supporting the unlocked phone, setting me up with a visit to the distribution office for the Nano-sim install and activation. The issues I am talking about is the distribution centers have no experience with this phone and had no idea how to move the data from my old Samsung Rugby (smart phone version) to the new phone, how to install the Nano Sim or the SD card. Since AT&T will not allow two phones to be active at the same time I could not download the Xperia App to the old phone --- you must do this prior to deactivating the old sim --- via Google play, a similar app is needed for Bluetooth transfer --- the only option to find and buy the Xperia data cable and try that. For those reading this and are thinking that all I have to do is to remove the SD card from the old Samsung Rugby which is also an Android device with all the latest updates. It doesn’t work, the Xperia Z5 compact rejected the phone contacts as not being in the right format. What the heck? The Samsung Rugby (smart phone version) does not use the *.vcf format and will not transfer to the Xperia.Even if I have to transfer all my contacts to my new Xperia Z5 Compact manually I’m willing to do so. This phone supports amazingly clear conversations using Bluetooth headset, speaker-phone, or near the face, the camera is outstanding. Even though there are complaints of the 780 display I don’t see it. I am very happy with a phone that is not tethered to a charging dock every few hours. I have to ask, if wireless means you are not connected to an RJ jack but are tethered to a charger all the time what is the difference? Bonus, with the reasonable screen size I do not have to hire a porter and baggage cart to haul it around, it fits into my pocket, imagine that!"

"397093","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact E5823 2GB/32GB 23MP 4.6-inch 4G LTE Factory Unlocked (BLACK) - International Stock No Warranty",3,"TL;DR PRO/CON list at bottom.I will start off this review by saying that I really wanted to love this phone. It does have some very good qualities about it. But the phone has its faults, which are enough for me to not give this phone a recommendation. I have used the phone for approximately 6 months.By background is that I worked in the cell phone industry selling phones for years, before moving into corporate IT and networking. I have been a amateur phone enthusiast and have easily had over 30 phones in my day. I also take exceptional care of my belongings, electronics getting special care. Seeing as this phone is a bit expensive for the size, it was a bit of a treat for myself as the specs and design looked like everything I wanted.HardwareScreen is a nice size for one handed use. Is very crisp and easy to see inside and outside in bright sunlight. Physical buttons are a tad awkward being so low on the device, but worked well for how I hold a phone. They provide enough click, but are a little hard to ""feel out"" and press during a call. Volume on the dual speakers is adequate for a small phone and produce decent sound. Sound through earphones is very good. 2 GB of RAM is more than enough to power the 720p screen and the 810 processor never lets up. The fingerprint scanner is top notch. Works very fast and recognizes fingers well. It allows 5 fingers to be registered. I did my wife's thumb, left index, right index, and my right thumb twice for better accuracy on my main digit. Sometimes I would pull the phone out of my pocket and it would already have registered my thumb and unlocked itself.UI, Performance, and Battery LifeThis phone came with Android Lollipop and is now updated to Marshmallow. The UI runs well. The fast processor and 2 GB of RAM don't let this phone slow down much if at all. Sony's take on Android is a very clean and minimal. Although there is plenty of Sony ""bloatware"" apps that come preinstalled and cannot be removed. You can ""disable"" them so they are no longer active and don't appear in the menu, but still live on the device. The Snapdragon 810 does still tend to get hot at random times. An app may be running in the background and you can feel the phone get much warmer. Never hot that you feel in danger, but warm enough to warranty a reboot in my opinion. Once back up the device was cool again. Battery life on the phone is decent, but not close to the expectation that Sony has set with previous devices in the series. It will get you through a day easily with moderate to heavy use, and can easily stretch to two days with light use. Recharge time however is very long. If you plug into a PC to charge expect at least 3 - 4 hours to charge it up. A quick charge adapter is a wise investment if you get this phone.Apps and GamingI largely got this phone for remote play on the PS4; that feature worked wonderfully with no issues. While the small screen was a little hard to see at times, I never had an issue with pairing the PS4 controller via bluetooth or playing over WiFi. The stock messaging app always gave me trouble with MMS messages, even with the correct settings from AT&T. I constantly got a you have an MMS to download message even though I already read the message. Textra fixed that issue and is a much better messaging app in my opinion. I don't really play any other types of mobile games, but companion apps for Destiny, Metal Gear Solid V, and standard apps like The Weather Channel all ran great on the device. As mentioned before there is A LOT of Sony branded items that are just flat out annoying and not needed.CameraWonderful camera. Loved to take pictures with this phone. They almost always come out clear and sharp. With the latest updates the camera opens quickly. The phone does a good job of fast auto-focus as promised. The shutter key on the side of the device is great for open the camera quickly and nice to take a picture. Finger placement while holding the phone is a bit awkward as the camera is very close the the top edge of the phone and gets covered easy if you are not careful. I spent most of my time in superior auto mode which produces 8 mp images. Going into manual will give you an overwhelming amount of options and allow full 23 mp pictures.DesignLooking at the phone it screams premium. Add waterproofing to the device and that is just piece of mind that some rain or accidental spills will not harm the device. No flap for the charge port is also wonderful as I've seen my share of them get damaged on phone such as the Galaxy S5 which kills the waterproofing of the device. The phone has a heafty weight to it that also feels good. The frosted glass back looks very nice and does not attract fingerprints. The phone is very slippery. On a scale of 1 to 10 with 1 being course grit sand paper and 10 being metal coated in Teflon covered in olive oil, this phone is a 9 easy. The phone literally wants to slide out of your hand whenever you hold it. If nothing else a case is needed to provide some grip to the phone. Having a glass front and back also made me extra cautious and nervous about potential cracks. But I have always taken care of my devices and never cracked a screen.Phone callsPhone calls on the device were clean on my end every time. There were issues for the other caller especially when I used speaker phone. Callers would often complain that they heard themselves or that they could not hear me until I went back to the earpiece. It also appeared that using the speaker phone only used the bottom speaker and not both.DurabilityThis phone is by its very nature fragile. With over 90% of the outer casing being glass, you better believe this baby is delicate. The phone came with a pre-installed screen protector, but it became cruddy very fast. I normally don't use a screen protector and have never had an issue. I somehow managed to put a small scratch on the screen while it was in my pocket with NOTHING else in it one day while hiking. It was no big deal, as I couldn't see it when the screen was on, but I knew it was there and worried me that it got damaged so easily. Now just recently a friend placed my phone near a counter edge, and a got a few messages in a row that made the device vibrate right off the edge. Of course it landed face down on kitchen tile. Screen completely shattered and the touch screen stopped functioning altogether. I am not knocking this phone because of my stupid mistake, not many phones if any would survive a fall like that. Instead it just goes to show that a rugged case is just about required for this device. Which is a huge bummer since the phone looks so good.TL;DR and PROS/CONS ListPROS-- Nice screen for a smaller phone-- Beautiful design-- Great camera-- Fast performance-- Sony's UI has a good design-- Waterproof-- Native PS4 remote playCons-- Sony bloatware that cannot be removed, just disabled-- Slippery-- Fragile-- Poor speaker phone quality for the other caller-- Awkward button placement-- Very slow charge time-- Expensive-- Sony is slow to update UIConclusion and thoughtsThe phone is not worth the price. The camera is very nice and waterproofing is a big plus, but a few nice features do not outweigh the fact you are terrified to accidentally drop such an expensive phone. If you don't let anyone else touch this phone, and put it in a really hard-core case, it may last you a good while. If you live in the real world where you may leave you phone on a desk, give it to someone to take a picture of you, or bump into something with the phone in your pocket it may be dropped and will break."

Compact size without sacrificing CPU and other features like most other ""mini"" phones. I am using this on AT&T in the USA.Pros:- Battery life is astounding. I usually go to bed with ~40% battery after a day of use.- Compact size - so awesome. Hate how big most phones are these days, this is the perfect size for me- Fast. ""Flagship"" phone specs but in a compact size.- Fingerprint scanner. Love this. I hate lock screens but I am required to use them for a few apps, and company policy. Fingerprint scanner works pretty well.- Smart lock - nice feature that is new to me. Auto-unlocks the phone based on certain conditions, such as if certain bluetooth devices are connected, by location (while at home for example) and/or other criteria. Makes having a lock screen much less of a pain.- Dedicated camera button, press and hold to power on the phone and open camera, nice for quick photos- Dual front-facing speakers. Very loud, sound is decent, a bit tinny, but that's expected from such a small device.- Great screen, very clear and bright, no complaints there- Did I mention it's tiny?Cons:- Camera is pretty mediocre. I'm not a big camera user but for some this may be a dealbreaker. My 4 year old HTC One M7 took far better pictures.- Now that I've had it several months, the fingerprint scanner is getting a little glitchy. Most of the time a reboot fixes the problem, but usually comes back after a couple days. Definitely annoying.- Case options are pretty limited, and many of them cover the power button therefore disabling the use of the fingerprint scanner.- 720p resolution. Honestly I don't consider this a downside at all, who wants to watch 1080p video on a 4"" screen anyway. But for some, resolution is important.- Personally I don't like the factory dialer. I almost always dial by number and this one pulls up a list of contacts by default and takes an extra tap to get the keypad. Slightly annoying, but easily fixed with 3rd-party dialers in the Play store.- Gorilla Glass. Hotly debated, but this phone doesn't have it. Sony uses their own proprietary tempered glass, supposedly just as scratch-resistant as Gorilla Glass. I've own the phone for 3 months now and have zero scratches, and survived a couple drops."

From the beginning the phone was a little slow to respond in many ways but I could deal with it. About 3 months ago the camera stopped working entirely. I called customer support and was told to do a soft reset, then hard reset. Neither of those worked.I asked about sending the phone in for repair and was informed that because this model came from Hong Kong, that they could not repair it, it is not covered under warranty, I would have to contact the Hong Kong customer service. I have been back and forth between both Hong Kong and US customer service, both of them just give me the run around and refuse to take responsibility for their faulty product, and will not repair it. After contacting the US customer service again, they advised me to do a software repair. I followed the steps and now my phone is entirely stuck on the beginning intro screen and will not function at all. In other words, right now I paid over $500.00 for a non functioning phone with Sony refusing to fix their faulty product.This phone is a giant lemon, and after dealing with Sonys customer service I will never purchase a Sony product again."

I've only owned Nexi before this, but I find Sony's customizations are almost all additive, like glove mode or being able to reboot or screenshot with a click of the power button. Any uninstallable apps you don't like, just disable in Settings.I use mine without a case and with a lanyard (not included, but I bought some silver ones on Amazon for about $5), which adds no bulk, keeps the phone pure but like a case, offers (preventative) protection against drops. Some have complained about the ""lip"" of the outer frame, but I don't find it remotely bothersome in hand and it protects the glass. It's functional - something any great design must be, not just beautiful. I laugh at all the iPhones wearing ugly cases.I have noticed a couple of intermittent software bugs here & there (example: blacks sometimes look gray when waking from sleep and auto-adjust brightness is on) but nothing I can't live with, and Sony has OTA-air shipped both a firmware and a camera update in the month I've owned the phone.Battery life is great, solidly over a day with moderatly heavy screen-on time use and up to two days with Stamina mode enabled.Just buy it.

It's only a little customised from stock Android and isn't always trying to sell you stuff like a Samsung device. The bloatware isn't too bad either and can be disabled. Sony includes a free service to locate, lock, or wipe your lost phone. Also software to copy over your old data. Very useful.Battery life really is good. My first day, it lasted until night which is quite good doing all of the setup and playing around. Under normal usage I have about 40% left at the end of the day--Wow! STAMINA mode seems really usable too for special times when you need extra battery life.The phone is small and very portable. It's not wafer thin, probably because of a larger battery. I don't find the thickness to be too much. Of course, with the smaller size you get a smaller screen. Is it worth the trade-off? Only you can decide.Performance is fast and flawless, which is unparalleled in a small phone. It doesn't seem to get particularly hot.The screen looks beautiful and the pixel density is plenty.I love the fingerprint sensor! Works great and so conveniently located. It's a shame they couldn't include this feature on the US model. I had Android encrypt the device for security, no problems.Volume control buttons seemed oddly placed at first, but they are out of the way and how often do you use them? Not that much.Camera, although it could be improved, is very usable as a compact camera. Dedicated camera button is very nice. Picture quality good, shutter delay fair.Water and dust sealing should be on EVERY phone. Great how it doesn't have fiddly flaps to cover all the ports.Audio quality is excellent and seems better than my old Samsung phone.No US warranty is unfortunate. If it breaks, I plan to pay for any repairs. I can live with the risk as a trade-off for the fingerprint scanner.Earbuds were included; thank you, Sony.Included charger had the international prong setup and included adapter for US outlets. Works fine, I have other chargers that work just as fine. Sometime I'll probably pick up a Quick Charge 2.0 charger.Overall, a super package! I'm so happy with it."

Button layout is perfect for one hand use. Bezel space is small, front stereo speakers are cool.Software wise... This phone is a joke. I had low expectations going in but was surprised at how bad it really is. The camera sucks, theres no way to say it's good at anything. Stereo speakers on front aren't same volume so it's a rather odd sound when viewing videos. Luminosity of auto brightness is all over the place, all of the time. And then there's overheating. The 810 in here should have been called dragons breath because it leaves the phone inoperable at times. I haven't shot 4k video or even played games yet and it gets above 170 just browsing the web. Charging the phone gets it to about 140 also.. and if you get a phone call or have to actually touch the phone, you get burned.All in all,if you're not a heavy user or you are coming from an iPhone, you'll probably like it.

As a consumer, I'm incredibly attentive to the small details in a product, and if the issue is annoying enough, I'll return it. Not so with the Xperia Z5 Compact (Z5c from here on). In more detail below:DISPLAY:Stunning LCD with virtually no light bleed. Colors are well saturated, and almost approach AMOLED in the level of depth. Whites are accurate, and text overall is sharp. I prefer AMOLED for the true blacks, but this is a very solid LCD. If I had one complaint, it's that the circuitry is sometimes visible in bright light behind the display.DESIGN:The phone fits in the hand very well. The sides are very easy to grip on to, and the frosted finish on the back glass is a huge improvement over the previous Xperia devices. The fingerprint scanner on the power button is extremely accurate and fast. I would have placed the volume button a bit higher than Sony did, however. I haven't tested the waterproofing, but it's a useful feature to have.PERFORMANCE:I was concerned at first about the Snapdragon 810 in the device, and heat issues, but so far, I haven't felt any extreme heating. It does definitely get warm during use, but no more than say, a Samsung Galaxy S6. It's very fast, and for gaming, the 720p display serves it well. Some users have reported performance issues or lagging through the UI, particularly when an SD card is inserted, though I've not noticed any of these. I also have had no issues with streaming Bluetooth audio.BATTERY:I don't think this device will last 2 days on a single charge, though it absolutely can get through a single day's use. I spend roughly half of my day in a low signal area, which I expect would affect this, and thus, lower the battery life. In a stronger signal environment, it would probably last longer.CAMERA:The camera is excellent. The photos are crisp, and sharp on most subjects. Low-light performance could be better, but I have no real complaints with the camera.MISC:It doesn't support Wi-Fi calling, or VoLTE on T-Mobile, though I doubt this can be helped, considering it's an international model.Overall, this is the best option if you're looking for a compact Android device. I'm certainly keeping it."

Since they already detail the good parts, I'll spare you the extra words.That said, its battery life, size, and camera quality are marred by mediocre Bluetooth performance, camera app unresponsiveness, and poor stability.I've noticed Bluetooth audio with aptX can stutter. While it only happens twice in the included demo video (at 0:44 and 1:10), it can happen rather frequently if there's a lot going on in the background. It's very distracting whenever it happens. I strongly believe that the issue lies with the Z5C's aptX codec:* The headphones in question are the Plantronics BackBeat PRO Wireless Noise Canceling Hi-Fi Headphones with Mic - Compatible with iPhone, iPad, Android, and Other Smart Devices. In my testing, they work fine on the Nexus 4 and OnePlus One (Android phones that *don't* support aptX), and on an iPad and MacBook Pro (Apple devices that *do* support aptX).* Additionally, all of the non-aptX receivers I've tried with this phone work fine. As of this writing, this includes the Amazon Echo, Honda CR-V HandsFreeLink, JayBird BBX1MB BlueBuds X Sport Bluetooth Headphones - Black (Discontinued by Manufacturer), and the HomeSpot NFC-Enabled Bluetooth Audio Receiver for Sound System.Despite the inclusion of a Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 in the phone, it's not very responsive. While taking a video, the camera app appears to stutter and drop a few frames every few seconds. It can be very difficult to stop taking a video - the phone will appear to still be capturing frames, but pressing the stop button can occasionally do nothing. Once the phone is in this state, nothing on the screen will respond including the back, home, and task switcher buttons (even though the camera still updates as you move the phone around). The only way out is to hard reboot (which can take up to three minutes if you have device encryption enabled). If you close the camera using the home button or the task switcher, the rest of the phone becomes very slow until you reopen the camera and close it using the back button.As for stability, I'll just leave the text of my initial 1-star review here:After successfully using this phone for navigation, I put it back in my pocket. When I took it out an hour later, it wouldn't turn back on. I could tell it wasn't a suddenly dead battery because the phone vibrated whenever I put my finger on the fingerprint sensor. I tried a hard reboot by removing and replacing the SIM card and the phone has been unresponsive since then.This is a real shame especially because there are no other decent phones on the market at this form factor (except maybe the Z3 Compact, which I've seen run into the exact same problem).Eventually I figured out that the problem was because Android crashed pretty hard since pressing and holding the ""OFF"" button hidden behind the SIM/SD cover brought the phone back to a working state."

The small compact size is perfect for me and I don't mind the thickness, I assume it's thicker than most to put that bigger battery in. I thought it would be hard to go small since I'm coming from the iPhone 6 Plus, but wasn't bad at all in my opinion. This is actually the first android phone that I can say I won't be going back to my iPhone. I get about 1 1/2 days of battery life at moderate use. so far my screen on time averages 4 hours, best was 4 hours 45 minutes. My last android phone was the 2015 moto x pure and that battery life was horrible along with others I have owned, nexus 5x, Htc one m7, m8, m9, nexus 5, and so on which always made me go back to my iPhone along with other reasons. I am in the United States and with At&t and can confirm LTE works perfectly. No issues at all. Also I didn't have to manually put in the APN for mms or Internet to work, u just make sure u have wifi connected and then go to settings, then more, then scroll down and hit internet settings. Hit download and it will automatically download the correct settings for your carrier, make sure your carrier sim is installed. The camera is good enough for me, I'm no professional photographer so I just leave it in superior auto mode and it takes good pics in my opinion. I can confirm the phone back does get a little warm during some situations. First one was downloading all my apps from the play store at the same time. 2nd is using hangouts for video calls, other than that it has been fine. The heat it did get did not burn my hand and was still comfortable to hold and use. I did get the DP glass screen protector which I put on all my phones and I like it. I'm not a case kind of guy so waiting on my dbrand skin. I did get the white version and I have not had any screen issues or my on screen buttons not working on my bed. I assume others just got a defective unit. I got usb cord, earbuds, and a international plug in the box. Just a side not I only have one hand and am super happy that a company actually makes a one handed device with great specs. Most android phones I've had one handed use was very difficult if not impossible but had no choice if wanted top specs, so thank you Sony for high end specs in a compact size."

"397147","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact E5823 2GB/32GB 23MP 4.6-inch 4G LTE Factory Unlocked (BLACK) - International Stock No Warranty",1,"I bought this phone as a replacement for my Z1 which I had for over two and half years. I had zero issues with it until I shattered the screen. The Xperia line of phones are touted as being waterproof or at least they were initially. Sony seems to have shied away from that position now and for good reason. You see, I originally bought the Z1 for three main reasons: the 20mp camera, water resistance, build quality. My experience with the Z1 lead me to believe that the Z5c would be a suitable replacement. I assumed that the Z5c would certainly exceed the standards set by the Z1. I was wrong.Firstly, the positives1) The camera of the Z5c does outperform the Z1's especially in low light conditions. The overall picture quality is only slightly better, however.2) The UI is smoother and faster, likely due to the more powerful CPU3) Slightly better battery life4) Twice the storage capacity5) No flap cover for the USB slot6) Louder speakersThe negatives1) Plastic frame. The phone feels cheap compared to the Z1. It also is less damage resistant than the metal Z12) Frosted glass back plate. While it looks nice, it makes the phone slick and therefore harder to hold3) Build quality and water resistanceI assumed that the Z5c would be even more watertight than the Z1 since it has a higher IP certification. Nope. Even though I swam with my Z1 dozens of times, occasionally exceeding its depth rating, I never once had any issues. I would even wash it in the sink weekly. The phone was waterproof until I broke the screen. The Z5c, on the other hand, died the very moment it touched water. It was thoroughly waterlogged as if it lacked a water resistant seal entirely.Sony's repair service only made matters worse. They claimed that my Z5c was made for the Polish market (what?) and that there are no repair centers in the US. I was given an address in England to ship it and they said they would pay for Royal Mail shipping. Naturally, they could not seeing as how there are no Royal Mail offices in the US. Despite paying for shipping, Sony fixed the phone free of charge since it was under warranty. The turn around time was a bit over a month. I believe I got lucky as I have read that Sony will not honor warranty claims that are the result of water damage.So I go to turn the phone on and all seems well. At this point, I'm just glad to finally have my phone back. However, to my dismay the volume key does not work. They replaced the screen along with many internal components and performed a diagnostics test and yet somehow the broken volume key passed the test. What the heck. Every Xperia phone lets you run a simple pass/fail diagnostic test in the settings menu. One of the tests is for the volume rocker key. I don't understand how they missed this.I reached out to Sony again who said to ship the phone to them. And so I did. Over three weeks went by before I asked them for a status update. They told me they did not receive my phone. Strange. USPS stated that it passed customs and marked it as delivered. A couple more weeks go by before I receive an international package at my door. I thought maybe they had fixed my phone without notifying me. A foolish thought. What happened was that the Sony Service Center refused to take possession of the package so it was returned to me. Apparently there was a customs fee that they would not pay, despite stating that they would pay for shipping both ways. Since I paid for shipping to them both times they could have at least paid the measly fee. Why would Sony pays for it the first time but not the second? I asked USPS if I could pay the fee upfront and I was told I cannot.I've had it with Sony. Clearly the quality of their phones isn't what it used to be, not to mention the quality of their customer service. I'll update this review if Sony rectifies the situation. Don't hold your breath though."

Fits well into any pocket, including women's jeans! (This was a problem for me with larger phones.) Fingerprint scanner is a great feature and the camera is great; I haven't tested how waterproof it is yet, but it's nice to not worry about it in rain etc. Software all runs smoothly and I have yet to come up on anything the phone struggles to do.Rated down by 1 star as it tends to heat up and drain battery relatively quickly, though. It's excellent in 60º (F) weather where the air temp naturally compensates, but as it gets up to 80s or 90s the battery just burns up if you're using the screen a lot."
"397153","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact E5823 2GB/32GB 23MP 4.6-inch 4G LTE Factory Unlocked (BLACK) - International Stock No Warranty",5,"OK I didn't wanna post any review within a few days of my possession to avoid looking like snap judgment. So I had this phone for about a month now and I gotta say I'm very pleased with it. The display is so beautiful and the clarity is high. Even on low brightness. I thought the screen might be too small for me but it's perfect. I have small hands myself. Now I don't have to stretch my thumb across the screen to text messages. I can text comfortably with one hand. The battery life is just AWESOME!!!! Coming from a MOTO X that could barely last one day, I was afraid the battery life won't be as good for this phone. And I was so wrong. I can easily use this device for two and half days straight without charging it. That includes internet browsing, data using, video and music usage, picture taking and basic calling/texting. Remember still turn off your phone once awhile, it's like a computer, it needs to rest sometime. Anyhow, the only thing that is not too great about this phone is the camera. Don't get me wrong. It takes great and clear pictures. I like the feature that you can choose what to focus when there are multiple things in one frame. The shutter speed sucks. It takes a few seconds for a photo to take a photo. That was pretty disappointing. I did insert a SD card later on and it did help with the speed a little but not too much. But out of all the good things about this phone, I can let one slide. Nothing is perfect right?"
"397154","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact E5823 2GB/32GB 23MP 4.6-inch 4G LTE Factory Unlocked (BLACK) - International Stock No Warranty",4,"Purchased on February, now reviewing during August.The Sony Z5 Compact is a great little device with plenty of powerful features.Specs:2GB ramQualcomm Snapdragon 81023 MP Back Camera (wow!)5 MP Front CameraMicro USB Charging Port4.6 inch Touch Screen DisplayIP 68 Waterproof, Dust proof, etc.Micro SD and Nano SIm card slotsReview:Wow!, I'm surprised Sony was able to compact their larger Z5 into such a small body that is convenient for your pocket and your hand. It is truly some remarkable engineering. Well, that compact size does have a drawback that may put some people off which is that it is a blocky/bulky phone. Even though it is a blocky/bulky phone, I always managed to get a nice firm grip because of the size and bulk of the phone. The screen size is perfect in my opinion for the size of this phone which is the same screen size for the iPhone 6/6s. The phone is also waterproof and dustproof which was sort of a minor, yet surprising, thing that Sony would usually put on their phones that is beginning to be used by other phone companies such as Samsung. The Camera packs 23 MP which is quite surprising for the size of the phone. The camera takes good pictures and good videos, HOWEVER, in only good lighting. If you take pictures in the dark, It will appear murky and pixelated. The phone's software experience has been vastly improved from its early beginnings and has lost almost all of its setbacks it had when it started. Sony's android skin is fast and simple, offering a near stock Android Marshmallow experience. The Speakers produce good sound but are located in the most convenient location that most phone companies ignore. The speakers are located in the front with one on top near the camera and one on the bottom. This means you don't cover the speakers when ever you're watching a video in landscape. Most companies put the speakers at the bottom of the phone next to the Micro USB charging port. The biggest grip of the phone is the processor that is encased in it which is the Qualcomm Snapdragon 810. This CPU has a well known record of producing more heat than most of other CPUs in the market. This CPU is very powerful and still relevant even with Qualcomm's new CPU the Snapdragon 820, but it just gets hot very quickly. The heat isn't hot to the touch where it is unbearable it just gets warm when gaming, browsing the web, watching videos, etc. The battery life on this phone is great and it usually has enough charge to last me for a whole day and some the day afterwards. This is, However, if you utilize Sony's STAMINA Battery saver feature. You can still get a whole days worth without it, but you will probably have to cut back on CPU intensive tasks. Overall, this phone offers the strength and speed of its older counterpart(Z5) in a neat little package that doesn't make it uncomfortable in the pocket.Pros:Speed and power( CPU).Small and convenient package.Great front and back cameras.Great battery life.Speaker location is very good and sound great.Waterproof.Cons:CPU gets warm very quicklyCamera quality isn't very good in low light conditions.The thickness of the phone may put off some people.Will Update if necessary."

The z1c had the highest build quality in my opinion (the metal casing exuding the appearance of ""high-end""). The z5c is a step down from here, although the performance is updated, the phone does not look or feel high-end in your palm. This isn't a huge deal to me as I primarily use this phone for travel; the small size, waterproofing, and low-key appearance are all assets. However unlike the z1c, I don't enjoy using the z5c at home in the states. One big gripe for me has been the fingerprint scanner. The iPhone will read and unlock my prints 90% of the time, the z5c is probably more like 60% for me. I'm sure experiences will vary.In all its a mediocre phone, but given the choices out there, it is by far the best Android in this size. The vanilla-like Android experience Sony installs is appreciated as well-- its the closest you can get out of the box without buying a Nexus imho."

"397160","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact E5823 2GB/32GB 23MP 4.6-inch 4G LTE Factory Unlocked (BLACK) - International Stock No Warranty",5,"I bought this for my wife, to replace her (still functional, just aging) Moto G LTE (1st Gen). If you're looking at this product, you're probably aware of the general lack of high-end, small-form-factor Android phones. If you want high-end, you usually have to get something substantially larger than this, and my wife did not want a larger phone. She also wanted something with a much better camera. The z5 compact delivers. She's had it a month now, and she likes it a lot. (I've used it quite a bit as well). The camera is responsive and extremely high quality - it does fairly well in low light as well. The battery life is nothing short of outstanding. Sony's take on Android squashes battery consumption when the phone is idle, even with background apps (facebook messenger, facebook, various google services) all running. I've used a moto x (1st gen), moto x (2nd gen), moto g LTE (1st gen) all recently -- this phone has markedly better battery life than those. It's also stable and fast - the only (very) minor gripe one could have about this phone is Sony's mild modification to the UI, which is not stock. I don't really like the blue menu bars on settings & so on, but once the thing is set up, you shouldn't have to go in to those... so this is mostly a nonissue. Also, the Sony/xperia migration tool made migrating sms messages, pictures, and so on a breeze. This phone is fantastic.Regarding cell coverage and compatibility, we use this phone with Cricket Wireless, which is an AT&T MVNO. The ""bars"" meter apparently is calibrated a bit lower than other phones (ie, displaying 3 bars vs 4, etc), but the actual dB reading is the same as my moto phones on the same carrier in the same location. I'd expect this phone to work absolutely fine with post-paid AT&T service as well, seeing as how it works without issue on their prepaid subsidiary. I cannot vouch for whether or not the carriers can actually activate a new SIM on this phone, however -- I took her old SIM (already activated), cut it, and put it in this phone, which worked fine. I did have to put in the access point (AP) settings, but that's standard practice if you're used to Cricket or other prepaid carriers.re: warranty, I get squaretrade warranties for phones anyway. I'm not sweating the alleged lack of US warranty, though other reports are mixed as to whether Sony would really give you the cold shoulder if you had a legitimate hardware issue with the device.The phone came with an international AC converter to convert it to US 120V to... something else. I live in the United States. I'm not intimately familiar with exactly what kind of converter this is. It comes with a US 120V to USB charger in the box, and then is bundled with this international AC-to-US120V-AC adapter outside. It also has a pair of earbuds in the box."

The phone is smaller than most smart phones these days but does anything and everything you want it to do. It even has one of the fastest (if not the fastest) processors onboard. My only issue is that it does get a little hot if you're using it for an extended amount of time to do anything too extreme. Wonderful phone though, I made sure to order plenty of tempered glass protectors for the front and back to ensure that I keep this little gem safe. Would highly recommend."
"397163","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact E5823 2GB/32GB 23MP 4.6-inch 4G LTE Factory Unlocked (BLACK) - International Stock No Warranty",5,"Phone arrived in 2 days. I am a US customer looking to use the unit with ATT. I received it on Tuesday, and end of day Thursday today, the phone is fully setup customized and functional, but for the carrier. I had some lingering items to wrap up on my old phone, and today I'll be getting ATT service connected. My goal was to keep a smaller phone (~4.5"") like my previous unit to preserve the 1 handed capability, and convenient pocket fit. I don't want a tablet for a phone, and have struggled to find a good modern model match for my needs. The Z5C looked to be a great match, and so far, it's a perfect fit for me.Package appeared to have been opened, however carefully, and then re-sealed. I suspect the reason it was opened was the addition of a US plug adapter for the EU style plug the unit comes with, as it does not look like a Sony converter. Where the phone uses a pretty standard 5V, 1500mA mUSB charger, of which I have a bunch, this wasn't a big deal. All other packages in the box (headphones, USB cable, extra earbud cushions, documents) were all intact and looked brand new, untouched. Phone itself still had original sticky film and packaging, and was in perfect new condition.Phone turned right on, and was ~60% charged. I was prompted quickly to change the language (second or third screen) as I ran setup from German to English I organized the OS as I prefer my phone laid out and set up and connected to wifi. The phone immediately ran two major system updates in parallel, and then after a restart, ran another. I'm now on Android 5.1.1, and admittedly, I'm not sure what it shipped with before the updates as they happened so fast.I love the square edges, which allow for some grip in a smartphone world where everything is slick and like holding onto a watersock if you don't have a cover on it. The phone looks like a sleek, black slab of sexy tech. Seriously, what a cool looking, striking design. The photos don't do it justice. I did buy a low profile cover for drop protection, and have used it intermittently. Compared to the IPhone 6 or the new Galaxy Edge, this is much easier to hold one handed without worrying about it squirting onto the pavement. That said, it's still a pretty slick and smooth piece of hardware in general, and I'd suggest a cover/protection.The phone is a great unit, and a perfect fit for my needs. I love the frosted glass back, the large screen/body ratio, and the charcoal colored polycarb frame.. I know some people take stars away for not liking the case/finish (non metal), but I find that odd. If you don't like it, why'd you drop $500 on it? It's a first class material, so the rest is just opinion. It actually has a pretty metallic look anyways. No one's going to look at this and say ""man, what a cheap looking phone. I promise. Phone does get a bit warm (which I really only experienced during the initial startup/setup), but there's a lot of horsepower in there, and that's to be expected. Nothing that bothered me.The fingerprint tech is awesome, and responds quickly and flawlessly. I have a few different fingers stored so that it's a comfortable unlock both righty and lefty. The hardware is clearly sufficient, as I've had a dozen things going on at once including downloading, a bluetooth beam, installing and updating apps, surfing a few internet tabs and writing a note all at once, and Android ran smooth, slick, quick and didn't break a sweat. Phone a very *solid* feel, very high quality, and certainly a first class phone that can be discussed in the circles of the current high end smartphone competition.Two minor drawbacks that I didn't think were worth removing a star for:1) No wireless charging. If the unit didn't have the rapid charge capability, this may have been a -1, but it charges so damned fast, and keeps charge so long, I couldn't do it. Still would be cool to drop it on those powermats at starbucks. Oh well.2) Volume buttons are too low on the thumb side (righty.) These should have been up top. I'm guessing there was a hardware conflict, but either way, it's a nitpick worth mentioning.Setup with personal and work emails was seamless, and calendar, emails and contacts all downloaded via wifi quickly and easily.I'm headed to ATT to finalize my new account and get the carrier service completed. Unless you see a follow up note from me, assume it also went smoothly."

"397170","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact E5823 2GB/32GB 23MP 4.6-inch 4G LTE Factory Unlocked (BLACK) - International Stock No Warranty",4,"First, I want to warn you that I have always loved Sony phones since it was Sony Ericsson. I still remember one of my older phones was a Sony Ericsson K550 that had a 2MP camera but produced pictures with the highest quality. After a disappointment with a Sony Ericsson C901 I decided to switch to Nokia from 2009 until 2013 when I bought a Sony Xperia GO that worked perfectly for 27 months until this November.I decided to buy a Sony Xperia Z5 Compact and after one week I think I can share my experience with all of you.This is a good phone. I know some people would never even consider getting a Sony phone but even they admit Sony is just quality. This phone has an excellent hardware and the way it integrated with the software (Lollipop working perfectly) is what I would call excellence. Connectivity is good since I can connect to 4G (LTE) without any trouble but you need to make sure this phone supports your carrier’s LTE band.Call quality (Let’s remember we still make phone calls with smartphones) is good and I have not had any issues with reception at all. The phone is thick but not as extremely thick as some people have complained. It’s noticeable in your pocket but nothing gross. It’s not heavy or uncomfortable. I have to mention at this point that inserting the SIM card and the memory card is not easy. I swear I’ll never open those slots again. I inserted a 64GB memory card and it’s working flawlessly.The screen delivers beautiful colors and the resolution is excellent. I know some people have complained it could have been better but still is very good. One of the main reasons I love Sony Xperias is because they usually have anti-scratch protection and I witnessed it with my previous Sony Xperia Go as it never got a single scratch in 27 months. The camera has been controversial in some reviews. Look, I know we should believe that smartphones will replace digital cameras but guess what? I don’t think so. The camera takes very good pictures and delivers excellent videos but it’s true it is not perfect. However, the camera is good for most occasions.Sound quality is excellent. I used PowerAMP for my music and this phone has a special feature to improve the overall sound quality with headsets (DSEE HX). It works perfectly and I haven’t had to arrange and tweak the PowerAMP equalizer all over as I did with my previous Sony Xperia GO.Battery life is good but not as other smartphones. If you listen to a lot of music (like me) you’ll need to charge the phone every single day. This is not a problem for me but I know some people might not like it. However, I have to mention that one day I almost didn’t use it and it just discharged from 99% at 7AM to 90% at 7PM so it really depends on usage. Another advantage is that it charges very quickly.The phone is very responsive and I have not experienced any bugs or lags as someone reported before. The camera works pretty well when I click on it taking just one second for the app to open.At this point you must be asking why I’m giving it only 4 stars and I am going to tell you why: heat.Unfortunately, the phone does get warm when you update apps or run another “intensive” process. It’s not all the time so I think Sony has done something maybe not to fix the problem they had before but at least to alleviate it. I want to clarify it gets warm – nothing extreme but still noticeable.This is an excellent phone, really. It’s quality and performance all in one but the heating issue should have been fixed by Sony at this point."

The phone also did not work perfectly after popping in the sim card. I used the phone on AT&T and to activate data on AT&T I had to setup the APN. The instructions are available on AT&T's website.The fingerprint sensor is a good feature; However, I also using an iOS base iPhone 6, and I find too few apps on android fully utilization the feature and I find myself falling back to my iOS device its integration into the apps.Dedicated camera feature is amazing and the new layout of the micro usb is excellent. It feels much more well built than the z3 compact. Speeds are good w/few hiccups."

They are great size, and fast performance. I don't know why people rave about camera. The quality of the camera is pretty nice, but the software that Sony runs is really slow. Sure, the camera is great, but it takes forever for the camera app to load and and focus on shots. The speed of the phone I love. The weight of the phone is more on the heavier side. I wish it was lighter and also thinner. The phone is a little thick and the volume rocker is in an awkward position. I like the dedicated camera button and I love the features the phone comes with inside its settings. I don't enjoy the placement of the front camera and it also takes some crappy photos as compared with photos taken from the front camera on the iPhone. I wish the apps were faster at loading and taking action."

I'm glad that I stumble upon this Sony Xperia z5 compact. It actually can last me over a full day of usage before I have to charge it. I love the small form factor with all the high end components. I'll stay with this Sony line for a while."
"397179","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact E5823 2GB/32GB 23MP 4.6-inch 4G LTE Factory Unlocked (BLACK) - International Stock No Warranty",3," There is a lot to like about the phone but there are a variety of issues too:1. Most importantly: this phone has a problem with touchscreen sensitivity in the lower part of the screen when the phone is not held in hand. It is particularly bad on some surfaces such as on a bed. Also the problem gets much worse if you install a glass protective screen. It starts being very noticeable on almost all surfaces.I've made a quick demonstration video about the issue (see below). Other users have reported this issue with their phone https://talk.sonymobile.com/t5/Xperia-Z5-Z5-Compact-Z5-Premium/z5-compact-touchscreen-acting-weird/m-p/1079627/highlight/false#M6713Therefore it is a design defect by Sony. Surprisingly it appears to affect only the white version of the phone.2. It does heat up quite a lot during normal use (like updating apps) or watching videos. And the battery is drained faster than on previous version that I have (Z1 Compact)3. I didn't see any improvement in photo quality compared to the old Z1 (in fact some pics look worse in identical settings). At the same time there is a substantial improvement in focusing and in video quality."
"397180","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact E5823 2GB/32GB 23MP 4.6-inch 4G LTE Factory Unlocked (BLACK) - International Stock No Warranty",4,"I have had this phone for 2 weeks now, and I still have things to evaluate, but so far these are my observations when compared to the features of my prior Galaxy S4 miniFirst pros. this is truly an amazing phone with so many features well beyond my previous Samsung S4 mini. The screen is great, and let's you choose enhancements to it that make pictures and videos really stand out. A 23 MP camera, take very good (albeit large sized) pictures; I have yet to try it in darker situations, where apparently it has been challenged in other reviews. It runs smoothly even when multiple apps are open, and its a breeze to switch between apps. The finger scanner works neatly, although the location will only allow you to use it with your right hand; you can also set up multiple users or guests to the phone, with their own apps, settings and finger scans (kind of like a computer profile), which is great for kids not messing up your settings. It has a ton of customizable phone features for screen, power management sounds, app management, that I was no where close to have with the smaller Galaxy -you can program what the phone will do when you plug it to the charger, when it connects with your car's bluetooh, or when you plug in head phones, so different apps can activate automatically. I do not own a PS3, but apparently you can hook it up somehow to PS3 controllers and play games through it (sounds like a cool feature); it also offers you a lot of connectivity options to external devices like Chromecast. Something I really liked was the corrector/dictionary, actually allows me to type in two different languages and word suggestions come in both without specifying or switching between languages,while keeping your keyboard in the desired setting. Aesthetically the phone looks nice, with a smooth finish front and back; the side material does look on the cheap side though, it would have been nice to have metal on the side instead, but that may hamper the waterproofing capabilities (it says waterproof, but I have n o intention of testing that on a phone w/o warranty). The back is also made of a glassy finish, which does make it a bit slippery in your hands. Finally, the size of the phone (the main thing that drove me to it) is great for its category; Sony really put a lot of features into a small package, making it feel like a flagship rather than a 2nd tier mini version you find of other smaller phones.So for the cons: Its not really the phones fault, but this is a european phone on american network, which means its not fully compatible (at least with Tmobile). It lacks the 3G 1700 band, all other bands apparently are the same as Tmobile network. This has the phone constantly switching between 3G and HSDPA and will drain the battery out in a day or less. I tried the phone for a week in Florida (Ft Lauderdale area) and in Texas (Houston area) and it is about the same, in spite of being large metropolitan areas. I cant tell exactly if HSDPA is equivalent to 4G or 4G LTE connectivity speedwise, so when it is on that it seemed fast-ish. When I mean constant switching I mean sometimes you would actually have to move the phone around so it would get the signal right and download things. This, added to the low battery life, is somewhat annoying which is sad, because the phone does have these apparently great customizable battery saving features that tell you you should have the phone for more than a day without charge, of course it does not count on the phone switching between networks so frequently and battery barely lasts a day with moderate use.Maybe the phone works better on other carriers, it is truly unfortunate that Tmobile/Sony have not agreed to provide this phone on the US market, it is really an awesome phone by itself. If someone knows how to do away with the network issues, or of a carrier where it will work well, let me know"

"397185","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact E5823 2GB/32GB 23MP 4.6-inch 4G LTE Factory Unlocked (BLACK) - International Stock No Warranty",1,"**SEE UPDATE BELOW**I've been using this phone for over 3 weeks now and I so glad I went with the Z5C.HARDWAREIt heats up a bit when doing heavy gaming or long video recordings, but not all too concerning...especially considering I don't notice any heat during typical daily operation. I would say the battery is adequate but it wouldn't be considered one of the strengths of this phone. I don't imagine battery life gets any better with other phones unless you go bigger...which, why the hell would you be looking at this phone if you were willing to do that? Go with the Xperia Z5. That said, I haven't experimented too much with ""stamina mode"" but if you use alternate messaging services / apps (like Google Voice) or music streaming apps, you'll have to add those apps as exceptions to be able to use data when the screen is off...which will diminish the benefit of ""stamina mode"" and preclude you from using ""ultra stamina mode"" all together. This is my first Quick Charge 2.0 device and I'm very impressed with how much charge you can get out of having it plugged in a just a while (ie 10 minutes). Wireless charging would've been nice to have but I'll gladly sacrifice that feature to get dual front facing speakers, expandable memory, and water resistance.Speaking of expandable memory. My buddy was playing with a camera-equipped drone his girlfriend got him for Christmas and was bummed he couldn't get the videos off the micro SD card (he didn't have an adapter). Everyone at the party (iPhone users) was blown away at how I was able to get and share the video by putting the micro SD card in my phone and using Google Drive to share it. I don't know why we are letting phone manufacturers sucker us by buying phones without expandable memory.At 720p screen resolution / quality looks great to me. If reading small text is difficult or annoying or you plan on watching HD full-length movies on your phone, get a bigger phone. I have excellent eyesight and find this display great for watching YouTube videos or reading articles.I don't take a lot of photos / videos but I'm pleased with the camera so far. You can find great camera comparisons online. From what I found this camera is great but Samsungs perform better in low-light and close up focusing...but the Z5C is a huge step up from my HTC One M7 when it comes to low light pictures.SOFTWAREI was a big fan of HTC's Sense UI and didn't know how I'd like Sony's UI as this is my first smartphone from them. After downloading an HTC-like free clock / weather widget, I like the UI a lot. Screenshots and screen capture are particularly easy and fun. Still waiting for Android 6.0 Marshmallow update that was promised (see summary below).SUMMARYAs far as I know the perfect phone doesn't exist but based on the other flagship phones available right now and my preference for water-resistance, expandable memory, and front facing speakers...I was prepared to give this phone a perfect 5 stars. I'm giving it 4 however because it would appear that Sony is following the lead of others by promising ""soon"" updates to the latest android version (6.0 Marshmallow) to help sell their new flagship phone but then making those of us who believed them and bought the phone wait around while the update is delayed. If the update comes prior to the new year I'll adjust my review to 5 stars. Almost 3 months for an update seems like enough time to tailor Marshmallow to their UI...if it was a priority.**UPDATE**This is the worst phone I've ever had. On paper it's great but I've never been so frustrated with lagging issue. I'll get a phone call while its in my hand and I'll mis the call because pushing ""answer"" is non-responsive. Killing apps helps a bit but I find myself restarting the phone a lot. I was hoping the Marshmellow update would help but its now March 8th & still no update. First & last time I buy a Sony phone. Since the Galaxy S7 is water resistant with expandable memory, I think I'll get it if a softwarw update comes soon & fixes my problems."

Fingerprint sensor works great and is super convenient. Battery life lasts a full day but I don't see it going past a full day on normal usage (I'm typically on wifi and 4G).

Doesn't feel cheap or plasticky at all.• Screen is nice and bright. Call quality is excellent.• Easy to navigate screen interface one handed. Holding it correctly, with your pinkie under the bottom to support the phone, there should be no issue using one handed. Your thumb should be able to reach all spots on the display. As far as I know, this is the only newly released premium handset in this size/form factorThe bad:• Like the Z3C, the back is glass, although frosted this time so the grip is slightly better. Premium feel, but very fragile.• Despite the faster CPU, the interface is slower and not as instant as the Z3C when opening apps.• Battery life is not as good as the Z3C, but still better than any other premium smart phone out there. I was charging every other day with the Z3C, but must charge at the end of the day with the Z5C. This is with moderate use.• The camera is just above average. With Sony optics you would think it would be better than it is.• When taking a photo, the camera is slow to open, and even slower to preview a picture just taken. Can be an issue when trying to catch a moment at just the right time.• For T-mobile, although the hardware supports band 12, T-mobile's 700MHz spectrum, it is not enabled. So you may find spotty reception in areas where you had excellent reception in the past with a T-mobile phone purchased from the carrier.

This version came with a micro USB cable, power brick, headphones, and some manuals( mostly were not in English). The phone will have android version 5.1.1 (lollipop) straight out of the package with a few pre-installed software that you can delete. After just receiving this phone I noticed that the design was different, and the original fingerprint magnet glass on the rear of the phone from the z3c is replaced by frosted glass. So No more finger prints. Also the phone is slightly more thicker than the z3c and the edges are more round with a matte feel to it. There is only one flap on the left side to insert a memory card or micro SD card on the side. The volume keys are now under the power button which needs getting used to for me. The phone can be charged from the bottom using a micro USB cable which is included. You no longer have to open a flap to charge the phone which doesn't change the fact that the phone is still water proof/resistant. The power button is now longer providing a finger print sensor which works flawlessly so far. I haven't got much time into the user interface but have noticed that the display is very dim compared to the z3c if the adaptive brightness setting is on. So far it feels responsive, no lag, a few tweaks in the UI, and 4G LTE works fine for me. The camera is now 23 MP with fast auto focus, and the front facing camera is 5 MP. Overall great phone, but design could have been better and display is still 720p.UPDATE: Dropped phone on concrete from just above 3ft (with no case), and slightly dented the phone's edge. Screen survived any cracks or damage and phone still works fine."
"397206","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact E5823 2GB/32GB 23MP 4.6-inch 4G LTE Factory Unlocked (BLACK) - International Stock No Warranty",5,"Looking for a small sized phone that packs a lot of power? Then this is for you. I may be in a minority but I just don't see the need for phones to be the size that they are right now. I wanted something small enough to operate with one hand and to easily fit in my pocket.My previous phone was an original Moto X and that was a great size for me so I wanted something similar, but all of the OEMs were only producing these massive devices that require two hands to operate. I mean really, how am I supposed to text and drive if I have to take both hands off the wheel? (That's a joke, NEVER text and drive.)So I did tons of research, using the phone comparison feature on sites like gsmarena.com to check the physical dimensions. The other problem was that when I did find a ""small"" phone, it usually had terrible specs. A dumbed down processor from 2 generations ago, not much memory, and often a mediocre camera.Then I found the Sony Xperia Z5 compact. This phone is small but it doesn't skimp on performance. It actually has the same processor as Google's flagship Nexus 6P, so it's blazing fast. Comes with 2GB ram (the 6P has 3GB though I believe) and 32GB built in storage which is easily expanded with an microSD card. Camera is top notch too, being from Sony who has been making cameras and camera lenses for a long time. The other nice thing is the battery life, since it has a good sized battery paired with a smaller screen, the screen actually drains the battery less than on the bigger devices. When I first bought it, I was easily getting 2 days of battery life but now that is more like a day or day and a half depending on my usage.I actually ordered it here unlocked because nobody else is carrying it in the US. When mine arrived, the menus were all in Chinese, but a quick YouTube search showed me how to switch them back to English and I was all set.I'm a big Android fan so I was weary of what kind of bloatware Sony might have installed on this. But it's really not bad at all and feels very similar to a pure android experience. There are a few little things that are different and you can uninstall any of the Sony pre-installed apps without any issue. Mine was also recently OTA'd to Marshmallow which seemed to improve performance quite a bit.Overall, I'm so happy I bought this phone. It's the perfect size if you're looking for a small Android device and has enough processing power to keep up with the latest devices. Oh, the built in fingerprint scanner in the power button is super nice too, as is the physical camera shutter button. Both of these are features I use daily. (Note: I heard that the US spec phones won't have the fingerprint scanner, so be sure to check if that matters to you.)"

I am using the At&t nano sim through straight talk and everything is working just fine.The only downside so far is the camera loads fairly slow.

I've only owned Nexi before this, but I find Sony's customizations are almost all additive, like glove mode or being able to reboot or screenshot with a click of the power button. Any uninstallable apps you don't like, just disable in Settings.I use mine without a case and with a lanyard (not included, but I bought some silver ones on Amazon for about $5), which adds no bulk, keeps the phone pure but like a case, offers (preventative) protection against drops. Some have complained about the ""lip"" of the outer frame, but I don't find it remotely bothersome in hand and it protects the glass. It's functional - something any great design must be, not just beautiful. I laugh at all the iPhones wearing ugly cases.I have noticed a couple of intermittent software bugs here & there (example: blacks sometimes look gray when waking from sleep and auto-adjust brightness is on) but nothing I can't live with, and Sony has OTA-air shipped both a firmware and a camera update in the month I've owned the phone.Battery life is great, solidly over a day with moderatly heavy screen-on time use and up to two days with Stamina mode enabled.Just buy it.

The main features I was looking for in a new phone were small size and battery life and I don' think it gets any better than the Z5 compact. My previous phone was a Droid Mini because it was the smallest Android phone available on Verizon. I was hesitant to switch from Verizon because I had been with them for a decade, but I have had no problems so far on AT&T and the Z5 Compact performs great and feels great (much better than the plasticky Droid Mini). In terms of battery life I would take the Mini off of the charger at 7am and with light-average usage it would be dead by 4pm. The same routine with the Z5 Compact always shows more than 65% battery remaining at 4pm."

There is no other way to put it. It's hands-down the most premium feeling phone I've held - and that's with it swinging against the big guns such as the S6 Edge, HTC One, and iPhone 6.Cons:-I'm not a huge fan of the frosted back, and think it would have looked better with a normal glass back or just a continuation of the excellent plastic used for the sides. This is largely personal preference though.-The volume rocker is in an extremely awkward position. Unlike the Z3 Compact, you really have to work to use it. Would have been better located above the power button.-It comes in Japanese, and it's very difficult to find the language setting. Pull down the notification bar, then again for settings, click the gear, scroll down to the keyboard, then the top setting.Pros:-The fingerprint sensor/power button is fantastic. It's placed perfectly, works fast, and has just the right feel.-Impeccable fit and finish.-Near stock android.-Design.-Specs.-Camera button, which is sadly a dying feature.

This phone is exactly what the iPhone users are hanging onto, a sub 5 inch phone with competitive specs. The 720p resolution is totally fine for the size of the screen. If you feel like it is a big sacrifice, just remember it improves the battery life (up to 2 days). The camera is pretty amazing and the expandable memory (micro sd) is also a breath of fresh air coming from an iPhone.

At first I was kind of iffy going from a 1080 to a 720 display resolution but honestly you can barely tell a difference. You would really have to pay close attention to the screen to point out the difference. I am glad I wen with the Z5C, it is a premium phone in a compact size.

The phone is fast, has enough storage for most people and also that storage can be expanded by up to 100Gb via SD card. After reading the write-ups, I decided that this was the right one. I then had to decide which model, US or International and which vendor. I chose the international model, E5823 because it was a tad lower price but more importantly has the fingerprint reader (left off of the E5803, US model). There were two other criteria - would Sony honor the warranty in the US? Answer from Sony, yes. It may take a couple more days to process, but no warranty issue. Their service center is in Laredo Texas. Also, I wanted to know where I might have to return the phone if it arrived DOA (it didn't). Some vendors require shipping back to Europe or Hong Kong at a cost of $50-$60. No way on that. I chose to buy from CANGURO through Amazon. They are in Chicago and back the product from there. They answered all of my questions. EXCELLENT seller! There is one issue with the phone and it's a software issue. It was not enough for me to downgrade the rating, but might be an issue for you.

I had been considering making the jump for some time, but I had yet to find an Android phone that matched the build quality and performance of my iPhone 6S. The z5 Compact finally did convinced me.Pros:+ Same size screen as the iPhone 6S, despite being smaller and lighter.+ Excellent build quality - the phone feels premium, solid and well made. I don't worry about anything breaking if I drop it once or twice.+ Waterproof!+ Very little manufacturer bloatware, especially compared to Samsung or LG. Among other things, this means that future Android updates will hit this phone sooner than many other Android devices.+ I actually most of the bloatware that's included. Sony's launcher is fast and responsive - I'm actually using it instead of the official Google launcher.+ Camera is high quality.+ Better battery life than my iPhone 6s+ Fingerprint scanner+ Plenty of processing power - I haven't yet seen the phone slow down or choke on any app I've thrown at it.Cons:- Cases options for this phone in the U.S. are limited when compared to the dancing plethora of iPhone cases that flood every electronics store, website, gas station and grocery store.- Because this is the international version of the phone, there's no warranty- Because this is the international version of the phone, some apps think I'm in Ireland. I'm sure a simple setting could easily change this, but I haven't yet found it.- Fingerprint scanner doesn't work as well as iPhone 6S (though it's still good). I think this is mainly due to the fact that the scanner is smaller than the iPhone scanner, so it has less to work with.Overall, I've found this phone to be the perfect fit for me. It really hits the sweet spot of combining the power, battery life, screen size and non-bloated OS that I've been looking for."

"397256","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact E5823 2GB/32GB 23MP 4.6-inch 4G LTE Factory Unlocked (BLACK) - International Stock No Warranty",4,"EDIT (1/9/16): My original evaluation of this phone remains the same but I would encourage people to look at the HTC One A9 as it addresses the US compatability aspect while still being pocketable. It is not as compact as the Z5c, meaning Sony is still the only name in the game but the A9 is still manageable. You can read my review here: https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B017D554UKI have been through every phone you can imagine and the Sony Xperia Compact line continues to impress me. I recently had a Nexus 6p and Nexus 5x and the sizes are just to much for me. Yes, I really want Marshmallow but can wait an extra few weeks for it. I asked a few questions before buying and had trouble getting clear information due to the technical nature, but wanted to clarify for those who are looking.This phone is almost fully compatible with T-Mobile USA and I can confirm Band 12 (Extended Range LTE) *does* work (confirmed with LTE Discovery). However, there is no HD Voice, VoLTE or WiFi Calling. For me, these trade-offs were well worth it because of the phenomenal battery life (which will likely get better on Marshmallow), the compact form factor and water resistance (just nice to have as a backup). If WiFi calling is an issue for you, you can use something like Hangouts phone calls as a backup. It is of course not as convenient, but it works. HD Voice is only compatible T-Mobile <> T-Mobile and, yes, you can tell the difference and I wish I had it - but again, not a huge trade-off. VoLTE is the one that gets me. For those of you that don't know, this means the phone drops your data down to 3G/HSPA when making a phone call. Not the end of the world but you may notice the difference when navigating, tethering to your PC, trying to navigate, etc. Again, you could get around this by using a third-party dialer (Hangouts) since that is a VoIP call but for most people, this may be overkill. I suspect though most people buying this phone are pretty familiar with these things since the phone is not advertised in the US. The lack of VoLTE/WiFi Calling/HD Voice is the only reason I knocked off a star.Note the phone comes with an international charger and adapter. It is compatible with QuickCharge technology and charges rapidly for example with this Swiftrans 3221263 Quick Charge 2.0 36W Dual Ports USB Car ChargerThe camera on the phone is pretty good - not the best - but will be fine for 9/10 people.I am using the phone with Aomax® For Sony Xperia Z5 Compact / Mini Tempered Glass Screen Protector [Superslim 0.26mm,2.5D Round Edge,9H Hardness] [Retail Package] For(Sony Xperia Z5 Compact / Mini) and Orzly® - FlexiSlim Case for SONY XPERIA Z5 COMPACT (2015 SmartPhone Model / Smallest Version / XPERIA Z5 MINI) - Super Slim (0.35mm) Protective Phone Cover in Semi Transparent WHITE. It was important to me I protected the device but didn't go overboard on the bulkiness - the combination of these two are perfect. I have reviewed each of these independently but included one picture here of the phone, glass and case together.Overall this is an awesome phone for people who aren't concerned about buying direct from a carrier and don't want a huge phone."

If you are in the US be prepared to run into small workable issues. I use AT&T and the company was great in supporting the unlocked phone, setting me up with a visit to the distribution office for the Nano-sim install and activation. The issues I am talking about is the distribution centers have no experience with this phone and had no idea how to move the data from my old Samsung Rugby (smart phone version) to the new phone, how to install the Nano Sim or the SD card. Since AT&T will not allow two phones to be active at the same time I could not download the Xperia App to the old phone --- you must do this prior to deactivating the old sim --- via Google play, a similar app is needed for Bluetooth transfer --- the only option to find and buy the Xperia data cable and try that. For those reading this and are thinking that all I have to do is to remove the SD card from the old Samsung Rugby which is also an Android device with all the latest updates. It doesn’t work, the Xperia Z5 compact rejected the phone contacts as not being in the right format. What the heck? The Samsung Rugby (smart phone version) does not use the *.vcf format and will not transfer to the Xperia.Even if I have to transfer all my contacts to my new Xperia Z5 Compact manually I’m willing to do so. This phone supports amazingly clear conversations using Bluetooth headset, speaker-phone, or near the face, the camera is outstanding. Even though there are complaints of the 780 display I don’t see it. I am very happy with a phone that is not tethered to a charging dock every few hours. I have to ask, if wireless means you are not connected to an RJ jack but are tethered to a charger all the time what is the difference? Bonus, with the reasonable screen size I do not have to hire a porter and baggage cart to haul it around, it fits into my pocket, imagine that!"

"397261","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact E5823 2GB/32GB 23MP 4.6-inch 4G LTE Factory Unlocked (BLACK) - International Stock No Warranty",3,"TL;DR PRO/CON list at bottom.I will start off this review by saying that I really wanted to love this phone. It does have some very good qualities about it. But the phone has its faults, which are enough for me to not give this phone a recommendation. I have used the phone for approximately 6 months.By background is that I worked in the cell phone industry selling phones for years, before moving into corporate IT and networking. I have been a amateur phone enthusiast and have easily had over 30 phones in my day. I also take exceptional care of my belongings, electronics getting special care. Seeing as this phone is a bit expensive for the size, it was a bit of a treat for myself as the specs and design looked like everything I wanted.HardwareScreen is a nice size for one handed use. Is very crisp and easy to see inside and outside in bright sunlight. Physical buttons are a tad awkward being so low on the device, but worked well for how I hold a phone. They provide enough click, but are a little hard to ""feel out"" and press during a call. Volume on the dual speakers is adequate for a small phone and produce decent sound. Sound through earphones is very good. 2 GB of RAM is more than enough to power the 720p screen and the 810 processor never lets up. The fingerprint scanner is top notch. Works very fast and recognizes fingers well. It allows 5 fingers to be registered. I did my wife's thumb, left index, right index, and my right thumb twice for better accuracy on my main digit. Sometimes I would pull the phone out of my pocket and it would already have registered my thumb and unlocked itself.UI, Performance, and Battery LifeThis phone came with Android Lollipop and is now updated to Marshmallow. The UI runs well. The fast processor and 2 GB of RAM don't let this phone slow down much if at all. Sony's take on Android is a very clean and minimal. Although there is plenty of Sony ""bloatware"" apps that come preinstalled and cannot be removed. You can ""disable"" them so they are no longer active and don't appear in the menu, but still live on the device. The Snapdragon 810 does still tend to get hot at random times. An app may be running in the background and you can feel the phone get much warmer. Never hot that you feel in danger, but warm enough to warranty a reboot in my opinion. Once back up the device was cool again. Battery life on the phone is decent, but not close to the expectation that Sony has set with previous devices in the series. It will get you through a day easily with moderate to heavy use, and can easily stretch to two days with light use. Recharge time however is very long. If you plug into a PC to charge expect at least 3 - 4 hours to charge it up. A quick charge adapter is a wise investment if you get this phone.Apps and GamingI largely got this phone for remote play on the PS4; that feature worked wonderfully with no issues. While the small screen was a little hard to see at times, I never had an issue with pairing the PS4 controller via bluetooth or playing over WiFi. The stock messaging app always gave me trouble with MMS messages, even with the correct settings from AT&T. I constantly got a you have an MMS to download message even though I already read the message. Textra fixed that issue and is a much better messaging app in my opinion. I don't really play any other types of mobile games, but companion apps for Destiny, Metal Gear Solid V, and standard apps like The Weather Channel all ran great on the device. As mentioned before there is A LOT of Sony branded items that are just flat out annoying and not needed.CameraWonderful camera. Loved to take pictures with this phone. They almost always come out clear and sharp. With the latest updates the camera opens quickly. The phone does a good job of fast auto-focus as promised. The shutter key on the side of the device is great for open the camera quickly and nice to take a picture. Finger placement while holding the phone is a bit awkward as the camera is very close the the top edge of the phone and gets covered easy if you are not careful. I spent most of my time in superior auto mode which produces 8 mp images. Going into manual will give you an overwhelming amount of options and allow full 23 mp pictures.DesignLooking at the phone it screams premium. Add waterproofing to the device and that is just piece of mind that some rain or accidental spills will not harm the device. No flap for the charge port is also wonderful as I've seen my share of them get damaged on phone such as the Galaxy S5 which kills the waterproofing of the device. The phone has a heafty weight to it that also feels good. The frosted glass back looks very nice and does not attract fingerprints. The phone is very slippery. On a scale of 1 to 10 with 1 being course grit sand paper and 10 being metal coated in Teflon covered in olive oil, this phone is a 9 easy. The phone literally wants to slide out of your hand whenever you hold it. If nothing else a case is needed to provide some grip to the phone. Having a glass front and back also made me extra cautious and nervous about potential cracks. But I have always taken care of my devices and never cracked a screen.Phone callsPhone calls on the device were clean on my end every time. There were issues for the other caller especially when I used speaker phone. Callers would often complain that they heard themselves or that they could not hear me until I went back to the earpiece. It also appeared that using the speaker phone only used the bottom speaker and not both.DurabilityThis phone is by its very nature fragile. With over 90% of the outer casing being glass, you better believe this baby is delicate. The phone came with a pre-installed screen protector, but it became cruddy very fast. I normally don't use a screen protector and have never had an issue. I somehow managed to put a small scratch on the screen while it was in my pocket with NOTHING else in it one day while hiking. It was no big deal, as I couldn't see it when the screen was on, but I knew it was there and worried me that it got damaged so easily. Now just recently a friend placed my phone near a counter edge, and a got a few messages in a row that made the device vibrate right off the edge. Of course it landed face down on kitchen tile. Screen completely shattered and the touch screen stopped functioning altogether. I am not knocking this phone because of my stupid mistake, not many phones if any would survive a fall like that. Instead it just goes to show that a rugged case is just about required for this device. Which is a huge bummer since the phone looks so good.TL;DR and PROS/CONS ListPROS-- Nice screen for a smaller phone-- Beautiful design-- Great camera-- Fast performance-- Sony's UI has a good design-- Waterproof-- Native PS4 remote playCons-- Sony bloatware that cannot be removed, just disabled-- Slippery-- Fragile-- Poor speaker phone quality for the other caller-- Awkward button placement-- Very slow charge time-- Expensive-- Sony is slow to update UIConclusion and thoughtsThe phone is not worth the price. The camera is very nice and waterproofing is a big plus, but a few nice features do not outweigh the fact you are terrified to accidentally drop such an expensive phone. If you don't let anyone else touch this phone, and put it in a really hard-core case, it may last you a good while. If you live in the real world where you may leave you phone on a desk, give it to someone to take a picture of you, or bump into something with the phone in your pocket it may be dropped and will break."

Then this is for you. I may be in a minority but I just don't see the need for phones to be the size that they are right now. I wanted something small enough to operate with one hand and to easily fit in my pocket.My previous phone was an original Moto X and that was a great size for me so I wanted something similar, but all of the OEMs were only producing these massive devices that require two hands to operate. I mean really, how am I supposed to text and drive if I have to take both hands off the wheel? (That's a joke, NEVER text and drive.)So I did tons of research, using the phone comparison feature on sites like gsmarena.com to check the physical dimensions. The other problem was that when I did find a ""small"" phone, it usually had terrible specs. A dumbed down processor from 2 generations ago, not much memory, and often a mediocre camera.Then I found the Sony Xperia Z5 compact. This phone is small but it doesn't skimp on performance. It actually has the same processor as Google's flagship Nexus 6P, so it's blazing fast. Comes with 2GB ram (the 6P has 3GB though I believe) and 32GB built in storage which is easily expanded with an microSD card. Camera is top notch too, being from Sony who has been making cameras and camera lenses for a long time. The other nice thing is the battery life, since it has a good sized battery paired with a smaller screen, the screen actually drains the battery less than on the bigger devices. When I first bought it, I was easily getting 2 days of battery life but now that is more like a day or day and a half depending on my usage.I actually ordered it here unlocked because nobody else is carrying it in the US. When mine arrived, the menus were all in Chinese, but a quick YouTube search showed me how to switch them back to English and I was all set.I'm a big Android fan so I was weary of what kind of bloatware Sony might have installed on this. But it's really not bad at all and feels very similar to a pure android experience. There are a few little things that are different and you can uninstall any of the Sony pre-installed apps without any issue. Mine was also recently OTA'd to Marshmallow which seemed to improve performance quite a bit.Overall, I'm so happy I bought this phone. It's the perfect size if you're looking for a small Android device and has enough processing power to keep up with the latest devices. Oh, the built in fingerprint scanner in the power button is super nice too, as is the physical camera shutter button. Both of these are features I use daily. (Note: I heard that the US spec phones won't have the fingerprint scanner, so be sure to check if that matters to you.)"

Compact size without sacrificing CPU and other features like most other ""mini"" phones. I am using this on AT&T in the USA.Pros:- Battery life is astounding. I usually go to bed with ~40% battery after a day of use.- Compact size - so awesome. Hate how big most phones are these days, this is the perfect size for me- Fast. ""Flagship"" phone specs but in a compact size.- Fingerprint scanner. Love this. I hate lock screens but I am required to use them for a few apps, and company policy. Fingerprint scanner works pretty well.- Smart lock - nice feature that is new to me. Auto-unlocks the phone based on certain conditions, such as if certain bluetooth devices are connected, by location (while at home for example) and/or other criteria. Makes having a lock screen much less of a pain.- Dedicated camera button, press and hold to power on the phone and open camera, nice for quick photos- Dual front-facing speakers. Very loud, sound is decent, a bit tinny, but that's expected from such a small device.- Great screen, very clear and bright, no complaints there- Did I mention it's tiny?Cons:- Camera is pretty mediocre. I'm not a big camera user but for some this may be a dealbreaker. My 4 year old HTC One M7 took far better pictures.- Now that I've had it several months, the fingerprint scanner is getting a little glitchy. Most of the time a reboot fixes the problem, but usually comes back after a couple days. Definitely annoying.- Case options are pretty limited, and many of them cover the power button therefore disabling the use of the fingerprint scanner.- 720p resolution. Honestly I don't consider this a downside at all, who wants to watch 1080p video on a 4"" screen anyway. But for some, resolution is important.- Personally I don't like the factory dialer. I almost always dial by number and this one pulls up a list of contacts by default and takes an extra tap to get the keypad. Slightly annoying, but easily fixed with 3rd-party dialers in the Play store.- Gorilla Glass. Hotly debated, but this phone doesn't have it. Sony uses their own proprietary tempered glass, supposedly just as scratch-resistant as Gorilla Glass. I've own the phone for 3 months now and have zero scratches, and survived a couple drops."

From the beginning the phone was a little slow to respond in many ways but I could deal with it. About 3 months ago the camera stopped working entirely. I called customer support and was told to do a soft reset, then hard reset. Neither of those worked.I asked about sending the phone in for repair and was informed that because this model came from Hong Kong, that they could not repair it, it is not covered under warranty, I would have to contact the Hong Kong customer service. I have been back and forth between both Hong Kong and US customer service, both of them just give me the run around and refuse to take responsibility for their faulty product, and will not repair it. After contacting the US customer service again, they advised me to do a software repair. I followed the steps and now my phone is entirely stuck on the beginning intro screen and will not function at all. In other words, right now I paid over $500.00 for a non functioning phone with Sony refusing to fix their faulty product.This phone is a giant lemon, and after dealing with Sonys customer service I will never purchase a Sony product again."

I've only owned Nexi before this, but I find Sony's customizations are almost all additive, like glove mode or being able to reboot or screenshot with a click of the power button. Any uninstallable apps you don't like, just disable in Settings.I use mine without a case and with a lanyard (not included, but I bought some silver ones on Amazon for about $5), which adds no bulk, keeps the phone pure but like a case, offers (preventative) protection against drops. Some have complained about the ""lip"" of the outer frame, but I don't find it remotely bothersome in hand and it protects the glass. It's functional - something any great design must be, not just beautiful. I laugh at all the iPhones wearing ugly cases.I have noticed a couple of intermittent software bugs here & there (example: blacks sometimes look gray when waking from sleep and auto-adjust brightness is on) but nothing I can't live with, and Sony has OTA-air shipped both a firmware and a camera update in the month I've owned the phone.Battery life is great, solidly over a day with moderatly heavy screen-on time use and up to two days with Stamina mode enabled.Just buy it.

I had originally wanted the Z3+ (Z4 elsewhere), but right when I was about to buy it, the Z5 Compact came out. While it's not available in the US via normal retailers, I was able to get a warranty for it via SquareTrade. So that made it a no brainer for me.

"397287","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact E5823 2GB/32GB 23MP 4.6-inch 4G LTE Factory Unlocked (CORAL RED) - International Stock No Warranty",4,"EDIT (1/9/16): My original evaluation of this phone remains the same but I would encourage people to look at the HTC One A9 as it addresses the US compatability aspect while still being pocketable. It is not as compact as the Z5c, meaning Sony is still the only name in the game but the A9 is still manageable. You can read my review here: https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B017D554UKI have been through every phone you can imagine and the Sony Xperia Compact line continues to impress me. I recently had a Nexus 6p and Nexus 5x and the sizes are just to much for me. Yes, I really want Marshmallow but can wait an extra few weeks for it. I asked a few questions before buying and had trouble getting clear information due to the technical nature, but wanted to clarify for those who are looking.This phone is almost fully compatible with T-Mobile USA and I can confirm Band 12 (Extended Range LTE) *does* work (confirmed with LTE Discovery). However, there is no HD Voice, VoLTE or WiFi Calling. For me, these trade-offs were well worth it because of the phenomenal battery life (which will likely get better on Marshmallow), the compact form factor and water resistance (just nice to have as a backup). If WiFi calling is an issue for you, you can use something like Hangouts phone calls as a backup. It is of course not as convenient, but it works. HD Voice is only compatible T-Mobile <> T-Mobile and, yes, you can tell the difference and I wish I had it - but again, not a huge trade-off. VoLTE is the one that gets me. For those of you that don't know, this means the phone drops your data down to 3G/HSPA when making a phone call. Not the end of the world but you may notice the difference when navigating, tethering to your PC, trying to navigate, etc. Again, you could get around this by using a third-party dialer (Hangouts) since that is a VoIP call but for most people, this may be overkill. I suspect though most people buying this phone are pretty familiar with these things since the phone is not advertised in the US. The lack of VoLTE/WiFi Calling/HD Voice is the only reason I knocked off a star.Note the phone comes with an international charger and adapter. It is compatible with QuickCharge technology and charges rapidly for example with this Swiftrans 3221263 Quick Charge 2.0 36W Dual Ports USB Car ChargerThe camera on the phone is pretty good - not the best - but will be fine for 9/10 people.I am using the phone with Aomax® For Sony Xperia Z5 Compact / Mini Tempered Glass Screen Protector [Superslim 0.26mm,2.5D Round Edge,9H Hardness] [Retail Package] For(Sony Xperia Z5 Compact / Mini) and Orzly® - FlexiSlim Case for SONY XPERIA Z5 COMPACT (2015 SmartPhone Model / Smallest Version / XPERIA Z5 MINI) - Super Slim (0.35mm) Protective Phone Cover in Semi Transparent WHITE. It was important to me I protected the device but didn't go overboard on the bulkiness - the combination of these two are perfect. I have reviewed each of these independently but included one picture here of the phone, glass and case together.Overall this is an awesome phone for people who aren't concerned about buying direct from a carrier and don't want a huge phone."

If you are in the US be prepared to run into small workable issues. I use AT&T and the company was great in supporting the unlocked phone, setting me up with a visit to the distribution office for the Nano-sim install and activation. The issues I am talking about is the distribution centers have no experience with this phone and had no idea how to move the data from my old Samsung Rugby (smart phone version) to the new phone, how to install the Nano Sim or the SD card. Since AT&T will not allow two phones to be active at the same time I could not download the Xperia App to the old phone --- you must do this prior to deactivating the old sim --- via Google play, a similar app is needed for Bluetooth transfer --- the only option to find and buy the Xperia data cable and try that. For those reading this and are thinking that all I have to do is to remove the SD card from the old Samsung Rugby which is also an Android device with all the latest updates. It doesn’t work, the Xperia Z5 compact rejected the phone contacts as not being in the right format. What the heck? The Samsung Rugby (smart phone version) does not use the *.vcf format and will not transfer to the Xperia.Even if I have to transfer all my contacts to my new Xperia Z5 Compact manually I’m willing to do so. This phone supports amazingly clear conversations using Bluetooth headset, speaker-phone, or near the face, the camera is outstanding. Even though there are complaints of the 780 display I don’t see it. I am very happy with a phone that is not tethered to a charging dock every few hours. I have to ask, if wireless means you are not connected to an RJ jack but are tethered to a charger all the time what is the difference? Bonus, with the reasonable screen size I do not have to hire a porter and baggage cart to haul it around, it fits into my pocket, imagine that!"

This phone is built really well, looks sharp and is the perfect size.The phone is speedy, all wireless connections are sturdy and I love Sony's Android Skin."
"397292","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact E5823 2GB/32GB 23MP 4.6-inch 4G LTE Factory Unlocked (CORAL RED) - International Stock No Warranty",3,"TL;DR PRO/CON list at bottom.I will start off this review by saying that I really wanted to love this phone. It does have some very good qualities about it. But the phone has its faults, which are enough for me to not give this phone a recommendation. I have used the phone for approximately 6 months.By background is that I worked in the cell phone industry selling phones for years, before moving into corporate IT and networking. I have been a amateur phone enthusiast and have easily had over 30 phones in my day. I also take exceptional care of my belongings, electronics getting special care. Seeing as this phone is a bit expensive for the size, it was a bit of a treat for myself as the specs and design looked like everything I wanted.HardwareScreen is a nice size for one handed use. Is very crisp and easy to see inside and outside in bright sunlight. Physical buttons are a tad awkward being so low on the device, but worked well for how I hold a phone. They provide enough click, but are a little hard to ""feel out"" and press during a call. Volume on the dual speakers is adequate for a small phone and produce decent sound. Sound through earphones is very good. 2 GB of RAM is more than enough to power the 720p screen and the 810 processor never lets up. The fingerprint scanner is top notch. Works very fast and recognizes fingers well. It allows 5 fingers to be registered. I did my wife's thumb, left index, right index, and my right thumb twice for better accuracy on my main digit. Sometimes I would pull the phone out of my pocket and it would already have registered my thumb and unlocked itself.UI, Performance, and Battery LifeThis phone came with Android Lollipop and is now updated to Marshmallow. The UI runs well. The fast processor and 2 GB of RAM don't let this phone slow down much if at all. Sony's take on Android is a very clean and minimal. Although there is plenty of Sony ""bloatware"" apps that come preinstalled and cannot be removed. You can ""disable"" them so they are no longer active and don't appear in the menu, but still live on the device. The Snapdragon 810 does still tend to get hot at random times. An app may be running in the background and you can feel the phone get much warmer. Never hot that you feel in danger, but warm enough to warranty a reboot in my opinion. Once back up the device was cool again. Battery life on the phone is decent, but not close to the expectation that Sony has set with previous devices in the series. It will get you through a day easily with moderate to heavy use, and can easily stretch to two days with light use. Recharge time however is very long. If you plug into a PC to charge expect at least 3 - 4 hours to charge it up. A quick charge adapter is a wise investment if you get this phone.Apps and GamingI largely got this phone for remote play on the PS4; that feature worked wonderfully with no issues. While the small screen was a little hard to see at times, I never had an issue with pairing the PS4 controller via bluetooth or playing over WiFi. The stock messaging app always gave me trouble with MMS messages, even with the correct settings from AT&T. I constantly got a you have an MMS to download message even though I already read the message. Textra fixed that issue and is a much better messaging app in my opinion. I don't really play any other types of mobile games, but companion apps for Destiny, Metal Gear Solid V, and standard apps like The Weather Channel all ran great on the device. As mentioned before there is A LOT of Sony branded items that are just flat out annoying and not needed.CameraWonderful camera. Loved to take pictures with this phone. They almost always come out clear and sharp. With the latest updates the camera opens quickly. The phone does a good job of fast auto-focus as promised. The shutter key on the side of the device is great for open the camera quickly and nice to take a picture. Finger placement while holding the phone is a bit awkward as the camera is very close the the top edge of the phone and gets covered easy if you are not careful. I spent most of my time in superior auto mode which produces 8 mp images. Going into manual will give you an overwhelming amount of options and allow full 23 mp pictures.DesignLooking at the phone it screams premium. Add waterproofing to the device and that is just piece of mind that some rain or accidental spills will not harm the device. No flap for the charge port is also wonderful as I've seen my share of them get damaged on phone such as the Galaxy S5 which kills the waterproofing of the device. The phone has a heafty weight to it that also feels good. The frosted glass back looks very nice and does not attract fingerprints. The phone is very slippery. On a scale of 1 to 10 with 1 being course grit sand paper and 10 being metal coated in Teflon covered in olive oil, this phone is a 9 easy. The phone literally wants to slide out of your hand whenever you hold it. If nothing else a case is needed to provide some grip to the phone. Having a glass front and back also made me extra cautious and nervous about potential cracks. But I have always taken care of my devices and never cracked a screen.Phone callsPhone calls on the device were clean on my end every time. There were issues for the other caller especially when I used speaker phone. Callers would often complain that they heard themselves or that they could not hear me until I went back to the earpiece. It also appeared that using the speaker phone only used the bottom speaker and not both.DurabilityThis phone is by its very nature fragile. With over 90% of the outer casing being glass, you better believe this baby is delicate. The phone came with a pre-installed screen protector, but it became cruddy very fast. I normally don't use a screen protector and have never had an issue. I somehow managed to put a small scratch on the screen while it was in my pocket with NOTHING else in it one day while hiking. It was no big deal, as I couldn't see it when the screen was on, but I knew it was there and worried me that it got damaged so easily. Now just recently a friend placed my phone near a counter edge, and a got a few messages in a row that made the device vibrate right off the edge. Of course it landed face down on kitchen tile. Screen completely shattered and the touch screen stopped functioning altogether. I am not knocking this phone because of my stupid mistake, not many phones if any would survive a fall like that. Instead it just goes to show that a rugged case is just about required for this device. Which is a huge bummer since the phone looks so good.TL;DR and PROS/CONS ListPROS-- Nice screen for a smaller phone-- Beautiful design-- Great camera-- Fast performance-- Sony's UI has a good design-- Waterproof-- Native PS4 remote playCons-- Sony bloatware that cannot be removed, just disabled-- Slippery-- Fragile-- Poor speaker phone quality for the other caller-- Awkward button placement-- Very slow charge time-- Expensive-- Sony is slow to update UIConclusion and thoughtsThe phone is not worth the price. The camera is very nice and waterproofing is a big plus, but a few nice features do not outweigh the fact you are terrified to accidentally drop such an expensive phone. If you don't let anyone else touch this phone, and put it in a really hard-core case, it may last you a good while. If you live in the real world where you may leave you phone on a desk, give it to someone to take a picture of you, or bump into something with the phone in your pocket it may be dropped and will break."

I would say that the experience with Z5 is fairly similar - everything is fast and smooth, the camera is nice. This phone apparently came from Hong Kong (or something like this).

My music app starts to play by itself out of blue, which gave me couple of embarrassing moments during meetings.Then the screen cracked. Well, that was my fault. I fixed that by spending 170 dollars more on this stupid phone. And then the front camera is broken. Just to make a double down, my text function starts to fail. My screen turned completely black when I am making a phone call.I don't think SONY is even trying to sell their cellphones. I bought it because it's cute.

This is the best phone out there for my needs right now and I believe this size of phone will make a huge comeback as it is truly ideal, great job Sony!

The problems with this phone are that it started to slow down over time because it began overheating. It becomes unresponsive and then apps crash. A separate issue is when it randomly reboots. This is unrelated to overheating. I honestly really like the device, but what's practical about an overheating supercar? Nothing. I remove 3 stars for overheating, software issues, and because they were severe enough that I had to return the device."

"397315","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact E5823 2GB/32GB 23MP 4.6-inch 4G LTE Factory Unlocked (CORAL RED) - International Stock No Warranty",5,"Firstly, I don't often review products, and even less often am I this satisfied with a smartphone. As a consumer, I'm incredibly attentive to the small details in a product, and if the issue is annoying enough, I'll return it. Not so with the Xperia Z5 Compact (Z5c from here on). In more detail below:DISPLAY:Stunning LCD with virtually no light bleed. Colors are well saturated, and almost approach AMOLED in the level of depth. Whites are accurate, and text overall is sharp. I prefer AMOLED for the true blacks, but this is a very solid LCD. If I had one complaint, it's that the circuitry is sometimes visible in bright light behind the display.DESIGN:The phone fits in the hand very well. The sides are very easy to grip on to, and the frosted finish on the back glass is a huge improvement over the previous Xperia devices. The fingerprint scanner on the power button is extremely accurate and fast. I would have placed the volume button a bit higher than Sony did, however. I haven't tested the waterproofing, but it's a useful feature to have.PERFORMANCE:I was concerned at first about the Snapdragon 810 in the device, and heat issues, but so far, I haven't felt any extreme heating. It does definitely get warm during use, but no more than say, a Samsung Galaxy S6. It's very fast, and for gaming, the 720p display serves it well. Some users have reported performance issues or lagging through the UI, particularly when an SD card is inserted, though I've not noticed any of these. I also have had no issues with streaming Bluetooth audio.BATTERY:I don't think this device will last 2 days on a single charge, though it absolutely can get through a single day's use. I spend roughly half of my day in a low signal area, which I expect would affect this, and thus, lower the battery life. In a stronger signal environment, it would probably last longer.CAMERA:The camera is excellent. The photos are crisp, and sharp on most subjects. Low-light performance could be better, but I have no real complaints with the camera.MISC:It doesn't support Wi-Fi calling, or VoLTE on T-Mobile, though I doubt this can be helped, considering it's an international model.Overall, this is the best option if you're looking for a compact Android device. I'm certainly keeping it."

Prior to the Z5C I owned the Z3 (5.2 in screen) and I love that phone but I wanted something a bit smaller in hand. At first I was kind of iffy going from a 1080 to a 720 display resolution but honestly you can barely tell a difference. You would really have to pay close attention to the screen to point out the difference. I am glad I wen with the Z5C, it is a premium phone in a compact size. I've yet to try the camera but I did video recorder for a few minutes and the 4K recording is amazing. How can such a compact device record so well and crisp! Thank you Sony!"

The white color looks great. Good form factor but when the phone gets hot, it becomes uncomfortable to hold so I def recommend a case. The phone is also a bit thick though I suppose it's necessary due to the waterproof material and other hardware necessities to make it up to par with typical devices.The SIM and SD card slots are easily accessible. Fingerprint sensor works great and is super convenient. Battery life lasts a full day but I don't see it going past a full day on normal usage (I'm typically on wifi and 4G). Sony also releases frequent software updates which is amazing compared to manufacturers like Samsung and HTC that take forever to come out with updates. Recently there was a update which allows the camera to launch much faster."

Doesn't feel cheap or plasticky at all.• Screen is nice and bright. Call quality is excellent.• Easy to navigate screen interface one handed. Holding it correctly, with your pinkie under the bottom to support the phone, there should be no issue using one handed. Your thumb should be able to reach all spots on the display. As far as I know, this is the only newly released premium handset in this size/form factorThe bad:• Like the Z3C, the back is glass, although frosted this time so the grip is slightly better. Premium feel, but very fragile.• Despite the faster CPU, the interface is slower and not as instant as the Z3C when opening apps.• Battery life is not as good as the Z3C, but still better than any other premium smart phone out there. I was charging every other day with the Z3C, but must charge at the end of the day with the Z5C. This is with moderate use.• The camera is just above average. With Sony optics you would think it would be better than it is.• When taking a photo, the camera is slow to open, and even slower to preview a picture just taken. Can be an issue when trying to catch a moment at just the right time.• For T-mobile, although the hardware supports band 12, T-mobile's 700MHz spectrum, it is not enabled. So you may find spotty reception in areas where you had excellent reception in the past with a T-mobile phone purchased from the carrier. This is more a carrier issue than Sony, since the support is there built into the hardware."

The phone will have android version 5.1.1 (lollipop) straight out of the package with a few pre-installed software that you can delete. After just receiving this phone I noticed that the design was different, and the original fingerprint magnet glass on the rear of the phone from the z3c is replaced by frosted glass. So No more finger prints. Also the phone is slightly more thicker than the z3c and the edges are more round with a matte feel to it. There is only one flap on the left side to insert a memory card or micro SD card on the side. The volume keys are now under the power button which needs getting used to for me. The phone can be charged from the bottom using a micro USB cable which is included. You no longer have to open a flap to charge the phone which doesn't change the fact that the phone is still water proof/resistant. The power button is now longer providing a finger print sensor which works flawlessly so far. I haven't got much time into the user interface but have noticed that the display is very dim compared to the z3c if the adaptive brightness setting is on. So far it feels responsive, no lag, a few tweaks in the UI, and 4G LTE works fine for me. The camera is now 23 MP with fast auto focus, and the front facing camera is 5 MP. Overall great phone, but design could have been better and display is still 720p.UPDATE: Dropped phone on concrete from just above 3ft (with no case), and slightly dented the phone's edge. Screen survived any cracks or damage and phone still works fine."

I was looking for a multi function (smart) phone not a tablet that also has a phone. For me, bigger is not better. The phone is fast, has enough storage for most people and also that storage can be expanded by up to 100Gb via SD card. After reading the write-ups, I decided that this was the right one. I then had to decide which model, US or International and which vendor. I chose the international model, E5823 because it was a tad lower price but more importantly has the fingerprint reader (left off of the E5803, US model). There were two other criteria - would Sony honor the warranty in the US? Answer from Sony, yes. It may take a couple more days to process, but no warranty issue. Their service center is in Laredo Texas. Also, I wanted to know where I might have to return the phone if it arrived DOA (it didn't). Some vendors require shipping back to Europe or Hong Kong at a cost of $50-$60. No way on that. I chose to buy from CANGURO through Amazon. They are in Chicago and back the product from there. They answered all of my questions. EXCELLENT seller! There is one issue with the phone and it's a software issue. It was not enough for me to downgrade the rating, but might be an issue for you. After upgrading to Android 6.0, Marshmallow, the FM radio freezes after 15-20 minutes. It sometimes requires re-booting the phone to exit the app. Sony has promised a fix."

"397335","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact E5823 2GB/32GB 23MP 4.6-inch 4G LTE Factory Unlocked (CORAL RED) - International Stock No Warranty",5,"Long story short: this is the phone that finally convinced me to make the jump from Apple's iOS. I had been considering making the jump for some time, but I had yet to find an Android phone that matched the build quality and performance of my iPhone 6S. The z5 Compact finally did convinced me.Pros:+ Same size screen as the iPhone 6S, despite being smaller and lighter.+ Excellent build quality - the phone feels premium, solid and well made. I don't worry about anything breaking if I drop it once or twice.+ Waterproof!+ Very little manufacturer bloatware, especially compared to Samsung or LG. Among other things, this means that future Android updates will hit this phone sooner than many other Android devices.+ I actually most of the bloatware that's included. Sony's launcher is fast and responsive - I'm actually using it instead of the official Google launcher.+ Camera is high quality.+ Better battery life than my iPhone 6s+ Fingerprint scanner+ Plenty of processing power - I haven't yet seen the phone slow down or choke on any app I've thrown at it.Cons:- Cases options for this phone in the U.S. are limited when compared to the dancing plethora of iPhone cases that flood every electronics store, website, gas station and grocery store.- Because this is the international version of the phone, there's no warranty- Because this is the international version of the phone, some apps think I'm in Ireland. I'm sure a simple setting could easily change this, but I haven't yet found it.- Fingerprint scanner doesn't work as well as iPhone 6S (though it's still good). I think this is mainly due to the fact that the scanner is smaller than the iPhone scanner, so it has less to work with.Overall, I've found this phone to be the perfect fit for me. It really hits the sweet spot of combining the power, battery life, screen size and non-bloated OS that I've been looking for."

Also the camera is great and on equal level with a galaxy S7. Unfortunately the phone gets pretty hot under normal use, and the UI is very buggy which makes the phone unenjoyable to use.

I've only owned Nexi before this, but I find Sony's customizations are almost all additive, like glove mode or being able to reboot or screenshot with a click of the power button. Any uninstallable apps you don't like, just disable in Settings.I use mine without a case and with a lanyard (not included, but I bought some silver ones on Amazon for about $5), which adds no bulk, keeps the phone pure but like a case, offers (preventative) protection against drops. Some have complained about the ""lip"" of the outer frame, but I don't find it remotely bothersome in hand and it protects the glass. It's functional - something any great design must be, not just beautiful. I laugh at all the iPhones wearing ugly cases.I have noticed a couple of intermittent software bugs here & there (example: blacks sometimes look gray when waking from sleep and auto-adjust brightness is on) but nothing I can't live with, and Sony has OTA-air shipped both a firmware and a camera update in the month I've owned the phone.Battery life is great, solidly over a day with moderatly heavy screen-on time use and up to two days with Stamina mode enabled.Just buy it.

The main features I was looking for in a new phone were small size and battery life and I don' think it gets any better than the Z5 compact. My previous phone was a Droid Mini because it was the smallest Android phone available on Verizon. I was hesitant to switch from Verizon because I had been with them for a decade, but I have had no problems so far on AT&T and the Z5 Compact performs great and feels great (much better than the plasticky Droid Mini). In terms of battery life I would take the Mini off of the charger at 7am and with light-average usage it would be dead by 4pm. The same routine with the Z5 Compact always shows more than 65% battery remaining at 4pm."

There is no other way to put it. It's hands-down the most premium feeling phone I've held - and that's with it swinging against the big guns such as the S6 Edge, HTC One, and iPhone 6.Cons:-I'm not a huge fan of the frosted back, and think it would have looked better with a normal glass back or just a continuation of the excellent plastic used for the sides. This is largely personal preference though.-The volume rocker is in an extremely awkward position. Unlike the Z3 Compact, you really have to work to use it. Would have been better located above the power button.-It comes in Japanese, and it's very difficult to find the language setting. Pull down the notification bar, then again for settings, click the gear, scroll down to the keyboard, then the top setting.Pros:-The fingerprint sensor/power button is fantastic. It's placed perfectly, works fast, and has just the right feel.-Impeccable fit and finish.-Near stock android.-Design.-Specs.-Camera button, which is sadly a dying feature. The quick-launch ability alone makes it worth having."

This phone is exactly what the iPhone users are hanging onto, a sub 5 inch phone with competitive specs. The 720p resolution is totally fine for the size of the screen. If you feel like it is a big sacrifice, just remember it improves the battery life (up to 2 days). The camera is pretty amazing and the expandable memory (micro sd) is also a breath of fresh air coming from an iPhone. If you want the freedom of Android and a reasonably priced phone (unlike the iPhone), then do not hesitate, BUY IT!"

The screen looks great, it's snappy, and I even like that it's not so thin. Really thin phones are hard to hold and even cramp my hands sometimes. Battery life is about average. Fingerprint sensor works great. Although battery isn't removable, SD and Sim cards are. I really wish Sony success because I'd hate to see this line of phones go away."

Prior to the Z5C I owned the Z3 (5.2 in screen) and I love that phone but I wanted something a bit smaller in hand. At first I was kind of iffy going from a 1080 to a 720 display resolution but honestly you can barely tell a difference. You would really have to pay close attention to the screen to point out the difference. I am glad I wen with the Z5C, it is a premium phone in a compact size. I've yet to try the camera but I did video recorder for a few minutes and the 4K recording is amazing. How can such a compact device record so well and crisp! Thank you Sony!"

Sure, the camera is great, but it takes forever for the camera app to load and and focus on shots. The speed of the phone I love. The weight of the phone is more on the heavier side. I wish it was lighter and also thinner. The phone is a little thick and the volume rocker is in an awkward position. I like the dedicated camera button and I love the features the phone comes with inside its settings. I don't enjoy the placement of the front camera and it also takes some crappy photos as compared with photos taken from the front camera on the iPhone.

"397358","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact E5823 2GB/32GB 23MP 4.6-inch 4G LTE Factory Unlocked (CORAL RED) - International Stock No Warranty",3," There is a lot to like about the phone but there are a variety of issues too:1. Most importantly: this phone has a problem with touchscreen sensitivity in the lower part of the screen when the phone is not held in hand. It is particularly bad on some surfaces such as on a bed. Also the problem gets much worse if you install a glass protective screen. It starts being very noticeable on almost all surfaces.I've made a quick demonstration video about the issue (see below). Other users have reported this issue with their phone https://talk.sonymobile.com/t5/Xperia-Z5-Z5-Compact-Z5-Premium/z5-compact-touchscreen-acting-weird/m-p/1079627/highlight/false#M6713Therefore it is a design defect by Sony. Surprisingly it appears to affect only the white version of the phone.2. It does heat up quite a lot during normal use (like updating apps) or watching videos. And the battery is drained faster than on previous version that I have (Z1 Compact)3. I didn't see any improvement in photo quality compared to the old Z1 (in fact some pics look worse in identical settings). At the same time there is a substantial improvement in focusing and in video quality."
"397359","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact E5823 2GB/32GB 23MP 4.6-inch 4G LTE Factory Unlocked (CORAL RED) - International Stock No Warranty",4,"I have had this phone for 2 weeks now, and I still have things to evaluate, but so far these are my observations when compared to the features of my prior Galaxy S4 miniFirst pros. this is truly an amazing phone with so many features well beyond my previous Samsung S4 mini. The screen is great, and let's you choose enhancements to it that make pictures and videos really stand out. A 23 MP camera, take very good (albeit large sized) pictures; I have yet to try it in darker situations, where apparently it has been challenged in other reviews. It runs smoothly even when multiple apps are open, and its a breeze to switch between apps. The finger scanner works neatly, although the location will only allow you to use it with your right hand; you can also set up multiple users or guests to the phone, with their own apps, settings and finger scans (kind of like a computer profile), which is great for kids not messing up your settings. It has a ton of customizable phone features for screen, power management sounds, app management, that I was no where close to have with the smaller Galaxy -you can program what the phone will do when you plug it to the charger, when it connects with your car's bluetooh, or when you plug in head phones, so different apps can activate automatically. I do not own a PS3, but apparently you can hook it up somehow to PS3 controllers and play games through it (sounds like a cool feature); it also offers you a lot of connectivity options to external devices like Chromecast. Something I really liked was the corrector/dictionary, actually allows me to type in two different languages and word suggestions come in both without specifying or switching between languages,while keeping your keyboard in the desired setting. Aesthetically the phone looks nice, with a smooth finish front and back; the side material does look on the cheap side though, it would have been nice to have metal on the side instead, but that may hamper the waterproofing capabilities (it says waterproof, but I have n o intention of testing that on a phone w/o warranty). The back is also made of a glassy finish, which does make it a bit slippery in your hands. Finally, the size of the phone (the main thing that drove me to it) is great for its category; Sony really put a lot of features into a small package, making it feel like a flagship rather than a 2nd tier mini version you find of other smaller phones.So for the cons: Its not really the phones fault, but this is a european phone on american network, which means its not fully compatible (at least with Tmobile). It lacks the 3G 1700 band, all other bands apparently are the same as Tmobile network. This has the phone constantly switching between 3G and HSDPA and will drain the battery out in a day or less. I tried the phone for a week in Florida (Ft Lauderdale area) and in Texas (Houston area) and it is about the same, in spite of being large metropolitan areas. I cant tell exactly if HSDPA is equivalent to 4G or 4G LTE connectivity speedwise, so when it is on that it seemed fast-ish. When I mean constant switching I mean sometimes you would actually have to move the phone around so it would get the signal right and download things. This, added to the low battery life, is somewhat annoying which is sad, because the phone does have these apparently great customizable battery saving features that tell you you should have the phone for more than a day without charge, of course it does not count on the phone switching between networks so frequently and battery barely lasts a day with moderate use.Maybe the phone works better on other carriers, it is truly unfortunate that Tmobile/Sony have not agreed to provide this phone on the US market, it is really an awesome phone by itself. If someone knows how to do away with the network issues, or of a carrier where it will work well, let me know"

"397364","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact E5823 2GB/32GB 23MP 4.6-inch 4G LTE Factory Unlocked (CORAL RED) - International Stock No Warranty",1,"**SEE UPDATE BELOW**I've been using this phone for over 3 weeks now and I so glad I went with the Z5C.HARDWAREIt heats up a bit when doing heavy gaming or long video recordings, but not all too concerning...especially considering I don't notice any heat during typical daily operation. I would say the battery is adequate but it wouldn't be considered one of the strengths of this phone. I don't imagine battery life gets any better with other phones unless you go bigger...which, why the hell would you be looking at this phone if you were willing to do that? Go with the Xperia Z5. That said, I haven't experimented too much with ""stamina mode"" but if you use alternate messaging services / apps (like Google Voice) or music streaming apps, you'll have to add those apps as exceptions to be able to use data when the screen is off...which will diminish the benefit of ""stamina mode"" and preclude you from using ""ultra stamina mode"" all together. This is my first Quick Charge 2.0 device and I'm very impressed with how much charge you can get out of having it plugged in a just a while (ie 10 minutes). Wireless charging would've been nice to have but I'll gladly sacrifice that feature to get dual front facing speakers, expandable memory, and water resistance.Speaking of expandable memory. My buddy was playing with a camera-equipped drone his girlfriend got him for Christmas and was bummed he couldn't get the videos off the micro SD card (he didn't have an adapter). Everyone at the party (iPhone users) was blown away at how I was able to get and share the video by putting the micro SD card in my phone and using Google Drive to share it. I don't know why we are letting phone manufacturers sucker us by buying phones without expandable memory.At 720p screen resolution / quality looks great to me. If reading small text is difficult or annoying or you plan on watching HD full-length movies on your phone, get a bigger phone. I have excellent eyesight and find this display great for watching YouTube videos or reading articles.I don't take a lot of photos / videos but I'm pleased with the camera so far. You can find great camera comparisons online. From what I found this camera is great but Samsungs perform better in low-light and close up focusing...but the Z5C is a huge step up from my HTC One M7 when it comes to low light pictures.SOFTWAREI was a big fan of HTC's Sense UI and didn't know how I'd like Sony's UI as this is my first smartphone from them. After downloading an HTC-like free clock / weather widget, I like the UI a lot. Screenshots and screen capture are particularly easy and fun. Still waiting for Android 6.0 Marshmallow update that was promised (see summary below).SUMMARYAs far as I know the perfect phone doesn't exist but based on the other flagship phones available right now and my preference for water-resistance, expandable memory, and front facing speakers...I was prepared to give this phone a perfect 5 stars. I'm giving it 4 however because it would appear that Sony is following the lead of others by promising ""soon"" updates to the latest android version (6.0 Marshmallow) to help sell their new flagship phone but then making those of us who believed them and bought the phone wait around while the update is delayed. If the update comes prior to the new year I'll adjust my review to 5 stars. Almost 3 months for an update seems like enough time to tailor Marshmallow to their UI...if it was a priority.**UPDATE**This is the worst phone I've ever had. On paper it's great but I've never been so frustrated with lagging issue. I'll get a phone call while its in my hand and I'll mis the call because pushing ""answer"" is non-responsive. Killing apps helps a bit but I find myself restarting the phone a lot. I was hoping the Marshmellow update would help but its now March 8th & still no update. First & last time I buy a Sony phone. Since the Galaxy S7 is water resistant with expandable memory, I think I'll get it if a softwarw update comes soon & fixes my problems."

It's only a little customised from stock Android and isn't always trying to sell you stuff like a Samsung device. The bloatware isn't too bad either and can be disabled. Sony includes a free service to locate, lock, or wipe your lost phone. Also software to copy over your old data. Very useful.Battery life really is good. My first day, it lasted until night which is quite good doing all of the setup and playing around. Under normal usage I have about 40% left at the end of the day--Wow! STAMINA mode seems really usable too for special times when you need extra battery life.The phone is small and very portable. It's not wafer thin, probably because of a larger battery. I don't find the thickness to be too much. Of course, with the smaller size you get a smaller screen. Is it worth the trade-off? Only you can decide.Performance is fast and flawless, which is unparalleled in a small phone. It doesn't seem to get particularly hot.The screen looks beautiful and the pixel density is plenty.I love the fingerprint sensor! Works great and so conveniently located. It's a shame they couldn't include this feature on the US model. I had Android encrypt the device for security, no problems.Volume control buttons seemed oddly placed at first, but they are out of the way and how often do you use them? Not that much.Camera, although it could be improved, is very usable as a compact camera. Dedicated camera button is very nice. Picture quality good, shutter delay fair.Water and dust sealing should be on EVERY phone. Great how it doesn't have fiddly flaps to cover all the ports.Audio quality is excellent and seems better than my old Samsung phone.No US warranty is unfortunate. If it breaks, I plan to pay for any repairs. I can live with the risk as a trade-off for the fingerprint scanner.Earbuds were included; thank you, Sony.Included charger had the international prong setup and included adapter for US outlets. Works fine, I have other chargers that work just as fine. Sometime I'll probably pick up a Quick Charge 2.0 charger.Overall, a super package! I'm so happy with it."

Button layout is perfect for one hand use. Bezel space is small, front stereo speakers are cool.Software wise... This phone is a joke. I had low expectations going in but was surprised at how bad it really is. The camera sucks, theres no way to say it's good at anything. Stereo speakers on front aren't same volume so it's a rather odd sound when viewing videos. Luminosity of auto brightness is all over the place, all of the time. And then there's overheating. The 810 in here should have been called dragons breath because it leaves the phone inoperable at times. I haven't shot 4k video or even played games yet and it gets above 170 just browsing the web. Charging the phone gets it to about 140 also.. and if you get a phone call or have to actually touch the phone, you get burned.All in all,if you're not a heavy user or you are coming from an iPhone, you'll probably like it. Otherwise I wouldn't recommend it."

"397377","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact E5823 2GB/32GB 23MP 4.6-inch 4G LTE Factory Unlocked (CORAL RED) - International Stock No Warranty",3,"I agree with most of the other reviews that state that this is a great reasonably sized phone. Since they already detail the good parts, I'll spare you the extra words.That said, its battery life, size, and camera quality are marred by mediocre Bluetooth performance, camera app unresponsiveness, and poor stability.I've noticed Bluetooth audio with aptX can stutter. While it only happens twice in the included demo video (at 0:44 and 1:10), it can happen rather frequently if there's a lot going on in the background. It's very distracting whenever it happens. I strongly believe that the issue lies with the Z5C's aptX codec:* The headphones in question are the Plantronics BackBeat PRO Wireless Noise Canceling Hi-Fi Headphones with Mic - Compatible with iPhone, iPad, Android, and Other Smart Devices. In my testing, they work fine on the Nexus 4 and OnePlus One (Android phones that *don't* support aptX), and on an iPad and MacBook Pro (Apple devices that *do* support aptX).* Additionally, all of the non-aptX receivers I've tried with this phone work fine. As of this writing, this includes the Amazon Echo, Honda CR-V HandsFreeLink, JayBird BBX1MB BlueBuds X Sport Bluetooth Headphones - Black (Discontinued by Manufacturer), and the HomeSpot NFC-Enabled Bluetooth Audio Receiver for Sound System.Despite the inclusion of a Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 in the phone, it's not very responsive. While taking a video, the camera app appears to stutter and drop a few frames every few seconds. It can be very difficult to stop taking a video - the phone will appear to still be capturing frames, but pressing the stop button can occasionally do nothing. Once the phone is in this state, nothing on the screen will respond including the back, home, and task switcher buttons (even though the camera still updates as you move the phone around). The only way out is to hard reboot (which can take up to three minutes if you have device encryption enabled). If you close the camera using the home button or the task switcher, the rest of the phone becomes very slow until you reopen the camera and close it using the back button.As for stability, I'll just leave the text of my initial 1-star review here:After successfully using this phone for navigation, I put it back in my pocket. When I took it out an hour later, it wouldn't turn back on. I could tell it wasn't a suddenly dead battery because the phone vibrated whenever I put my finger on the fingerprint sensor. I tried a hard reboot by removing and replacing the SIM card and the phone has been unresponsive since then.This is a real shame especially because there are no other decent phones on the market at this form factor (except maybe the Z3 Compact, which I've seen run into the exact same problem).Eventually I figured out that the problem was because Android crashed pretty hard since pressing and holding the ""OFF"" button hidden behind the SIM/SD cover brought the phone back to a working state."
"397378","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact E5823 2GB/32GB 23MP 4.6-inch 4G LTE Factory Unlocked (CORAL RED) - International Stock No Warranty",5,"I got to say after 5 days of use, I absolutely love this phone. The small compact size is perfect for me and I don't mind the thickness, I assume it's thicker than most to put that bigger battery in. I thought it would be hard to go small since I'm coming from the iPhone 6 Plus, but wasn't bad at all in my opinion. This is actually the first android phone that I can say I won't be going back to my iPhone. I get about 1 1/2 days of battery life at moderate use. so far my screen on time averages 4 hours, best was 4 hours 45 minutes. My last android phone was the 2015 moto x pure and that battery life was horrible along with others I have owned, nexus 5x, Htc one m7, m8, m9, nexus 5, and so on which always made me go back to my iPhone along with other reasons. I am in the United States and with At&t and can confirm LTE works perfectly. No issues at all. Also I didn't have to manually put in the APN for mms or Internet to work, u just make sure u have wifi connected and then go to settings, then more, then scroll down and hit internet settings. Hit download and it will automatically download the correct settings for your carrier, make sure your carrier sim is installed. The camera is good enough for me, I'm no professional photographer so I just leave it in superior auto mode and it takes good pics in my opinion. I can confirm the phone back does get a little warm during some situations. First one was downloading all my apps from the play store at the same time. 2nd is using hangouts for video calls, other than that it has been fine. The heat it did get did not burn my hand and was still comfortable to hold and use. I did get the DP glass screen protector which I put on all my phones and I like it. I'm not a case kind of guy so waiting on my dbrand skin. I did get the white version and I have not had any screen issues or my on screen buttons not working on my bed. I assume others just got a defective unit. I got usb cord, earbuds, and a international plug in the box. Just a side not I only have one hand and am super happy that a company actually makes a one handed device with great specs. Most android phones I've had one handed use was very difficult if not impossible but had no choice if wanted top specs, so thank you Sony for high end specs in a compact size."

The z1c had the highest build quality in my opinion (the metal casing exuding the appearance of ""high-end""). The z5c is a step down from here, although the performance is updated, the phone does not look or feel high-end in your palm. This isn't a huge deal to me as I primarily use this phone for travel; the small size, waterproofing, and low-key appearance are all assets. However unlike the z1c, I don't enjoy using the z5c at home in the states. One big gripe for me has been the fingerprint scanner. The iPhone will read and unlock my prints 90% of the time, the z5c is probably more like 60% for me. I'm sure experiences will vary.In all its a mediocre phone, but given the choices out there, it is by far the best Android in this size. The vanilla-like Android experience Sony installs is appreciated as well-- its the closest you can get out of the box without buying a Nexus imho."

"397389","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact E5823 2GB/32GB 23MP 4.6-inch 4G LTE Factory Unlocked (CORAL RED) - International Stock No Warranty",5,"I bought this for my wife, to replace her (still functional, just aging) Moto G LTE (1st Gen). If you're looking at this product, you're probably aware of the general lack of high-end, small-form-factor Android phones. If you want high-end, you usually have to get something substantially larger than this, and my wife did not want a larger phone. She also wanted something with a much better camera. The z5 compact delivers. She's had it a month now, and she likes it a lot. (I've used it quite a bit as well). The camera is responsive and extremely high quality - it does fairly well in low light as well. The battery life is nothing short of outstanding. Sony's take on Android squashes battery consumption when the phone is idle, even with background apps (facebook messenger, facebook, various google services) all running. I've used a moto x (1st gen), moto x (2nd gen), moto g LTE (1st gen) all recently -- this phone has markedly better battery life than those. It's also stable and fast - the only (very) minor gripe one could have about this phone is Sony's mild modification to the UI, which is not stock. I don't really like the blue menu bars on settings & so on, but once the thing is set up, you shouldn't have to go in to those... so this is mostly a nonissue. Also, the Sony/xperia migration tool made migrating sms messages, pictures, and so on a breeze. This phone is fantastic.Regarding cell coverage and compatibility, we use this phone with Cricket Wireless, which is an AT&T MVNO. The ""bars"" meter apparently is calibrated a bit lower than other phones (ie, displaying 3 bars vs 4, etc), but the actual dB reading is the same as my moto phones on the same carrier in the same location. I'd expect this phone to work absolutely fine with post-paid AT&T service as well, seeing as how it works without issue on their prepaid subsidiary. I cannot vouch for whether or not the carriers can actually activate a new SIM on this phone, however -- I took her old SIM (already activated), cut it, and put it in this phone, which worked fine. I did have to put in the access point (AP) settings, but that's standard practice if you're used to Cricket or other prepaid carriers.re: warranty, I get squaretrade warranties for phones anyway. I'm not sweating the alleged lack of US warranty, though other reports are mixed as to whether Sony would really give you the cold shoulder if you had a legitimate hardware issue with the device.The phone came with an international AC converter to convert it to US 120V to... something else. I live in the United States. I'm not intimately familiar with exactly what kind of converter this is. It comes with a US 120V to USB charger in the box, and then is bundled with this international AC-to-US120V-AC adapter outside. It also has a pair of earbuds in the box."

"397391","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact E5823 2GB/32GB 23MP 4.6-inch 4G LTE Factory Unlocked (CORAL RED) - International Stock No Warranty",5,"So this isn't actually black. It's a gunmetal grey. I originally settled for black because none of the other colors appealed to me and I am glad that I did now. The color of gunmetal grey looks wonderful and the phone itself is above and beyond all of the ""competition."" The phone is smaller than most smart phones these days but does anything and everything you want it to do. It even has one of the fastest (if not the fastest) processors onboard. My only issue is that it does get a little hot if you're using it for an extended amount of time to do anything too extreme. Wonderful phone though, I made sure to order plenty of tempered glass protectors for the front and back to ensure that I keep this little gem safe. Would highly recommend."
"397392","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact E5823 2GB/32GB 23MP 4.6-inch 4G LTE Factory Unlocked (CORAL RED) - International Stock No Warranty",5,"Phone arrived in 2 days. I am a US customer looking to use the unit with ATT. I received it on Tuesday, and end of day Thursday today, the phone is fully setup customized and functional, but for the carrier. I had some lingering items to wrap up on my old phone, and today I'll be getting ATT service connected. My goal was to keep a smaller phone (~4.5"") like my previous unit to preserve the 1 handed capability, and convenient pocket fit. I don't want a tablet for a phone, and have struggled to find a good modern model match for my needs. The Z5C looked to be a great match, and so far, it's a perfect fit for me.Package appeared to have been opened, however carefully, and then re-sealed. I suspect the reason it was opened was the addition of a US plug adapter for the EU style plug the unit comes with, as it does not look like a Sony converter. Where the phone uses a pretty standard 5V, 1500mA mUSB charger, of which I have a bunch, this wasn't a big deal. All other packages in the box (headphones, USB cable, extra earbud cushions, documents) were all intact and looked brand new, untouched. Phone itself still had original sticky film and packaging, and was in perfect new condition.Phone turned right on, and was ~60% charged. I was prompted quickly to change the language (second or third screen) as I ran setup from German to English I organized the OS as I prefer my phone laid out and set up and connected to wifi. The phone immediately ran two major system updates in parallel, and then after a restart, ran another. I'm now on Android 5.1.1, and admittedly, I'm not sure what it shipped with before the updates as they happened so fast.I love the square edges, which allow for some grip in a smartphone world where everything is slick and like holding onto a watersock if you don't have a cover on it. The phone looks like a sleek, black slab of sexy tech. Seriously, what a cool looking, striking design. The photos don't do it justice. I did buy a low profile cover for drop protection, and have used it intermittently. Compared to the IPhone 6 or the new Galaxy Edge, this is much easier to hold one handed without worrying about it squirting onto the pavement. That said, it's still a pretty slick and smooth piece of hardware in general, and I'd suggest a cover/protection.The phone is a great unit, and a perfect fit for my needs. I love the frosted glass back, the large screen/body ratio, and the charcoal colored polycarb frame.. I know some people take stars away for not liking the case/finish (non metal), but I find that odd. If you don't like it, why'd you drop $500 on it? It's a first class material, so the rest is just opinion. It actually has a pretty metallic look anyways. No one's going to look at this and say ""man, what a cheap looking phone. I promise. Phone does get a bit warm (which I really only experienced during the initial startup/setup), but there's a lot of horsepower in there, and that's to be expected. Nothing that bothered me.The fingerprint tech is awesome, and responds quickly and flawlessly. I have a few different fingers stored so that it's a comfortable unlock both righty and lefty. The hardware is clearly sufficient, as I've had a dozen things going on at once including downloading, a bluetooth beam, installing and updating apps, surfing a few internet tabs and writing a note all at once, and Android ran smooth, slick, quick and didn't break a sweat. Phone a very *solid* feel, very high quality, and certainly a first class phone that can be discussed in the circles of the current high end smartphone competition.Two minor drawbacks that I didn't think were worth removing a star for:1) No wireless charging. If the unit didn't have the rapid charge capability, this may have been a -1, but it charges so damned fast, and keeps charge so long, I couldn't do it. Still would be cool to drop it on those powermats at starbucks. Oh well.2) Volume buttons are too low on the thumb side (righty.) These should have been up top. I'm guessing there was a hardware conflict, but either way, it's a nitpick worth mentioning.Setup with personal and work emails was seamless, and calendar, emails and contacts all downloaded via wifi quickly and easily.I'm headed to ATT to finalize my new account and get the carrier service completed. Unless you see a follow up note from me, assume it also went smoothly."

It is also very very fast, water resistant, very good battery life, looks very good, unreal 4k video(tested and impressed... pausing the video looks like a photo even on a large monitor), has a clear sharp display, great audio and a fantastic (for a phone) camera. I loved my Sony ZL phone, got it wet so then went to the Z1 which is great but too big and heavy for me. This is the best phone out there for my needs right now and I believe this size of phone will make a huge comeback as it is truly ideal, great job Sony! (PS I am on T-Mobile and I don't think I am getting LTE but still quite fast and battery drain is not an issue)"
"397406","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact E5823 2GB/32GB 23MP 4.6-inch 4G LTE Factory Unlocked (CORAL RED) - International Stock No Warranty",1,"I bought this phone as a replacement for my Z1 which I had for over two and half years. I had zero issues with it until I shattered the screen. The Xperia line of phones are touted as being waterproof or at least they were initially. Sony seems to have shied away from that position now and for good reason. You see, I originally bought the Z1 for three main reasons: the 20mp camera, water resistance, build quality. My experience with the Z1 lead me to believe that the Z5c would be a suitable replacement. I assumed that the Z5c would certainly exceed the standards set by the Z1. I was wrong.Firstly, the positives1) The camera of the Z5c does outperform the Z1's especially in low light conditions. The overall picture quality is only slightly better, however.2) The UI is smoother and faster, likely due to the more powerful CPU3) Slightly better battery life4) Twice the storage capacity5) No flap cover for the USB slot6) Louder speakersThe negatives1) Plastic frame. The phone feels cheap compared to the Z1. It also is less damage resistant than the metal Z12) Frosted glass back plate. While it looks nice, it makes the phone slick and therefore harder to hold3) Build quality and water resistanceI assumed that the Z5c would be even more watertight than the Z1 since it has a higher IP certification. Nope. Even though I swam with my Z1 dozens of times, occasionally exceeding its depth rating, I never once had any issues. I would even wash it in the sink weekly. The phone was waterproof until I broke the screen. The Z5c, on the other hand, died the very moment it touched water. It was thoroughly waterlogged as if it lacked a water resistant seal entirely.Sony's repair service only made matters worse. They claimed that my Z5c was made for the Polish market (what?) and that there are no repair centers in the US. I was given an address in England to ship it and they said they would pay for Royal Mail shipping. Naturally, they could not seeing as how there are no Royal Mail offices in the US. Despite paying for shipping, Sony fixed the phone free of charge since it was under warranty. The turn around time was a bit over a month. I believe I got lucky as I have read that Sony will not honor warranty claims that are the result of water damage.So I go to turn the phone on and all seems well. At this point, I'm just glad to finally have my phone back. However, to my dismay the volume key does not work. They replaced the screen along with many internal components and performed a diagnostics test and yet somehow the broken volume key passed the test. What the heck. Every Xperia phone lets you run a simple pass/fail diagnostic test in the settings menu. One of the tests is for the volume rocker key. I don't understand how they missed this.I reached out to Sony again who said to ship the phone to them. And so I did. Over three weeks went by before I asked them for a status update. They told me they did not receive my phone. Strange. USPS stated that it passed customs and marked it as delivered. A couple more weeks go by before I receive an international package at my door. I thought maybe they had fixed my phone without notifying me. A foolish thought. What happened was that the Sony Service Center refused to take possession of the package so it was returned to me. Apparently there was a customs fee that they would not pay, despite stating that they would pay for shipping both ways. Since I paid for shipping to them both times they could have at least paid the measly fee. Why would Sony pays for it the first time but not the second? I asked USPS if I could pay the fee upfront and I was told I cannot.I've had it with Sony. Clearly the quality of their phones isn't what it used to be, not to mention the quality of their customer service. I'll update this review if Sony rectifies the situation. Don't hold your breath though."

Fits well into any pocket, including women's jeans! (This was a problem for me with larger phones.) Fingerprint scanner is a great feature and the camera is great; I haven't tested how waterproof it is yet, but it's nice to not worry about it in rain etc. Software all runs smoothly and I have yet to come up on anything the phone struggles to do.Rated down by 1 star as it tends to heat up and drain battery relatively quickly, though. It's excellent in 60º (F) weather where the air temp naturally compensates, but as it gets up to 80s or 90s the battery just burns up if you're using the screen a lot."
"397412","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact E5823 2GB/32GB 23MP 4.6-inch 4G LTE Factory Unlocked (CORAL RED) - International Stock No Warranty",5,"OK I didn't wanna post any review within a few days of my possession to avoid looking like snap judgment. So I had this phone for about a month now and I gotta say I'm very pleased with it. The display is so beautiful and the clarity is high. Even on low brightness. I thought the screen might be too small for me but it's perfect. I have small hands myself. Now I don't have to stretch my thumb across the screen to text messages. I can text comfortably with one hand. The battery life is just AWESOME!!!! Coming from a MOTO X that could barely last one day, I was afraid the battery life won't be as good for this phone. And I was so wrong. I can easily use this device for two and half days straight without charging it. That includes internet browsing, data using, video and music usage, picture taking and basic calling/texting. Remember still turn off your phone once awhile, it's like a computer, it needs to rest sometime. Anyhow, the only thing that is not too great about this phone is the camera. Don't get me wrong. It takes great and clear pictures. I like the feature that you can choose what to focus when there are multiple things in one frame. The shutter speed sucks. It takes a few seconds for a photo to take a photo. That was pretty disappointing. I did insert a SD card later on and it did help with the speed a little but not too much. But out of all the good things about this phone, I can let one slide. Nothing is perfect right?"
"397413","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact E5823 2GB/32GB 23MP 4.6-inch 4G LTE Factory Unlocked (CORAL RED) - International Stock No Warranty",4,"Purchased on February, now reviewing during August.The Sony Z5 Compact is a great little device with plenty of powerful features.Specs:2GB ramQualcomm Snapdragon 81023 MP Back Camera (wow!)5 MP Front CameraMicro USB Charging Port4.6 inch Touch Screen DisplayIP 68 Waterproof, Dust proof, etc.Micro SD and Nano SIm card slotsReview:Wow!, I'm surprised Sony was able to compact their larger Z5 into such a small body that is convenient for your pocket and your hand. It is truly some remarkable engineering. Well, that compact size does have a drawback that may put some people off which is that it is a blocky/bulky phone. Even though it is a blocky/bulky phone, I always managed to get a nice firm grip because of the size and bulk of the phone. The screen size is perfect in my opinion for the size of this phone which is the same screen size for the iPhone 6/6s. The phone is also waterproof and dustproof which was sort of a minor, yet surprising, thing that Sony would usually put on their phones that is beginning to be used by other phone companies such as Samsung. The Camera packs 23 MP which is quite surprising for the size of the phone. The camera takes good pictures and good videos, HOWEVER, in only good lighting. If you take pictures in the dark, It will appear murky and pixelated. The phone's software experience has been vastly improved from its early beginnings and has lost almost all of its setbacks it had when it started. Sony's android skin is fast and simple, offering a near stock Android Marshmallow experience. The Speakers produce good sound but are located in the most convenient location that most phone companies ignore. The speakers are located in the front with one on top near the camera and one on the bottom. This means you don't cover the speakers when ever you're watching a video in landscape. Most companies put the speakers at the bottom of the phone next to the Micro USB charging port. The biggest grip of the phone is the processor that is encased in it which is the Qualcomm Snapdragon 810. This CPU has a well known record of producing more heat than most of other CPUs in the market. This CPU is very powerful and still relevant even with Qualcomm's new CPU the Snapdragon 820, but it just gets hot very quickly. The heat isn't hot to the touch where it is unbearable it just gets warm when gaming, browsing the web, watching videos, etc. The battery life on this phone is great and it usually has enough charge to last me for a whole day and some the day afterwards. This is, However, if you utilize Sony's STAMINA Battery saver feature. You can still get a whole days worth without it, but you will probably have to cut back on CPU intensive tasks. Overall, this phone offers the strength and speed of its older counterpart(Z5) in a neat little package that doesn't make it uncomfortable in the pocket.Pros:Speed and power( CPU).Small and convenient package.Great front and back cameras.Great battery life.Speaker location is very good and sound great.Waterproof.Cons:CPU gets warm very quicklyCamera quality isn't very good in low light conditions.The thickness of the phone may put off some people.Will Update if necessary."

"397419","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact E5823 2GB/32GB 23MP 4.6-inch 4G LTE Factory Unlocked (CORAL RED) - International Stock No Warranty",4,"First, I want to warn you that I have always loved Sony phones since it was Sony Ericsson. I still remember one of my older phones was a Sony Ericsson K550 that had a 2MP camera but produced pictures with the highest quality. After a disappointment with a Sony Ericsson C901 I decided to switch to Nokia from 2009 until 2013 when I bought a Sony Xperia GO that worked perfectly for 27 months until this November.I decided to buy a Sony Xperia Z5 Compact and after one week I think I can share my experience with all of you.This is a good phone. I know some people would never even consider getting a Sony phone but even they admit Sony is just quality. This phone has an excellent hardware and the way it integrated with the software (Lollipop working perfectly) is what I would call excellence. Connectivity is good since I can connect to 4G (LTE) without any trouble but you need to make sure this phone supports your carrier’s LTE band.Call quality (Let’s remember we still make phone calls with smartphones) is good and I have not had any issues with reception at all. The phone is thick but not as extremely thick as some people have complained. It’s noticeable in your pocket but nothing gross. It’s not heavy or uncomfortable. I have to mention at this point that inserting the SIM card and the memory card is not easy. I swear I’ll never open those slots again. I inserted a 64GB memory card and it’s working flawlessly.The screen delivers beautiful colors and the resolution is excellent. I know some people have complained it could have been better but still is very good. One of the main reasons I love Sony Xperias is because they usually have anti-scratch protection and I witnessed it with my previous Sony Xperia Go as it never got a single scratch in 27 months. The camera has been controversial in some reviews. Look, I know we should believe that smartphones will replace digital cameras but guess what? I don’t think so. The camera takes very good pictures and delivers excellent videos but it’s true it is not perfect. However, the camera is good for most occasions.Sound quality is excellent. I used PowerAMP for my music and this phone has a special feature to improve the overall sound quality with headsets (DSEE HX). It works perfectly and I haven’t had to arrange and tweak the PowerAMP equalizer all over as I did with my previous Sony Xperia GO.Battery life is good but not as other smartphones. If you listen to a lot of music (like me) you’ll need to charge the phone every single day. This is not a problem for me but I know some people might not like it. However, I have to mention that one day I almost didn’t use it and it just discharged from 99% at 7AM to 90% at 7PM so it really depends on usage. Another advantage is that it charges very quickly.The phone is very responsive and I have not experienced any bugs or lags as someone reported before. The camera works pretty well when I click on it taking just one second for the app to open.At this point you must be asking why I’m giving it only 4 stars and I am going to tell you why: heat.Unfortunately, the phone does get warm when you update apps or run another “intensive” process. It’s not all the time so I think Sony has done something maybe not to fix the problem they had before but at least to alleviate it. I want to clarify it gets warm – nothing extreme but still noticeable.This is an excellent phone, really. It’s quality and performance all in one but the heating issue should have been fixed by Sony at this point."

Then this is for you. I may be in a minority but I just don't see the need for phones to be the size that they are right now. I wanted something small enough to operate with one hand and to easily fit in my pocket.My previous phone was an original Moto X and that was a great size for me so I wanted something similar, but all of the OEMs were only producing these massive devices that require two hands to operate. I mean really, how am I supposed to text and drive if I have to take both hands off the wheel? (That's a joke, NEVER text and drive.)So I did tons of research, using the phone comparison feature on sites like gsmarena.com to check the physical dimensions. The other problem was that when I did find a ""small"" phone, it usually had terrible specs. A dumbed down processor from 2 generations ago, not much memory, and often a mediocre camera.Then I found the Sony Xperia Z5 compact. This phone is small but it doesn't skimp on performance. It actually has the same processor as Google's flagship Nexus 6P, so it's blazing fast. Comes with 2GB ram (the 6P has 3GB though I believe) and 32GB built in storage which is easily expanded with an microSD card. Camera is top notch too, being from Sony who has been making cameras and camera lenses for a long time. The other nice thing is the battery life, since it has a good sized battery paired with a smaller screen, the screen actually drains the battery less than on the bigger devices. When I first bought it, I was easily getting 2 days of battery life but now that is more like a day or day and a half depending on my usage.I actually ordered it here unlocked because nobody else is carrying it in the US. When mine arrived, the menus were all in Chinese, but a quick YouTube search showed me how to switch them back to English and I was all set.I'm a big Android fan so I was weary of what kind of bloatware Sony might have installed on this. But it's really not bad at all and feels very similar to a pure android experience. There are a few little things that are different and you can uninstall any of the Sony pre-installed apps without any issue. Mine was also recently OTA'd to Marshmallow which seemed to improve performance quite a bit.Overall, I'm so happy I bought this phone. It's the perfect size if you're looking for a small Android device and has enough processing power to keep up with the latest devices. Oh, the built in fingerprint scanner in the power button is super nice too, as is the physical camera shutter button. Both of these are features I use daily. (Note: I heard that the US spec phones won't have the fingerprint scanner, so be sure to check if that matters to you.)"

I was looking for a multi function (smart) phone not a tablet that also has a phone. For me, bigger is not better. The phone is fast, has enough storage for most people and also that storage can be expanded by up to 100Gb via SD card. After reading the write-ups, I decided that this was the right one. I then had to decide which model, US or International and which vendor. I chose the international model, E5823 because it was a tad lower price but more importantly has the fingerprint reader (left off of the E5803, US model). There were two other criteria - would Sony honor the warranty in the US? Answer from Sony, yes. It may take a couple more days to process, but no warranty issue. Their service center is in Laredo Texas. Also, I wanted to know where I might have to return the phone if it arrived DOA (it didn't). Some vendors require shipping back to Europe or Hong Kong at a cost of $50-$60. No way on that. I chose to buy from CANGURO through Amazon. They are in Chicago and back the product from there. They answered all of my questions. EXCELLENT seller! There is one issue with the phone and it's a software issue. It was not enough for me to downgrade the rating, but might be an issue for you. After upgrading to Android 6.0, Marshmallow, the FM radio freezes after 15-20 minutes. It sometimes requires re-booting the phone to exit the app. Sony has promised a fix."

The phone randomly shuts down once or twice every day! Just from nothing, freezes and restarts. Quite annoying, it takes ~2 minutes... I ve tried what the support team said i should do, but didn't fix the issue. As i bought it without warranty im sticking with a brand new useless phone. Also, this happened to A LOT of people."

"397454","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact E5823 2GB/32GB 23MP 4.6-inch 4G LTE Factory Unlocked (CORAL RED) - International Stock No Warranty",5,"Long story short: this is the phone that finally convinced me to make the jump from Apple's iOS. I had been considering making the jump for some time, but I had yet to find an Android phone that matched the build quality and performance of my iPhone 6S. The z5 Compact finally did convinced me.Pros:+ Same size screen as the iPhone 6S, despite being smaller and lighter.+ Excellent build quality - the phone feels premium, solid and well made. I don't worry about anything breaking if I drop it once or twice.+ Waterproof!+ Very little manufacturer bloatware, especially compared to Samsung or LG. Among other things, this means that future Android updates will hit this phone sooner than many other Android devices.+ I actually most of the bloatware that's included. Sony's launcher is fast and responsive - I'm actually using it instead of the official Google launcher.+ Camera is high quality.+ Better battery life than my iPhone 6s+ Fingerprint scanner+ Plenty of processing power - I haven't yet seen the phone slow down or choke on any app I've thrown at it.Cons:- Cases options for this phone in the U.S. are limited when compared to the dancing plethora of iPhone cases that flood every electronics store, website, gas station and grocery store.- Because this is the international version of the phone, there's no warranty- Because this is the international version of the phone, some apps think I'm in Ireland. I'm sure a simple setting could easily change this, but I haven't yet found it.- Fingerprint scanner doesn't work as well as iPhone 6S (though it's still good). I think this is mainly due to the fact that the scanner is smaller than the iPhone scanner, so it has less to work with.Overall, I've found this phone to be the perfect fit for me. It really hits the sweet spot of combining the power, battery life, screen size and non-bloated OS that I've been looking for."
"397455","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact E5823 2GB/32GB 23MP 4.6-inch 4G LTE Factory Unlocked (CORAL RED) - International Stock No Warranty",1,"The phone is good, stable, small. But when my phone cracked, Sony was really competing with five-ply-a$$wipe on the scale of efficient and successful support. Seriously. If you ever expect that you'll need to call Sony to fix something that might have gone wrong, just get a different device and don't look back."
"397456","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact E5823 2GB/32GB 23MP 4.6-inch 4G LTE Factory Unlocked (CORAL RED) - International Stock No Warranty",5,"This phone is exactly what I was looking for. More compact so I can actually hold and utilize it with one hand, still water proof for random spills and drops in the pool, and great photos!I had a little trouble at first because I forgot all of the little things one must do to get a network unbranded phone to work. Also, if you don't remove the plastic screen protector that comes on it in the box, it will disrupt your ear proximity sensor.Some things you'll have to check if you want full functionality of your phone will be your SMS service center number, APN access point network for Internet and Lte to work, network settings in general. All of this info is available online, so don't be deterred. It's very easy to just type in a couple of numbers and enjoy your new phone."

Compact size without sacrificing CPU and other features like most other ""mini"" phones. I am using this on AT&T in the USA.Pros:- Battery life is astounding. I usually go to bed with ~40% battery after a day of use.- Compact size - so awesome. Hate how big most phones are these days, this is the perfect size for me- Fast. ""Flagship"" phone specs but in a compact size.- Fingerprint scanner. Love this. I hate lock screens but I am required to use them for a few apps, and company policy. Fingerprint scanner works pretty well.- Smart lock - nice feature that is new to me. Auto-unlocks the phone based on certain conditions, such as if certain bluetooth devices are connected, by location (while at home for example) and/or other criteria. Makes having a lock screen much less of a pain.- Dedicated camera button, press and hold to power on the phone and open camera, nice for quick photos- Dual front-facing speakers. Very loud, sound is decent, a bit tinny, but that's expected from such a small device.- Great screen, very clear and bright, no complaints there- Did I mention it's tiny?Cons:- Camera is pretty mediocre. I'm not a big camera user but for some this may be a dealbreaker. My 4 year old HTC One M7 took far better pictures.- Now that I've had it several months, the fingerprint scanner is getting a little glitchy. Most of the time a reboot fixes the problem, but usually comes back after a couple days. Definitely annoying.- Case options are pretty limited, and many of them cover the power button therefore disabling the use of the fingerprint scanner.- 720p resolution. Honestly I don't consider this a downside at all, who wants to watch 1080p video on a 4"" screen anyway. But for some, resolution is important.- Personally I don't like the factory dialer. I almost always dial by number and this one pulls up a list of contacts by default and takes an extra tap to get the keypad. Slightly annoying, but easily fixed with 3rd-party dialers in the Play store.- Gorilla Glass. Hotly debated, but this phone doesn't have it. Sony uses their own proprietary tempered glass, supposedly just as scratch-resistant as Gorilla Glass. I've own the phone for 3 months now and have zero scratches, and survived a couple drops."

From the beginning the phone was a little slow to respond in many ways but I could deal with it. About 3 months ago the camera stopped working entirely. I called customer support and was told to do a soft reset, then hard reset. Neither of those worked.I asked about sending the phone in for repair and was informed that because this model came from Hong Kong, that they could not repair it, it is not covered under warranty, I would have to contact the Hong Kong customer service. I have been back and forth between both Hong Kong and US customer service, both of them just give me the run around and refuse to take responsibility for their faulty product, and will not repair it. After contacting the US customer service again, they advised me to do a software repair. I followed the steps and now my phone is entirely stuck on the beginning intro screen and will not function at all. In other words, right now I paid over $500.00 for a non functioning phone with Sony refusing to fix their faulty product.This phone is a giant lemon, and after dealing with Sonys customer service I will never purchase a Sony product again."

I've only owned Nexi before this, but I find Sony's customizations are almost all additive, like glove mode or being able to reboot or screenshot with a click of the power button. Any uninstallable apps you don't like, just disable in Settings.I use mine without a case and with a lanyard (not included, but I bought some silver ones on Amazon for about $5), which adds no bulk, keeps the phone pure but like a case, offers (preventative) protection against drops. Some have complained about the ""lip"" of the outer frame, but I don't find it remotely bothersome in hand and it protects the glass. It's functional - something any great design must be, not just beautiful. I laugh at all the iPhones wearing ugly cases.I have noticed a couple of intermittent software bugs here & there (example: blacks sometimes look gray when waking from sleep and auto-adjust brightness is on) but nothing I can't live with, and Sony has OTA-air shipped both a firmware and a camera update in the month I've owned the phone.Battery life is great, solidly over a day with moderatly heavy screen-on time use and up to two days with Stamina mode enabled.Just buy it.

I am using the At&t nano sim through straight talk and everything is working just fine.The only downside so far is the camera loads fairly slow.

My music app starts to play by itself out of blue, which gave me couple of embarrassing moments during meetings.Then the screen cracked. Well, that was my fault. I fixed that by spending 170 dollars more on this stupid phone. And then the front camera is broken. Just to make a double down, my text function starts to fail.

The main features I was looking for in a new phone were small size and battery life and I don' think it gets any better than the Z5 compact. My previous phone was a Droid Mini because it was the smallest Android phone available on Verizon. I was hesitant to switch from Verizon because I had been with them for a decade, but I have had no problems so far on AT&T and the Z5 Compact performs great and feels great (much better than the plasticky Droid Mini). In terms of battery life I would take the Mini off of the charger at 7am and with light-average usage it would be dead by 4pm.

There is no other way to put it. It's hands-down the most premium feeling phone I've held - and that's with it swinging against the big guns such as the S6 Edge, HTC One, and iPhone 6.Cons:-I'm not a huge fan of the frosted back, and think it would have looked better with a normal glass back or just a continuation of the excellent plastic used for the sides. This is largely personal preference though.-The volume rocker is in an extremely awkward position. Unlike the Z3 Compact, you really have to work to use it. Would have been better located above the power button.-It comes in Japanese, and it's very difficult to find the language setting. Pull down the notification bar, then again for settings, click the gear, scroll down to the keyboard, then the top setting.Pros:-The fingerprint sensor/power button is fantastic. It's placed perfectly, works fast, and has just the right feel.-Impeccable fit and finish.-Near stock android.-Design.-Specs.-Camera button, which is sadly a dying feature.

This phone is exactly what the iPhone users are hanging onto, a sub 5 inch phone with competitive specs. The 720p resolution is totally fine for the size of the screen. If you feel like it is a big sacrifice, just remember it improves the battery life (up to 2 days). The camera is pretty amazing and the expandable memory (micro sd) is also a breath of fresh air coming from an iPhone.

"397501","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact E5823 2GB/32GB 23MP 4.6-inch 4G LTE Factory Unlocked (WHITE) - International Stock No Warranty",5,"This is a fantastic phone.Sony did an excellent job with the user environment. It's only a little customised from stock Android and isn't always trying to sell you stuff like a Samsung device. The bloatware isn't too bad either and can be disabled. Sony includes a free service to locate, lock, or wipe your lost phone. Also software to copy over your old data. Very useful.Battery life really is good. My first day, it lasted until night which is quite good doing all of the setup and playing around. Under normal usage I have about 40% left at the end of the day--Wow! STAMINA mode seems really usable too for special times when you need extra battery life.The phone is small and very portable. It's not wafer thin, probably because of a larger battery. I don't find the thickness to be too much. Of course, with the smaller size you get a smaller screen. Is it worth the trade-off? Only you can decide.Performance is fast and flawless, which is unparalleled in a small phone. It doesn't seem to get particularly hot.The screen looks beautiful and the pixel density is plenty.I love the fingerprint sensor! Works great and so conveniently located. It's a shame they couldn't include this feature on the US model. I had Android encrypt the device for security, no problems.Volume control buttons seemed oddly placed at first, but they are out of the way and how often do you use them? Not that much.Camera, although it could be improved, is very usable as a compact camera. Dedicated camera button is very nice. Picture quality good, shutter delay fair.Water and dust sealing should be on EVERY phone. Great how it doesn't have fiddly flaps to cover all the ports.Audio quality is excellent and seems better than my old Samsung phone.No US warranty is unfortunate. If it breaks, I plan to pay for any repairs. I can live with the risk as a trade-off for the fingerprint scanner.Earbuds were included; thank you, Sony.Included charger had the international prong setup and included adapter for US outlets. Works fine, I have other chargers that work just as fine. Sometime I'll probably pick up a Quick Charge 2.0 charger.Overall, a super package! I'm so happy with it."

Button layout is perfect for one hand use. Bezel space is small, front stereo speakers are cool.Software wise... This phone is a joke. I had low expectations going in but was surprised at how bad it really is. The camera sucks, theres no way to say it's good at anything. Stereo speakers on front aren't same volume so it's a rather odd sound when viewing videos. Luminosity of auto brightness is all over the place, all of the time. And then there's overheating. The 810 in here should have been called dragons breath because it leaves the phone inoperable at times. I haven't shot 4k video or even played games yet and it gets above 170 just browsing the web. Charging the phone gets it to about 140 also.. and if you get a phone call or have to actually touch the phone, you get burned.All in all,if you're not a heavy user or you are coming from an iPhone, you'll probably like it. Otherwise I wouldn't recommend it."

Also, if you don't remove the plastic screen protector that comes on it in the box, it will disrupt your ear proximity sensor.Some things you'll have to check if you want full functionality of your phone will be your SMS service center number, APN access point network for Internet and Lte to work, network settings in general.

Compact size without sacrificing CPU and other features like most other ""mini"" phones. I am using this on AT&T in the USA.Pros:- Battery life is astounding. I usually go to bed with ~40% battery after a day of use.- Compact size - so awesome. Hate how big most phones are these days, this is the perfect size for me- Fast. ""Flagship"" phone specs but in a compact size.- Fingerprint scanner. Love this. I hate lock screens but I am required to use them for a few apps, and company policy. Fingerprint scanner works pretty well.- Smart lock - nice feature that is new to me. Auto-unlocks the phone based on certain conditions, such as if certain bluetooth devices are connected, by location (while at home for example) and/or other criteria. Makes having a lock screen much less of a pain.- Dedicated camera button, press and hold to power on the phone and open camera, nice for quick photos- Dual front-facing speakers. Very loud, sound is decent, a bit tinny, but that's expected from such a small device.- Great screen, very clear and bright, no complaints there- Did I mention it's tiny?Cons:- Camera is pretty mediocre. I'm not a big camera user but for some this may be a dealbreaker. My 4 year old HTC One M7 took far better pictures.- Now that I've had it several months, the fingerprint scanner is getting a little glitchy. Most of the time a reboot fixes the problem, but usually comes back after a couple days. Definitely annoying.- Case options are pretty limited, and many of them cover the power button therefore disabling the use of the fingerprint scanner.- 720p resolution. Honestly I don't consider this a downside at all, who wants to watch 1080p video on a 4"" screen anyway. But for some, resolution is important.- Personally I don't like the factory dialer. I almost always dial by number and this one pulls up a list of contacts by default and takes an extra tap to get the keypad. Slightly annoying, but easily fixed with 3rd-party dialers in the Play store.- Gorilla Glass. Hotly debated, but this phone doesn't have it. Sony uses their own proprietary tempered glass, supposedly just as scratch-resistant as Gorilla Glass. I've own the phone for 3 months now and have zero scratches, and survived a couple drops."

From the beginning the phone was a little slow to respond in many ways but I could deal with it. About 3 months ago the camera stopped working entirely. I called customer support and was told to do a soft reset, then hard reset. Neither of those worked.I asked about sending the phone in for repair and was informed that because this model came from Hong Kong, that they could not repair it, it is not covered under warranty, I would have to contact the Hong Kong customer service. I have been back and forth between both Hong Kong and US customer service, both of them just give me the run around and refuse to take responsibility for their faulty product, and will not repair it. After contacting the US customer service again, they advised me to do a software repair. I followed the steps and now my phone is entirely stuck on the beginning intro screen and will not function at all. In other words, right now I paid over $500.00 for a non functioning phone with Sony refusing to fix their faulty product.This phone is a giant lemon, and after dealing with Sonys customer service I will never purchase a Sony product again."

I've only owned Nexi before this, but I find Sony's customizations are almost all additive, like glove mode or being able to reboot or screenshot with a click of the power button. Any uninstallable apps you don't like, just disable in Settings.I use mine without a case and with a lanyard (not included, but I bought some silver ones on Amazon for about $5), which adds no bulk, keeps the phone pure but like a case, offers (preventative) protection against drops. Some have complained about the ""lip"" of the outer frame, but I don't find it remotely bothersome in hand and it protects the glass. It's functional - something any great design must be, not just beautiful. I laugh at all the iPhones wearing ugly cases.I have noticed a couple of intermittent software bugs here & there (example: blacks sometimes look gray when waking from sleep and auto-adjust brightness is on) but nothing I can't live with, and Sony has OTA-air shipped both a firmware and a camera update in the month I've owned the phone.Battery life is great, solidly over a day with moderatly heavy screen-on time use and up to two days with Stamina mode enabled.Just buy it.

As a consumer, I'm incredibly attentive to the small details in a product, and if the issue is annoying enough, I'll return it. Not so with the Xperia Z5 Compact (Z5c from here on). In more detail below:DISPLAY:Stunning LCD with virtually no light bleed. Colors are well saturated, and almost approach AMOLED in the level of depth. Whites are accurate, and text overall is sharp. I prefer AMOLED for the true blacks, but this is a very solid LCD. If I had one complaint, it's that the circuitry is sometimes visible in bright light behind the display.DESIGN:The phone fits in the hand very well. The sides are very easy to grip on to, and the frosted finish on the back glass is a huge improvement over the previous Xperia devices. The fingerprint scanner on the power button is extremely accurate and fast. I would have placed the volume button a bit higher than Sony did, however. I haven't tested the waterproofing, but it's a useful feature to have.PERFORMANCE:I was concerned at first about the Snapdragon 810 in the device, and heat issues, but so far, I haven't felt any extreme heating. It does definitely get warm during use, but no more than say, a Samsung Galaxy S6. It's very fast, and for gaming, the 720p display serves it well. Some users have reported performance issues or lagging through the UI, particularly when an SD card is inserted, though I've not noticed any of these. I also have had no issues with streaming Bluetooth audio.BATTERY:I don't think this device will last 2 days on a single charge, though it absolutely can get through a single day's use. I spend roughly half of my day in a low signal area, which I expect would affect this, and thus, lower the battery life. In a stronger signal environment, it would probably last longer.CAMERA:The camera is excellent. The photos are crisp, and sharp on most subjects. Low-light performance could be better, but I have no real complaints with the camera.MISC:It doesn't support Wi-Fi calling, or VoLTE on T-Mobile, though I doubt this can be helped, considering it's an international model.Overall, this is the best option if you're looking for a compact Android device. I'm certainly keeping it."

"397526","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact E5823 2GB/32GB 23MP 4.6-inch 4G LTE Factory Unlocked (WHITE) - International Stock No Warranty",1,"I bought this phone as a replacement for my Z1 which I had for over two and half years. I had zero issues with it until I shattered the screen. The Xperia line of phones are touted as being waterproof or at least they were initially. Sony seems to have shied away from that position now and for good reason. You see, I originally bought the Z1 for three main reasons: the 20mp camera, water resistance, build quality. My experience with the Z1 lead me to believe that the Z5c would be a suitable replacement. I assumed that the Z5c would certainly exceed the standards set by the Z1. I was wrong.Firstly, the positives1) The camera of the Z5c does outperform the Z1's especially in low light conditions. The overall picture quality is only slightly better, however.2) The UI is smoother and faster, likely due to the more powerful CPU3) Slightly better battery life4) Twice the storage capacity5) No flap cover for the USB slot6) Louder speakersThe negatives1) Plastic frame. The phone feels cheap compared to the Z1. It also is less damage resistant than the metal Z12) Frosted glass back plate. While it looks nice, it makes the phone slick and therefore harder to hold3) Build quality and water resistanceI assumed that the Z5c would be even more watertight than the Z1 since it has a higher IP certification. Nope. Even though I swam with my Z1 dozens of times, occasionally exceeding its depth rating, I never once had any issues. I would even wash it in the sink weekly. The phone was waterproof until I broke the screen. The Z5c, on the other hand, died the very moment it touched water. It was thoroughly waterlogged as if it lacked a water resistant seal entirely.Sony's repair service only made matters worse. They claimed that my Z5c was made for the Polish market (what?) and that there are no repair centers in the US. I was given an address in England to ship it and they said they would pay for Royal Mail shipping. Naturally, they could not seeing as how there are no Royal Mail offices in the US. Despite paying for shipping, Sony fixed the phone free of charge since it was under warranty. The turn around time was a bit over a month. I believe I got lucky as I have read that Sony will not honor warranty claims that are the result of water damage.So I go to turn the phone on and all seems well. At this point, I'm just glad to finally have my phone back. However, to my dismay the volume key does not work. They replaced the screen along with many internal components and performed a diagnostics test and yet somehow the broken volume key passed the test. What the heck. Every Xperia phone lets you run a simple pass/fail diagnostic test in the settings menu. One of the tests is for the volume rocker key. I don't understand how they missed this.I reached out to Sony again who said to ship the phone to them. And so I did. Over three weeks went by before I asked them for a status update. They told me they did not receive my phone. Strange. USPS stated that it passed customs and marked it as delivered. A couple more weeks go by before I receive an international package at my door. I thought maybe they had fixed my phone without notifying me. A foolish thought. What happened was that the Sony Service Center refused to take possession of the package so it was returned to me. Apparently there was a customs fee that they would not pay, despite stating that they would pay for shipping both ways. Since I paid for shipping to them both times they could have at least paid the measly fee. Why would Sony pays for it the first time but not the second? I asked USPS if I could pay the fee upfront and I was told I cannot.I've had it with Sony. Clearly the quality of their phones isn't what it used to be, not to mention the quality of their customer service. I'll update this review if Sony rectifies the situation. Don't hold your breath though."

Fits well into any pocket, including women's jeans! (This was a problem for me with larger phones.) Fingerprint scanner is a great feature and the camera is great; I haven't tested how waterproof it is yet, but it's nice to not worry about it in rain etc. Software all runs smoothly and I have yet to come up on anything the phone struggles to do.Rated down by 1 star as it tends to heat up and drain battery relatively quickly, though. It's excellent in 60º (F) weather where the air temp naturally compensates, but as it gets up to 80s or 90s the battery just burns up if you're using the screen a lot."

So I had this phone for about a month now and I gotta say I'm very pleased with it. The display is so beautiful and the clarity is high. Even on low brightness. I thought the screen might be too small for me but it's perfect. I have small hands myself. Now I don't have to stretch my thumb across the screen to text messages. I can text comfortably with one hand. The battery life is just AWESOME!!!! Coming from a MOTO X that could barely last one day, I was afraid the battery life won't be as good for this phone. And I was so wrong. I can easily use this device for two and half days straight without charging it. That includes internet browsing, data using, video and music usage, picture taking and basic calling/texting. Remember still turn off your phone once awhile, it's like a computer, it needs to rest sometime. Anyhow, the only thing that is not too great about this phone is the camera. Don't get me wrong. It takes great and clear pictures. I like the feature that you can choose what to focus when there are multiple things in one frame. The shutter speed sucks. It takes a few seconds for a photo to take a photo. That was pretty disappointing. I did insert a SD card later on and it did help with the speed a little but not too much. But out of all the good things about this phone, I can let one slide. Nothing is perfect right?"
"397533","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact E5823 2GB/32GB 23MP 4.6-inch 4G LTE Factory Unlocked (WHITE) - International Stock No Warranty",4,"Purchased on February, now reviewing during August.The Sony Z5 Compact is a great little device with plenty of powerful features.Specs:2GB ramQualcomm Snapdragon 81023 MP Back Camera (wow!)5 MP Front CameraMicro USB Charging Port4.6 inch Touch Screen DisplayIP 68 Waterproof, Dust proof, etc.Micro SD and Nano SIm card slotsReview:Wow!, I'm surprised Sony was able to compact their larger Z5 into such a small body that is convenient for your pocket and your hand. It is truly some remarkable engineering. Well, that compact size does have a drawback that may put some people off which is that it is a blocky/bulky phone. Even though it is a blocky/bulky phone, I always managed to get a nice firm grip because of the size and bulk of the phone. The screen size is perfect in my opinion for the size of this phone which is the same screen size for the iPhone 6/6s. The phone is also waterproof and dustproof which was sort of a minor, yet surprising, thing that Sony would usually put on their phones that is beginning to be used by other phone companies such as Samsung. The Camera packs 23 MP which is quite surprising for the size of the phone. The camera takes good pictures and good videos, HOWEVER, in only good lighting. If you take pictures in the dark, It will appear murky and pixelated. The phone's software experience has been vastly improved from its early beginnings and has lost almost all of its setbacks it had when it started. Sony's android skin is fast and simple, offering a near stock Android Marshmallow experience. The Speakers produce good sound but are located in the most convenient location that most phone companies ignore. The speakers are located in the front with one on top near the camera and one on the bottom. This means you don't cover the speakers when ever you're watching a video in landscape. Most companies put the speakers at the bottom of the phone next to the Micro USB charging port. The biggest grip of the phone is the processor that is encased in it which is the Qualcomm Snapdragon 810. This CPU has a well known record of producing more heat than most of other CPUs in the market. This CPU is very powerful and still relevant even with Qualcomm's new CPU the Snapdragon 820, but it just gets hot very quickly. The heat isn't hot to the touch where it is unbearable it just gets warm when gaming, browsing the web, watching videos, etc. The battery life on this phone is great and it usually has enough charge to last me for a whole day and some the day afterwards. This is, However, if you utilize Sony's STAMINA Battery saver feature. You can still get a whole days worth without it, but you will probably have to cut back on CPU intensive tasks. Overall, this phone offers the strength and speed of its older counterpart(Z5) in a neat little package that doesn't make it uncomfortable in the pocket.Pros:Speed and power( CPU).Small and convenient package.Great front and back cameras.Great battery life.Speaker location is very good and sound great.Waterproof.Cons:CPU gets warm very quicklyCamera quality isn't very good in low light conditions.The thickness of the phone may put off some people.Will Update if necessary."

"397539","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact E5823 2GB/32GB 23MP 4.6-inch 4G LTE Factory Unlocked (WHITE) - International Stock No Warranty",4,"First, I want to warn you that I have always loved Sony phones since it was Sony Ericsson. I still remember one of my older phones was a Sony Ericsson K550 that had a 2MP camera but produced pictures with the highest quality. After a disappointment with a Sony Ericsson C901 I decided to switch to Nokia from 2009 until 2013 when I bought a Sony Xperia GO that worked perfectly for 27 months until this November.I decided to buy a Sony Xperia Z5 Compact and after one week I think I can share my experience with all of you.This is a good phone. I know some people would never even consider getting a Sony phone but even they admit Sony is just quality. This phone has an excellent hardware and the way it integrated with the software (Lollipop working perfectly) is what I would call excellence. Connectivity is good since I can connect to 4G (LTE) without any trouble but you need to make sure this phone supports your carrier’s LTE band.Call quality (Let’s remember we still make phone calls with smartphones) is good and I have not had any issues with reception at all. The phone is thick but not as extremely thick as some people have complained. It’s noticeable in your pocket but nothing gross. It’s not heavy or uncomfortable. I have to mention at this point that inserting the SIM card and the memory card is not easy. I swear I’ll never open those slots again. I inserted a 64GB memory card and it’s working flawlessly.The screen delivers beautiful colors and the resolution is excellent. I know some people have complained it could have been better but still is very good. One of the main reasons I love Sony Xperias is because they usually have anti-scratch protection and I witnessed it with my previous Sony Xperia Go as it never got a single scratch in 27 months. The camera has been controversial in some reviews. Look, I know we should believe that smartphones will replace digital cameras but guess what? I don’t think so. The camera takes very good pictures and delivers excellent videos but it’s true it is not perfect. However, the camera is good for most occasions.Sound quality is excellent. I used PowerAMP for my music and this phone has a special feature to improve the overall sound quality with headsets (DSEE HX). It works perfectly and I haven’t had to arrange and tweak the PowerAMP equalizer all over as I did with my previous Sony Xperia GO.Battery life is good but not as other smartphones. If you listen to a lot of music (like me) you’ll need to charge the phone every single day. This is not a problem for me but I know some people might not like it. However, I have to mention that one day I almost didn’t use it and it just discharged from 99% at 7AM to 90% at 7PM so it really depends on usage. Another advantage is that it charges very quickly.The phone is very responsive and I have not experienced any bugs or lags as someone reported before. The camera works pretty well when I click on it taking just one second for the app to open.At this point you must be asking why I’m giving it only 4 stars and I am going to tell you why: heat.Unfortunately, the phone does get warm when you update apps or run another “intensive” process. It’s not all the time so I think Sony has done something maybe not to fix the problem they had before but at least to alleviate it. I want to clarify it gets warm – nothing extreme but still noticeable.This is an excellent phone, really. It’s quality and performance all in one but the heating issue should have been fixed by Sony at this point."

I was looking for a multi function (smart) phone not a tablet that also has a phone. For me, bigger is not better. The phone is fast, has enough storage for most people and also that storage can be expanded by up to 100Gb via SD card. After reading the write-ups, I decided that this was the right one. I then had to decide which model, US or International and which vendor. I chose the international model, E5823 because it was a tad lower price but more importantly has the fingerprint reader (left off of the E5803, US model). There were two other criteria - would Sony honor the warranty in the US? Answer from Sony, yes. It may take a couple more days to process, but no warranty issue. Their service center is in Laredo Texas. Also, I wanted to know where I might have to return the phone if it arrived DOA (it didn't). Some vendors require shipping back to Europe or Hong Kong at a cost of $50-$60. No way on that. I chose to buy from CANGURO through Amazon. They are in Chicago and back the product from there. They answered all of my questions. EXCELLENT seller! There is one issue with the phone and it's a software issue. It was not enough for me to downgrade the rating, but might be an issue for you. After upgrading to Android 6.0, Marshmallow, the FM radio freezes after 15-20 minutes. It sometimes requires re-booting the phone to exit the app. Sony has promised a fix."

I had been considering making the jump for some time, but I had yet to find an Android phone that matched the build quality and performance of my iPhone 6S. The z5 Compact finally did convinced me.Pros:+ Same size screen as the iPhone 6S, despite being smaller and lighter.+ Excellent build quality - the phone feels premium, solid and well made. I don't worry about anything breaking if I drop it once or twice.+ Waterproof!+ Very little manufacturer bloatware, especially compared to Samsung or LG. Among other things, this means that future Android updates will hit this phone sooner than many other Android devices.+ I actually most of the bloatware that's included. Sony's launcher is fast and responsive - I'm actually using it instead of the official Google launcher.+ Camera is high quality.+ Better battery life than my iPhone 6s+ Fingerprint scanner+ Plenty of processing power - I haven't yet seen the phone slow down or choke on any app I've thrown at it.Cons:- Cases options for this phone in the U.S. are limited when compared to the dancing plethora of iPhone cases that flood every electronics store, website, gas station and grocery store.- Because this is the international version of the phone, there's no warranty- Because this is the international version of the phone, some apps think I'm in Ireland. I'm sure a simple setting could easily change this, but I haven't yet found it.- Fingerprint scanner doesn't work as well as iPhone 6S (though it's still good). I think this is mainly due to the fact that the scanner is smaller than the iPhone scanner, so it has less to work with.Overall, I've found this phone to be the perfect fit for me. It really hits the sweet spot of combining the power, battery life, screen size and non-bloated OS that I've been looking for."

"397567","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact E5823 2GB/32GB 23MP 4.6-inch 4G LTE Factory Unlocked (WHITE) - International Stock No Warranty",3,"I agree with most of the other reviews that state that this is a great reasonably sized phone. Since they already detail the good parts, I'll spare you the extra words.That said, its battery life, size, and camera quality are marred by mediocre Bluetooth performance, camera app unresponsiveness, and poor stability.I've noticed Bluetooth audio with aptX can stutter. While it only happens twice in the included demo video (at 0:44 and 1:10), it can happen rather frequently if there's a lot going on in the background. It's very distracting whenever it happens. I strongly believe that the issue lies with the Z5C's aptX codec:* The headphones in question are the Plantronics BackBeat PRO Wireless Noise Canceling Hi-Fi Headphones with Mic - Compatible with iPhone, iPad, Android, and Other Smart Devices. In my testing, they work fine on the Nexus 4 and OnePlus One (Android phones that *don't* support aptX), and on an iPad and MacBook Pro (Apple devices that *do* support aptX).* Additionally, all of the non-aptX receivers I've tried with this phone work fine. As of this writing, this includes the Amazon Echo, Honda CR-V HandsFreeLink, JayBird BBX1MB BlueBuds X Sport Bluetooth Headphones - Black (Discontinued by Manufacturer), and the HomeSpot NFC-Enabled Bluetooth Audio Receiver for Sound System.Despite the inclusion of a Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 in the phone, it's not very responsive. While taking a video, the camera app appears to stutter and drop a few frames every few seconds. It can be very difficult to stop taking a video - the phone will appear to still be capturing frames, but pressing the stop button can occasionally do nothing. Once the phone is in this state, nothing on the screen will respond including the back, home, and task switcher buttons (even though the camera still updates as you move the phone around). The only way out is to hard reboot (which can take up to three minutes if you have device encryption enabled). If you close the camera using the home button or the task switcher, the rest of the phone becomes very slow until you reopen the camera and close it using the back button.As for stability, I'll just leave the text of my initial 1-star review here:After successfully using this phone for navigation, I put it back in my pocket. When I took it out an hour later, it wouldn't turn back on. I could tell it wasn't a suddenly dead battery because the phone vibrated whenever I put my finger on the fingerprint sensor. I tried a hard reboot by removing and replacing the SIM card and the phone has been unresponsive since then.This is a real shame especially because there are no other decent phones on the market at this form factor (except maybe the Z3 Compact, which I've seen run into the exact same problem).Eventually I figured out that the problem was because Android crashed pretty hard since pressing and holding the ""OFF"" button hidden behind the SIM/SD cover brought the phone back to a working state."
"397568","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact E5823 2GB/32GB 23MP 4.6-inch 4G LTE Factory Unlocked (WHITE) - International Stock No Warranty",5,"I got to say after 5 days of use, I absolutely love this phone. The small compact size is perfect for me and I don't mind the thickness, I assume it's thicker than most to put that bigger battery in. I thought it would be hard to go small since I'm coming from the iPhone 6 Plus, but wasn't bad at all in my opinion. This is actually the first android phone that I can say I won't be going back to my iPhone. I get about 1 1/2 days of battery life at moderate use. so far my screen on time averages 4 hours, best was 4 hours 45 minutes. My last android phone was the 2015 moto x pure and that battery life was horrible along with others I have owned, nexus 5x, Htc one m7, m8, m9, nexus 5, and so on which always made me go back to my iPhone along with other reasons. I am in the United States and with At&t and can confirm LTE works perfectly. No issues at all. Also I didn't have to manually put in the APN for mms or Internet to work, u just make sure u have wifi connected and then go to settings, then more, then scroll down and hit internet settings. Hit download and it will automatically download the correct settings for your carrier, make sure your carrier sim is installed. The camera is good enough for me, I'm no professional photographer so I just leave it in superior auto mode and it takes good pics in my opinion. I can confirm the phone back does get a little warm during some situations. First one was downloading all my apps from the play store at the same time. 2nd is using hangouts for video calls, other than that it has been fine. The heat it did get did not burn my hand and was still comfortable to hold and use. I did get the DP glass screen protector which I put on all my phones and I like it. I'm not a case kind of guy so waiting on my dbrand skin. I did get the white version and I have not had any screen issues or my on screen buttons not working on my bed. I assume others just got a defective unit. I got usb cord, earbuds, and a international plug in the box. Just a side not I only have one hand and am super happy that a company actually makes a one handed device with great specs. Most android phones I've had one handed use was very difficult if not impossible but had no choice if wanted top specs, so thank you Sony for high end specs in a compact size."

It is not as compact as the Z5c, meaning Sony is still the only name in the game but the A9 is still manageable. You can read my review here: https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B017D554UKI have been through every phone you can imagine and the Sony Xperia Compact line continues to impress me. I recently had a Nexus 6p and Nexus 5x and the sizes are just to much for me. Yes, I really want Marshmallow but can wait an extra few weeks for it. I asked a few questions before buying and had trouble getting clear information due to the technical nature, but wanted to clarify for those who are looking.This phone is almost fully compatible with T-Mobile USA and I can confirm Band 12 (Extended Range LTE) *does* work (confirmed with LTE Discovery). However, there is no HD Voice, VoLTE or WiFi Calling. For me, these trade-offs were well worth it because of the phenomenal battery life (which will likely get better on Marshmallow), the compact form factor and water resistance (just nice to have as a backup). If WiFi calling is an issue for you, you can use something like Hangouts phone calls as a backup. It is of course not as convenient, but it works. HD Voice is only compatible T-Mobile <> T-Mobile and, yes, you can tell the difference and I wish I had it - but again, not a huge trade-off. VoLTE is the one that gets me. For those of you that don't know, this means the phone drops your data down to 3G/HSPA when making a phone call. Not the end of the world but you may notice the difference when navigating, tethering to your PC, trying to navigate, etc. Again, you could get around this by using a third-party dialer (Hangouts) since that is a VoIP call but for most people, this may be overkill. I suspect though most people buying this phone are pretty familiar with these things since the phone is not advertised in the US. The lack of VoLTE/WiFi Calling/HD Voice is the only reason I knocked off a star.Note the phone comes with an international charger and adapter. It is compatible with QuickCharge technology and charges rapidly for example with this Swiftrans 3221263 Quick Charge 2.0 36W Dual Ports USB Car ChargerThe camera on the phone is pretty good - not the best - but will be fine for 9/10 people.I am using the phone with Aomax® For Sony Xperia Z5 Compact / Mini Tempered Glass Screen Protector [Superslim 0.26mm,2.5D Round Edge,9H Hardness] [Retail Package] For(Sony Xperia Z5 Compact / Mini) and Orzly® - FlexiSlim Case for SONY XPERIA Z5 COMPACT (2015 SmartPhone Model / Smallest Version / XPERIA Z5 MINI) - Super Slim (0.35mm) Protective Phone Cover in Semi Transparent WHITE. It was important to me I protected the device but didn't go overboard on the bulkiness - the combination of these two are perfect. I have reviewed each of these independently but included one picture here of the phone, glass and case together.Overall this is an awesome phone for people who aren't concerned about buying direct from a carrier and don't want a huge phone."

"397579","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact E5823 2GB/32GB 23MP 4.6-inch 4G LTE Factory Unlocked (WHITE) - International Stock No Warranty",5,"An amazing phone! If you are in the US be prepared to run into small workable issues. I use AT&T and the company was great in supporting the unlocked phone, setting me up with a visit to the distribution office for the Nano-sim install and activation. The issues I am talking about is the distribution centers have no experience with this phone and had no idea how to move the data from my old Samsung Rugby (smart phone version) to the new phone, how to install the Nano Sim or the SD card. Since AT&T will not allow two phones to be active at the same time I could not download the Xperia App to the old phone --- you must do this prior to deactivating the old sim --- via Google play, a similar app is needed for Bluetooth transfer --- the only option to find and buy the Xperia data cable and try that. For those reading this and are thinking that all I have to do is to remove the SD card from the old Samsung Rugby which is also an Android device with all the latest updates. It doesn’t work, the Xperia Z5 compact rejected the phone contacts as not being in the right format. What the heck? The Samsung Rugby (smart phone version) does not use the *.vcf format and will not transfer to the Xperia.Even if I have to transfer all my contacts to my new Xperia Z5 Compact manually I’m willing to do so. This phone supports amazingly clear conversations using Bluetooth headset, speaker-phone, or near the face, the camera is outstanding. Even though there are complaints of the 780 display I don’t see it. I am very happy with a phone that is not tethered to a charging dock every few hours. I have to ask, if wireless means you are not connected to an RJ jack but are tethered to a charger all the time what is the difference? Bonus, with the reasonable screen size I do not have to hire a porter and baggage cart to haul it around, it fits into my pocket, imagine that!"

This phone is built really well, looks sharp and is the perfect size.The phone is speedy, all wireless connections are sturdy and I love Sony's Android Skin."
"397581","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact E5823 2GB/32GB 23MP 4.6-inch 4G LTE Factory Unlocked (WHITE) - International Stock No Warranty",3,"TL;DR PRO/CON list at bottom.I will start off this review by saying that I really wanted to love this phone. It does have some very good qualities about it. But the phone has its faults, which are enough for me to not give this phone a recommendation. I have used the phone for approximately 6 months.By background is that I worked in the cell phone industry selling phones for years, before moving into corporate IT and networking. I have been a amateur phone enthusiast and have easily had over 30 phones in my day. I also take exceptional care of my belongings, electronics getting special care. Seeing as this phone is a bit expensive for the size, it was a bit of a treat for myself as the specs and design looked like everything I wanted.HardwareScreen is a nice size for one handed use. Is very crisp and easy to see inside and outside in bright sunlight. Physical buttons are a tad awkward being so low on the device, but worked well for how I hold a phone. They provide enough click, but are a little hard to ""feel out"" and press during a call. Volume on the dual speakers is adequate for a small phone and produce decent sound. Sound through earphones is very good. 2 GB of RAM is more than enough to power the 720p screen and the 810 processor never lets up. The fingerprint scanner is top notch. Works very fast and recognizes fingers well. It allows 5 fingers to be registered. I did my wife's thumb, left index, right index, and my right thumb twice for better accuracy on my main digit. Sometimes I would pull the phone out of my pocket and it would already have registered my thumb and unlocked itself.UI, Performance, and Battery LifeThis phone came with Android Lollipop and is now updated to Marshmallow. The UI runs well. The fast processor and 2 GB of RAM don't let this phone slow down much if at all. Sony's take on Android is a very clean and minimal. Although there is plenty of Sony ""bloatware"" apps that come preinstalled and cannot be removed. You can ""disable"" them so they are no longer active and don't appear in the menu, but still live on the device. The Snapdragon 810 does still tend to get hot at random times. An app may be running in the background and you can feel the phone get much warmer. Never hot that you feel in danger, but warm enough to warranty a reboot in my opinion. Once back up the device was cool again. Battery life on the phone is decent, but not close to the expectation that Sony has set with previous devices in the series. It will get you through a day easily with moderate to heavy use, and can easily stretch to two days with light use. Recharge time however is very long. If you plug into a PC to charge expect at least 3 - 4 hours to charge it up. A quick charge adapter is a wise investment if you get this phone.Apps and GamingI largely got this phone for remote play on the PS4; that feature worked wonderfully with no issues. While the small screen was a little hard to see at times, I never had an issue with pairing the PS4 controller via bluetooth or playing over WiFi. The stock messaging app always gave me trouble with MMS messages, even with the correct settings from AT&T. I constantly got a you have an MMS to download message even though I already read the message. Textra fixed that issue and is a much better messaging app in my opinion. I don't really play any other types of mobile games, but companion apps for Destiny, Metal Gear Solid V, and standard apps like The Weather Channel all ran great on the device. As mentioned before there is A LOT of Sony branded items that are just flat out annoying and not needed.CameraWonderful camera. Loved to take pictures with this phone. They almost always come out clear and sharp. With the latest updates the camera opens quickly. The phone does a good job of fast auto-focus as promised. The shutter key on the side of the device is great for open the camera quickly and nice to take a picture. Finger placement while holding the phone is a bit awkward as the camera is very close the the top edge of the phone and gets covered easy if you are not careful. I spent most of my time in superior auto mode which produces 8 mp images. Going into manual will give you an overwhelming amount of options and allow full 23 mp pictures.DesignLooking at the phone it screams premium. Add waterproofing to the device and that is just piece of mind that some rain or accidental spills will not harm the device. No flap for the charge port is also wonderful as I've seen my share of them get damaged on phone such as the Galaxy S5 which kills the waterproofing of the device. The phone has a heafty weight to it that also feels good. The frosted glass back looks very nice and does not attract fingerprints. The phone is very slippery. On a scale of 1 to 10 with 1 being course grit sand paper and 10 being metal coated in Teflon covered in olive oil, this phone is a 9 easy. The phone literally wants to slide out of your hand whenever you hold it. If nothing else a case is needed to provide some grip to the phone. Having a glass front and back also made me extra cautious and nervous about potential cracks. But I have always taken care of my devices and never cracked a screen.Phone callsPhone calls on the device were clean on my end every time. There were issues for the other caller especially when I used speaker phone. Callers would often complain that they heard themselves or that they could not hear me until I went back to the earpiece. It also appeared that using the speaker phone only used the bottom speaker and not both.DurabilityThis phone is by its very nature fragile. With over 90% of the outer casing being glass, you better believe this baby is delicate. The phone came with a pre-installed screen protector, but it became cruddy very fast. I normally don't use a screen protector and have never had an issue. I somehow managed to put a small scratch on the screen while it was in my pocket with NOTHING else in it one day while hiking. It was no big deal, as I couldn't see it when the screen was on, but I knew it was there and worried me that it got damaged so easily. Now just recently a friend placed my phone near a counter edge, and a got a few messages in a row that made the device vibrate right off the edge. Of course it landed face down on kitchen tile. Screen completely shattered and the touch screen stopped functioning altogether. I am not knocking this phone because of my stupid mistake, not many phones if any would survive a fall like that. Instead it just goes to show that a rugged case is just about required for this device. Which is a huge bummer since the phone looks so good.TL;DR and PROS/CONS ListPROS-- Nice screen for a smaller phone-- Beautiful design-- Great camera-- Fast performance-- Sony's UI has a good design-- Waterproof-- Native PS4 remote playCons-- Sony bloatware that cannot be removed, just disabled-- Slippery-- Fragile-- Poor speaker phone quality for the other caller-- Awkward button placement-- Very slow charge time-- Expensive-- Sony is slow to update UIConclusion and thoughtsThe phone is not worth the price. The camera is very nice and waterproofing is a big plus, but a few nice features do not outweigh the fact you are terrified to accidentally drop such an expensive phone. If you don't let anyone else touch this phone, and put it in a really hard-core case, it may last you a good while. If you live in the real world where you may leave you phone on a desk, give it to someone to take a picture of you, or bump into something with the phone in your pocket it may be dropped and will break."

I then took the phone to a nearby AT&T store to have them install a nano-SIM card. In 10 minutes this process was completed without any issues. It connected to the AT&T network in my home state of NY. So far, I'm very happy with this phone."

I loved my Sony ZL phone, got it wet so then went to the Z1 which is great but too big and heavy for me. This is the best phone out there for my needs right now and I believe this size of phone will make a huge comeback as it is truly ideal, great job Sony! (PS I am on T-Mobile and I don't think I am getting LTE but still quite fast and battery drain is not an issue)"
"397596","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact E5823 2GB/32GB 23MP 4.6-inch 4G LTE Factory Unlocked (WHITE) - International Stock No Warranty",5,"Looking for a small sized phone that packs a lot of power? Then this is for you. I may be in a minority but I just don't see the need for phones to be the size that they are right now. I wanted something small enough to operate with one hand and to easily fit in my pocket.My previous phone was an original Moto X and that was a great size for me so I wanted something similar, but all of the OEMs were only producing these massive devices that require two hands to operate. I mean really, how am I supposed to text and drive if I have to take both hands off the wheel? (That's a joke, NEVER text and drive.)So I did tons of research, using the phone comparison feature on sites like gsmarena.com to check the physical dimensions. The other problem was that when I did find a ""small"" phone, it usually had terrible specs. A dumbed down processor from 2 generations ago, not much memory, and often a mediocre camera.Then I found the Sony Xperia Z5 compact. This phone is small but it doesn't skimp on performance. It actually has the same processor as Google's flagship Nexus 6P, so it's blazing fast. Comes with 2GB ram (the 6P has 3GB though I believe) and 32GB built in storage which is easily expanded with an microSD card. Camera is top notch too, being from Sony who has been making cameras and camera lenses for a long time. The other nice thing is the battery life, since it has a good sized battery paired with a smaller screen, the screen actually drains the battery less than on the bigger devices. When I first bought it, I was easily getting 2 days of battery life but now that is more like a day or day and a half depending on my usage.I actually ordered it here unlocked because nobody else is carrying it in the US. When mine arrived, the menus were all in Chinese, but a quick YouTube search showed me how to switch them back to English and I was all set.I'm a big Android fan so I was weary of what kind of bloatware Sony might have installed on this. But it's really not bad at all and feels very similar to a pure android experience. There are a few little things that are different and you can uninstall any of the Sony pre-installed apps without any issue. Mine was also recently OTA'd to Marshmallow which seemed to improve performance quite a bit.Overall, I'm so happy I bought this phone. It's the perfect size if you're looking for a small Android device and has enough processing power to keep up with the latest devices. Oh, the built in fingerprint scanner in the power button is super nice too, as is the physical camera shutter button. Both of these are features I use daily. (Note: I heard that the US spec phones won't have the fingerprint scanner, so be sure to check if that matters to you.)"

The z1c had the highest build quality in my opinion (the metal casing exuding the appearance of ""high-end""). The z5c is a step down from here, although the performance is updated, the phone does not look or feel high-end in your palm. This isn't a huge deal to me as I primarily use this phone for travel; the small size, waterproofing, and low-key appearance are all assets. However unlike the z1c, I don't enjoy using the z5c at home in the states. One big gripe for me has been the fingerprint scanner. The iPhone will read and unlock my prints 90% of the time, the z5c is probably more like 60% for me. I'm sure experiences will vary.In all its a mediocre phone, but given the choices out there, it is by far the best Android in this size.

"397619","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact E5823 2GB/32GB 23MP 4.6-inch 4G LTE Factory Unlocked (WHITE) - International Stock No Warranty",5,"I bought this for my wife, to replace her (still functional, just aging) Moto G LTE (1st Gen). If you're looking at this product, you're probably aware of the general lack of high-end, small-form-factor Android phones. If you want high-end, you usually have to get something substantially larger than this, and my wife did not want a larger phone. She also wanted something with a much better camera. The z5 compact delivers. She's had it a month now, and she likes it a lot. (I've used it quite a bit as well). The camera is responsive and extremely high quality - it does fairly well in low light as well. The battery life is nothing short of outstanding. Sony's take on Android squashes battery consumption when the phone is idle, even with background apps (facebook messenger, facebook, various google services) all running. I've used a moto x (1st gen), moto x (2nd gen), moto g LTE (1st gen) all recently -- this phone has markedly better battery life than those. It's also stable and fast - the only (very) minor gripe one could have about this phone is Sony's mild modification to the UI, which is not stock. I don't really like the blue menu bars on settings & so on, but once the thing is set up, you shouldn't have to go in to those... so this is mostly a nonissue. Also, the Sony/xperia migration tool made migrating sms messages, pictures, and so on a breeze. This phone is fantastic.Regarding cell coverage and compatibility, we use this phone with Cricket Wireless, which is an AT&T MVNO. The ""bars"" meter apparently is calibrated a bit lower than other phones (ie, displaying 3 bars vs 4, etc), but the actual dB reading is the same as my moto phones on the same carrier in the same location. I'd expect this phone to work absolutely fine with post-paid AT&T service as well, seeing as how it works without issue on their prepaid subsidiary. I cannot vouch for whether or not the carriers can actually activate a new SIM on this phone, however -- I took her old SIM (already activated), cut it, and put it in this phone, which worked fine. I did have to put in the access point (AP) settings, but that's standard practice if you're used to Cricket or other prepaid carriers.re: warranty, I get squaretrade warranties for phones anyway. I'm not sweating the alleged lack of US warranty, though other reports are mixed as to whether Sony would really give you the cold shoulder if you had a legitimate hardware issue with the device.The phone came with an international AC converter to convert it to US 120V to... something else. I live in the United States. I'm not intimately familiar with exactly what kind of converter this is. It comes with a US 120V to USB charger in the box, and then is bundled with this international AC-to-US120V-AC adapter outside. It also has a pair of earbuds in the box."

The phone is smaller than most smart phones these days but does anything and everything you want it to do. It even has one of the fastest (if not the fastest) processors onboard.

I had some lingering items to wrap up on my old phone, and today I'll be getting ATT service connected. My goal was to keep a smaller phone (~4.5"") like my previous unit to preserve the 1 handed capability, and convenient pocket fit. I don't want a tablet for a phone, and have struggled to find a good modern model match for my needs. The Z5C looked to be a great match, and so far, it's a perfect fit for me.Package appeared to have been opened, however carefully, and then re-sealed. I suspect the reason it was opened was the addition of a US plug adapter for the EU style plug the unit comes with, as it does not look like a Sony converter. Where the phone uses a pretty standard 5V, 1500mA mUSB charger, of which I have a bunch, this wasn't a big deal. All other packages in the box (headphones, USB cable, extra earbud cushions, documents) were all intact and looked brand new, untouched. Phone itself still had original sticky film and packaging, and was in perfect new condition.Phone turned right on, and was ~60% charged. I was prompted quickly to change the language (second or third screen) as I ran setup from German to English I organized the OS as I prefer my phone laid out and set up and connected to wifi. The phone immediately ran two major system updates in parallel, and then after a restart, ran another. I'm now on Android 5.1.1, and admittedly, I'm not sure what it shipped with before the updates as they happened so fast.I love the square edges, which allow for some grip in a smartphone world where everything is slick and like holding onto a watersock if you don't have a cover on it. The phone looks like a sleek, black slab of sexy tech. Seriously, what a cool looking, striking design. The photos don't do it justice. I did buy a low profile cover for drop protection, and have used it intermittently. Compared to the IPhone 6 or the new Galaxy Edge, this is much easier to hold one handed without worrying about it squirting onto the pavement. That said, it's still a pretty slick and smooth piece of hardware in general, and I'd suggest a cover/protection.The phone is a great unit, and a perfect fit for my needs. I love the frosted glass back, the large screen/body ratio, and the charcoal colored polycarb frame.. I know some people take stars away for not liking the case/finish (non metal), but I find that odd. If you don't like it, why'd you drop $500 on it? It's a first class material, so the rest is just opinion. It actually has a pretty metallic look anyways. No one's going to look at this and say ""man, what a cheap looking phone. I promise. Phone does get a bit warm (which I really only experienced during the initial startup/setup), but there's a lot of horsepower in there, and that's to be expected. Nothing that bothered me.The fingerprint tech is awesome, and responds quickly and flawlessly. I have a few different fingers stored so that it's a comfortable unlock both righty and lefty. The hardware is clearly sufficient, as I've had a dozen things going on at once including downloading, a bluetooth beam, installing and updating apps, surfing a few internet tabs and writing a note all at once, and Android ran smooth, slick, quick and didn't break a sweat. Phone a very *solid* feel, very high quality, and certainly a first class phone that can be discussed in the circles of the current high end smartphone competition.Two minor drawbacks that I didn't think were worth removing a star for:1) No wireless charging. If the unit didn't have the rapid charge capability, this may have been a -1, but it charges so damned fast, and keeps charge so long, I couldn't do it. Still would be cool to drop it on those powermats at starbucks. Oh well.2) Volume buttons are too low on the thumb side (righty.) These should have been up top. I'm guessing there was a hardware conflict, but either way, it's a nitpick worth mentioning.Setup with personal and work emails was seamless, and calendar, emails and contacts all downloaded via wifi quickly and easily.I'm headed to ATT to finalize my new account and get the carrier service completed. Unless you see a follow up note from me, assume it also went smoothly."

A portion of the picture will turn out yellow due to the broken camera.The design pretty much means this phone is only usable in the right hand. Not very nice for a lefty phone holder."

I understand some people like big phones, however, that's not my preference. That's why when the S5 came out, I started looking for something else. Then I found the Sony's Xperia Z Compact phones. I had originally wanted the Z3+ (Z4 elsewhere), but right when I was about to buy it, the Z5 Compact came out. While it's not available in the US via normal retailers, I was able to get a warranty for it via SquareTrade. So that made it a no brainer for me. I've had it for a few months now and I'm still loving it."
"397626","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact E5823 2GB/32GB 23MP 4.6-inch 4G LTE Factory Unlocked (WHITE) - International Stock No Warranty",5,"It's been a few weeks and having no issues so far. The white color looks great. Good form factor but when the phone gets hot, it becomes uncomfortable to hold so I def recommend a case. The phone is also a bit thick though I suppose it's necessary due to the waterproof material and other hardware necessities to make it up to par with typical devices.The SIM and SD card slots are easily accessible. Fingerprint sensor works great and is super convenient. Battery life lasts a full day but I don't see it going past a full day on normal usage (I'm typically on wifi and 4G). Sony also releases frequent software updates which is amazing compared to manufacturers like Samsung and HTC that take forever to come out with updates. Recently there was a update which allows the camera to launch much faster."

This phone is snappy and can handle doing multiple things at one time without slowing down. I have had it for over a month and it hasn't done anything out of the ordinary. Battery life is phenomenal, especially with the stamina mode on. Camera is sweet. This is a phone I can trust. Nothing about it seems fishy. It's fast and reliable and fits in my hand much better than those giants that are passing as normal size phones nowadays. Thank you Sony :)"
"397628","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact E5823 2GB/32GB 23MP 4.6-inch 4G LTE Factory Unlocked (WHITE) - International Stock No Warranty",4,"Coming from the Z3C, I can't help but make some comparisons to that phoneThe good:• Shipping was very quick• Phone was flawless in its original packaging• Very quality build and heft to it. Doesn't feel cheap or plasticky at all.• Screen is nice and bright. Call quality is excellent.• Easy to navigate screen interface one handed. Holding it correctly, with your pinkie under the bottom to support the phone, there should be no issue using one handed. Your thumb should be able to reach all spots on the display. As far as I know, this is the only newly released premium handset in this size/form factorThe bad:• Like the Z3C, the back is glass, although frosted this time so the grip is slightly better. Premium feel, but very fragile.• Despite the faster CPU, the interface is slower and not as instant as the Z3C when opening apps.• Battery life is not as good as the Z3C, but still better than any other premium smart phone out there. I was charging every other day with the Z3C, but must charge at the end of the day with the Z5C. This is with moderate use.• The camera is just above average. With Sony optics you would think it would be better than it is.• When taking a photo, the camera is slow to open, and even slower to preview a picture just taken. Can be an issue when trying to catch a moment at just the right time.• For T-mobile, although the hardware supports band 12, T-mobile's 700MHz spectrum, it is not enabled. So you may find spotty reception in areas where you had excellent reception in the past with a T-mobile phone purchased from the carrier. This is more a carrier issue than Sony, since the support is there built into the hardware."

"397634","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact E5823 2GB/32GB 23MP 4.6-inch 4G LTE Factory Unlocked (WHITE) - International Stock No Warranty",4,"I am a previous owner of the sony xperia z3 compact. This version came with a micro USB cable, power brick, headphones, and some manuals( mostly were not in English). The phone will have android version 5.1.1 (lollipop) straight out of the package with a few pre-installed software that you can delete. After just receiving this phone I noticed that the design was different, and the original fingerprint magnet glass on the rear of the phone from the z3c is replaced by frosted glass. So No more finger prints. Also the phone is slightly more thicker than the z3c and the edges are more round with a matte feel to it. There is only one flap on the left side to insert a memory card or micro SD card on the side. The volume keys are now under the power button which needs getting used to for me. The phone can be charged from the bottom using a micro USB cable which is included. You no longer have to open a flap to charge the phone which doesn't change the fact that the phone is still water proof/resistant. The power button is now longer providing a finger print sensor which works flawlessly so far. I haven't got much time into the user interface but have noticed that the display is very dim compared to the z3c if the adaptive brightness setting is on. So far it feels responsive, no lag, a few tweaks in the UI, and 4G LTE works fine for me. The camera is now 23 MP with fast auto focus, and the front facing camera is 5 MP. Overall great phone, but design could have been better and display is still 720p.UPDATE: Dropped phone on concrete from just above 3ft (with no case), and slightly dented the phone's edge. Screen survived any cracks or damage and phone still works fine."

They are great size, and fast performance. I don't know why people rave about camera. The quality of the camera is pretty nice, but the software that Sony runs is really slow. Sure, the camera is great, but it takes forever for the camera app to load and and focus on shots. The speed of the phone I love. The weight of the phone is more on the heavier side. I wish it was lighter and also thinner. The phone is a little thick and the volume rocker is in an awkward position. I like the dedicated camera button and I love the features the phone comes with inside its settings. I don't enjoy the placement of the front camera and it also takes some crappy photos as compared with photos taken from the front camera on the iPhone.

"397637","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact E5823 2GB/32GB 23MP 4.6-inch 4G LTE Factory Unlocked (WHITE) - International Stock No Warranty",3," There is a lot to like about the phone but there are a variety of issues too:1. Most importantly: this phone has a problem with touchscreen sensitivity in the lower part of the screen when the phone is not held in hand. It is particularly bad on some surfaces such as on a bed. Also the problem gets much worse if you install a glass protective screen. It starts being very noticeable on almost all surfaces.I've made a quick demonstration video about the issue (see below). Other users have reported this issue with their phone https://talk.sonymobile.com/t5/Xperia-Z5-Z5-Compact-Z5-Premium/z5-compact-touchscreen-acting-weird/m-p/1079627/highlight/false#M6713Therefore it is a design defect by Sony. Surprisingly it appears to affect only the white version of the phone.2. It does heat up quite a lot during normal use (like updating apps) or watching videos. And the battery is drained faster than on previous version that I have (Z1 Compact)3. I didn't see any improvement in photo quality compared to the old Z1 (in fact some pics look worse in identical settings). At the same time there is a substantial improvement in focusing and in video quality."
"397638","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact E5823 2GB/32GB 23MP 4.6-inch 4G LTE Factory Unlocked (WHITE) - International Stock No Warranty",4,"I have had this phone for 2 weeks now, and I still have things to evaluate, but so far these are my observations when compared to the features of my prior Galaxy S4 miniFirst pros. this is truly an amazing phone with so many features well beyond my previous Samsung S4 mini. The screen is great, and let's you choose enhancements to it that make pictures and videos really stand out. A 23 MP camera, take very good (albeit large sized) pictures; I have yet to try it in darker situations, where apparently it has been challenged in other reviews. It runs smoothly even when multiple apps are open, and its a breeze to switch between apps. The finger scanner works neatly, although the location will only allow you to use it with your right hand; you can also set up multiple users or guests to the phone, with their own apps, settings and finger scans (kind of like a computer profile), which is great for kids not messing up your settings. It has a ton of customizable phone features for screen, power management sounds, app management, that I was no where close to have with the smaller Galaxy -you can program what the phone will do when you plug it to the charger, when it connects with your car's bluetooh, or when you plug in head phones, so different apps can activate automatically. I do not own a PS3, but apparently you can hook it up somehow to PS3 controllers and play games through it (sounds like a cool feature); it also offers you a lot of connectivity options to external devices like Chromecast. Something I really liked was the corrector/dictionary, actually allows me to type in two different languages and word suggestions come in both without specifying or switching between languages,while keeping your keyboard in the desired setting. Aesthetically the phone looks nice, with a smooth finish front and back; the side material does look on the cheap side though, it would have been nice to have metal on the side instead, but that may hamper the waterproofing capabilities (it says waterproof, but I have n o intention of testing that on a phone w/o warranty). The back is also made of a glassy finish, which does make it a bit slippery in your hands. Finally, the size of the phone (the main thing that drove me to it) is great for its category; Sony really put a lot of features into a small package, making it feel like a flagship rather than a 2nd tier mini version you find of other smaller phones.So for the cons: Its not really the phones fault, but this is a european phone on american network, which means its not fully compatible (at least with Tmobile). It lacks the 3G 1700 band, all other bands apparently are the same as Tmobile network. This has the phone constantly switching between 3G and HSDPA and will drain the battery out in a day or less. I tried the phone for a week in Florida (Ft Lauderdale area) and in Texas (Houston area) and it is about the same, in spite of being large metropolitan areas. I cant tell exactly if HSDPA is equivalent to 4G or 4G LTE connectivity speedwise, so when it is on that it seemed fast-ish. When I mean constant switching I mean sometimes you would actually have to move the phone around so it would get the signal right and download things. This, added to the low battery life, is somewhat annoying which is sad, because the phone does have these apparently great customizable battery saving features that tell you you should have the phone for more than a day without charge, of course it does not count on the phone switching between networks so frequently and battery barely lasts a day with moderate use.Maybe the phone works better on other carriers, it is truly unfortunate that Tmobile/Sony have not agreed to provide this phone on the US market, it is really an awesome phone by itself. If someone knows how to do away with the network issues, or of a carrier where it will work well, let me know"

"397643","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact E5823 2GB/32GB 23MP 4.6-inch 4G LTE Factory Unlocked (WHITE) - International Stock No Warranty",1,"**SEE UPDATE BELOW**I've been using this phone for over 3 weeks now and I so glad I went with the Z5C.HARDWAREIt heats up a bit when doing heavy gaming or long video recordings, but not all too concerning...especially considering I don't notice any heat during typical daily operation. I would say the battery is adequate but it wouldn't be considered one of the strengths of this phone. I don't imagine battery life gets any better with other phones unless you go bigger...which, why the hell would you be looking at this phone if you were willing to do that? Go with the Xperia Z5. That said, I haven't experimented too much with ""stamina mode"" but if you use alternate messaging services / apps (like Google Voice) or music streaming apps, you'll have to add those apps as exceptions to be able to use data when the screen is off...which will diminish the benefit of ""stamina mode"" and preclude you from using ""ultra stamina mode"" all together. This is my first Quick Charge 2.0 device and I'm very impressed with how much charge you can get out of having it plugged in a just a while (ie 10 minutes). Wireless charging would've been nice to have but I'll gladly sacrifice that feature to get dual front facing speakers, expandable memory, and water resistance.Speaking of expandable memory. My buddy was playing with a camera-equipped drone his girlfriend got him for Christmas and was bummed he couldn't get the videos off the micro SD card (he didn't have an adapter). Everyone at the party (iPhone users) was blown away at how I was able to get and share the video by putting the micro SD card in my phone and using Google Drive to share it. I don't know why we are letting phone manufacturers sucker us by buying phones without expandable memory.At 720p screen resolution / quality looks great to me. If reading small text is difficult or annoying or you plan on watching HD full-length movies on your phone, get a bigger phone. I have excellent eyesight and find this display great for watching YouTube videos or reading articles.I don't take a lot of photos / videos but I'm pleased with the camera so far. You can find great camera comparisons online. From what I found this camera is great but Samsungs perform better in low-light and close up focusing...but the Z5C is a huge step up from my HTC One M7 when it comes to low light pictures.SOFTWAREI was a big fan of HTC's Sense UI and didn't know how I'd like Sony's UI as this is my first smartphone from them. After downloading an HTC-like free clock / weather widget, I like the UI a lot. Screenshots and screen capture are particularly easy and fun. Still waiting for Android 6.0 Marshmallow update that was promised (see summary below).SUMMARYAs far as I know the perfect phone doesn't exist but based on the other flagship phones available right now and my preference for water-resistance, expandable memory, and front facing speakers...I was prepared to give this phone a perfect 5 stars. I'm giving it 4 however because it would appear that Sony is following the lead of others by promising ""soon"" updates to the latest android version (6.0 Marshmallow) to help sell their new flagship phone but then making those of us who believed them and bought the phone wait around while the update is delayed. If the update comes prior to the new year I'll adjust my review to 5 stars. Almost 3 months for an update seems like enough time to tailor Marshmallow to their UI...if it was a priority.**UPDATE**This is the worst phone I've ever had. On paper it's great but I've never been so frustrated with lagging issue. I'll get a phone call while its in my hand and I'll mis the call because pushing ""answer"" is non-responsive. Killing apps helps a bit but I find myself restarting the phone a lot. I was hoping the Marshmellow update would help but its now March 8th & still no update. First & last time I buy a Sony phone. Since the Galaxy S7 is water resistant with expandable memory, I think I'll get it if a softwarw update comes soon & fixes my problems."

I've only owned Nexi before this, but I find Sony's customizations are almost all additive, like glove mode or being able to reboot or screenshot with a click of the power button. Any uninstallable apps you don't like, just disable in Settings.I use mine without a case and with a lanyard (not included, but I bought some silver ones on Amazon for about $5), which adds no bulk, keeps the phone pure but like a case, offers (preventative) protection against drops. Some have complained about the ""lip"" of the outer frame, but I don't find it remotely bothersome in hand and it protects the glass. It's functional - something any great design must be, not just beautiful. I laugh at all the iPhones wearing ugly cases.I have noticed a couple of intermittent software bugs here & there (example: blacks sometimes look gray when waking from sleep and auto-adjust brightness is on) but nothing I can't live with, and Sony has OTA-air shipped both a firmware and a camera update in the month I've owned the phone.Battery life is great, solidly over a day with moderatly heavy screen-on time use and up to two days with Stamina mode enabled.Just buy it.

My previous phone was a Droid Mini because it was the smallest Android phone available on Verizon. I was hesitant to switch from Verizon because I had been with them for a decade, but I have had no problems so far on AT&T and the Z5 Compact performs great and feels great (much better than the plasticky Droid Mini). In terms of battery life I would take the Mini off of the charger at 7am and with light-average usage it would be dead by 4pm.

It's hands-down the most premium feeling phone I've held - and that's with it swinging against the big guns such as the S6 Edge, HTC One, and iPhone 6.Cons:-I'm not a huge fan of the frosted back, and think it would have looked better with a normal glass back or just a continuation of the excellent plastic used for the sides. This is largely personal preference though.-The volume rocker is in an extremely awkward position. Unlike the Z3 Compact, you really have to work to use it. Would have been better located above the power button.-It comes in Japanese, and it's very difficult to find the language setting. Pull down the notification bar, then again for settings, click the gear, scroll down to the keyboard, then the top setting.Pros:-The fingerprint sensor/power button is fantastic. It's placed perfectly, works fast, and has just the right feel.-Impeccable fit and finish.-Near stock android.-Design.-Specs.-Camera button, which is sadly a dying feature. The quick-launch ability alone makes it worth having."

This phone is exactly what the iPhone users are hanging onto, a sub 5 inch phone with competitive specs. The 720p resolution is totally fine for the size of the screen. If you feel like it is a big sacrifice, just remember it improves the battery life (up to 2 days). The camera is pretty amazing and the expandable memory (micro sd) is also a breath of fresh air coming from an iPhone. If you want the freedom of Android and a reasonably priced phone (unlike the iPhone), then do not hesitate, BUY IT!"
"397653","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact E5823 2GB/32GB 23MP 4.6-inch 4G LTE Factory Unlocked (WHITE) - International Stock No Warranty",5,"This phone is exactly what I've been looking for. I have small hands and would like it if it were even smaller, but I can't complain since it's pretty small compared to all the phones available now. I have att and it works great. The screen looks great, it's snappy, and I even like that it's not so thin. Really thin phones are hard to hold and even cramp my hands sometimes. Battery life is about average. Fingerprint sensor works great. Although battery isn't removable, SD and Sim cards are. I really wish Sony success because I'd hate to see this line of phones go away."
"397654","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact E5823 2GB/32GB 23MP 4.6-inch 4G LTE Factory Unlocked (WHITE) - International Stock No Warranty",5,"I've had my device for one and personally it's just what I was looking for! Prior to the Z5C I owned the Z3 (5.2 in screen) and I love that phone but I wanted something a bit smaller in hand. At first I was kind of iffy going from a 1080 to a 720 display resolution but honestly you can barely tell a difference. You would really have to pay close attention to the screen to point out the difference. I am glad I wen with the Z5C, it is a premium phone in a compact size. I've yet to try the camera but I did video recorder for a few minutes and the 4K recording is amazing. How can such a compact device record so well and crisp! Thank you Sony!"

AC Charger is (I'm assuming) German, so though the USB itself is universally compatible, you'll need to use or buy a different wall adapter.It's in Lollipop, I believe, and easily upgrades to Marshmallow (and even Nougat!) soon. However, it must charge halfway before you can do that (Was at about 10% for me), and the series of updates gets it *extremely* hot. Speaking of which, CPU overheating happens terrifyingly frequently, though I should say that I can't notice any performance problems, just the absurd temperature rise (115F+) and some battery drain.Pros:Now, the battery - when you have it in normal mode it's unremarkable. Drains at a standard rate. BUT, when you switch it to ""Stamina"", sweet baby Jesus. Essentially, it doubles the battery life. Of course, one would assume this takes a serious toll on performance - but only two (quite tolerable) perceivable changes happens. The brightness becomes to adaptive brightness what adaptive brightness is to 100%. Basically, it's a bit darker than adaptive brightness at 100%. Though, I already have it at adaptive - having it at full, 100% brightness before turning Stamina on seems to put it at regular adaptive brightness.That paragraph was aggressively confusing, sorry folks. The other thing is that internet apps such as Snapchat and Kik will not give you notifications *until you open them once after Stamina is on*. This means that Stamina force stops them, and you can get your notifications back once you open them. You can also make exceptions to what apps Stamina optimizes in the battery settings. I'm sure Stamina also strongly affects your network and internet speed/usage, so if you're an avid mobile gamer you might want to keep it off (or get the Xperia XZ!)Here's how long the battery lasts for me (if I were to do these individual tasks and only them straight from a full charge until it died):Standby: 2 days / Stamina: 4 daysInternet Browser (no videos): 12 hours / Stamina: 18 hoursMusic: 1 day / Stamina: 3 daysVideo (local or streaming): 6 to 9 hours for both, depends on quality and all thatCalls (video): 2 to 5 hours for both, again probably depends on qualityCamera/Recording (rear): See ""Video""Snapchat, specifically: Just...

But there's some Jekyll and Hyde going on here. Turn off one too many lights, and NOISE NOISE NOISE NOISE NOISE. It will look like Barney the Dinosaur jammed his hand into a blender and tossed the bits all around like confetti. Use the flash.Display: They fit as much pretty as the can into a lackluster 720p size. You have a couple of settings that will allow you to add more realism or straight up saturation to your photos/videos. Motion is swift and crisp.Music: Dear lord, if you are an audiophile or even a pseudo-audiophile such as myself, get yourself a Sony phone. A few accessory/media specs before I go into this: I've been using Shure SE215 earphones to listen to mostly film scores (such as Hans Zimmer) and theatrical rock (such as Muse) on Poweramp Music Player with the EQ/Tone leaning slightly towards low bass, low mids, and high treble frequencies (and away from the rest).It's so beautiful. The instrumental separation is phenomenal. I can't describe it much in a way other than this - if your average phone is a kid flapping a leather cape from Spirit Halloween into a phone mic and playing it back through Beats headphones, this is the sound of Batman's cape fluttering in the wind as he dive bombs. It's sophisticated and elegant, but powerful, with deadpan presentation. It has closer to a monitor sound, rather than leaning towards bass or mids the way most phones do, so it's more customizable.You have a ridiculously, hilariously, mind-bogglingly expansive wealth of audio settings, from an algorithm that attempts to present 16-bit/44khz audio as 24-bit/96khz to Sony's classic dynamic normalizer to a truly absurd selection of surround sound settings. The in-house EQ is pretty lame, which is why I don't use their default music player, but the HR audio upgrade is compatible with power amp. You are also able to play originally 24/96 audio files *at that quality*! Your iPhones and your Galaxies won't do that. Shame that I'm sending that through 16/44headphones though, which defeats the purpose. Overall, sound quality is unparalleled by non-Xperias and the best part of the phone.Customization: Yes, there are themes, and some of them are pretty cool, but don't get them through the settings or the What's New app! Go straight to the Play Store. Try ""Cubot"" - it's free and customizes just about everything in Sony's UI to a *very* cool blue/black theme.TL;DR: Photographer: It's a great choice.

This is probably due to the bad marketing job from Sony in America, and a botched phone agreement with a couple of the big carriers. The Z5C is a phone for someone who values a compact size phone that has power, good battery life, good camera, and isn't looking to watch videos. There are plenty of reviews out there about what the critics think, but I just want to point out a couple of big wins for me.1. This phone allows me to stream music over bluetooth headphones while taking pictures at the same time. I value this because I work at a gym and usual do both things at the same time. When I take a photo there is no skip in the music. Everything is seamless. It is something that other phones can't do (Samsung S6 Edge).2. This phone has a very stock flavor of Android. While I wish it had marshmallow right now for the SD card system integration and doze features. Sony does plan on pushing out Marshmallow for this phone. For the time being, I'll just use the SD card slot for video and photos. The Stamina feature that Sony puts on the system appears to help a lot with battery longevity.3. I can use the phone on AT&T (Not verified) or T-Mobile (verified) workingPlease don't hesitate to ask a question about the phone. I was a little nervous about purchasing it at first, but worth it."

My phone is for texting, mobile emails, taking pictures and little else. I wanted a phone with long battery, compact size, and a great camera, and the Xperia Z5 Compact fits all of those requirements. I bought the unlocked version so I can take my phone abroad with zero issues, but I also like that it doesn't come bloated with the apps from American wireless carriers.The battery life has decreased slightly since I first got the phone, but I can still make it through two days without charging, even after using demanding apps."

I wanted a smaller phone, with an actual FM radio, decent camera, and the Z5 compact seemed to fit the bill nicely. I dad some issues with the software on the phone not seeing our hidden Wi-fi network, even though the network was saved. But a reboot of our router seemed to remedy this just. Only remaining issue is my computer being able to access the phone over USB. This was possible with my previous phone, with just a USB cable, and without any additional software. However, this phone (or Android 6) seems to have taken away the ""Mass Storage"" option for USB, and the phone is suggesting software to be installed on my computer to be able to access it..."
"397697","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",5,"I'm happy I upgraded from Nexus 5.Waterproof and good camera will allow me to retire my Panasonic TS3. This will reduce number of devices I pack and eliminate the need for taking a TS3 picture for quality and a phone picture for public WiFi email."
"397698","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",3,"Great form factor, battery life, and performance. Kinda sucks that they dropped the magnetic charging pins from the Z3C. And it's a bit offensive that they blow away their DRM keys when you unlock the bootloader."
"397699","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",5,"Sony Xperia z5 Compact is the ONLY small size smartphone with true premium specs. It is way above and beyond the competition. I'm not going to go over phone's features in this review as they are all well discussed in many publications. I do want to comment on 3 features the phone has been critised for unfairly in my opinion: First is the price - some critics say it is too expensive. Give me a break! The phone costs $450 plus $40 you have to shell out for 128GB SD card. That is $500. Compare that to iPhone 6s or Samsung Galaxy 6s with 128GB at $850 & $900 respectively and you will realize that Sony phone is a bargain. And that is comparing apples to apples because Sony phone is surely on par features and quality wise with both Apple & Samsung. The second point of criticism is the lack of 1080p HD screen. Again give me a break! On 4.6"" screen you will NEVER notice the difference between 720 and 1080p resolution no matter how good your eyesight is. And finally the lack of fingerprint sensor on us version (it is available on the international version). In opinion of many experts in the field the fingerprint technology is not mature enough especially both security and reliability wise. Most importantly it takes me virtually the same time to unlock the phone with a 4 digit code as with a fingerprint scanner - I tested it many times on my wife's iPhone 6s. So get over it or get an international model if you can't. Thank you Sony for the awesome phone!"
"397700","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",5,"great"
"397701","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",2,"I really wanted to like this phone. On paper, it had all the specifications I wanted. Unfortunately the overheating issues are true. On just the setup of the phone, it started warming up and became hot to touch. I can't imagine holding this up to my face or trying to hold it for extended amounts of time. It's a bummer because I haven't found another compact phone of this size with the features this one had.If you aren't bothered by a hot phone, then this is a great phone. Otherwise this is not the phone you are looking for."
"397702","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",5,"Very good everything worked as expected ! Phone was unlocked with full LTE coverage."
"397703","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",5,"Gréta:)"
"397704","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",3,"This is our families' 5th Xperia phone. The phone itself is the very best we've owned. Only drawback is the extremely poor customer service and long repair times if service is required. Any form of repair by Sony will cost at least a month without your phone and it is impossible to contact their repair facility. Would give a five start rating to each of the Xperia phones we've owned if Sony had better repair service. I miss the magnetic charging port on previous models."
"397705","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",5,"Very good phone for less money"

"397709","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",4,"I want to write an update for this phone. I now had this phone for 8 months. The marshmallow update 6.0.1 fixed all of the cons of this phone. Phone does get warm to the touch but that is during heavy usage. This happens when you spend 2 hours streaming or playing games and the battery drops down to 10%. You then plug it in to charge and resume your constant streaming and games.The phone does get slow when you have like 10 apps running at once. But that's with every phone. What I did enjoy was some photos i took underwater. See Photos. I really enjoy how it is somewhat water proof. Please know that it was under water for maybe less than 20 seconds.__________________________________________________________I just recently bought this phone 7 days ago. The shipping was prompted and the item looked well. This phone is really good but once the memory usage gets past 80 percent, it lags. If you are going to buy this phone, take out all the preinstalled app you wont be using and only install apps you will be using on a regular basis. It worked better after i got my memory uses below 70%"
"397710","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",5,"So I have been waiting for this phone to be available for a LONG time and am so glad it stands up to virtually all my expectations. If only they could have made it a LITTLE smaller!So the first thing I want to note is that this DOES indeed work with Tmobile with no manual setup or configuration - I just went into the Tmobile store, told them I have a phone I want to activate, they gave me the nano-SIM which I put in, turned the phone on and everything worked including MMS messages - super simple!I tested Internet speed while cell reception was on 2 out of 4 bars LTE, and was getting an average of 4 Mbps.Even though T-Mobile's wifi calling won't work, I just installed the updated hangouts dialer app and I'm all set to make calls when off-network and on only wifi from my free Google number.I don't have very big hands, but can still hold use this with only one hand which is my main objective, and it looks great too! Front speakers are great and you can really tell the difference in sound when you turn the phone sideways and allow your ears to pick up the stereo effect.In regards to the camera, the automatic mode is great. However the maximum advertised resolution for both the front and back cameras is only achieved in 4:3, not 16:9 to match the wide screen, though 16:9 is available with slightly smaller resolutions.Battery life is great with stamina mode - after a full day of being connected to my Bluetooth and typical handful of calls and several texts though leaving Internet off, I got home at 5:30 with still 93% remaining!No overheating issues as some have mentioned - it was barely even warm after playing a graphically intense game for over 20 minutes +Overall very happy with this phone, and I have high hopes for durability."
"397711","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",5,"works well. beautiful device. too bad Sony doesn't market it well over here in US. And also too bad it took forever to get US version. But a great Android phone, great quality. Awesome battery life!"
"397712","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",1,"It worked great for one month and since then has only been s***ier. After bad, it gets worse and worse. Among the main problems there is that keys keep being pressed while locked (for example in your pocket) so every time you need it your phone you need to go through an identification process because it thinks you have been trying to enter the passcode too many times. It is also super slow and crashes all the time. I never had a phone as bad as this one. I think its gold reviews are probably based on the initial experience which, as I said, is not bad but quickly goes downhill."
"397713","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",5,"good phone"
"397714","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",5,"I'm a former iPhone 5 owner and I bought this phone because I wanted an android smartphone with the same compact form factor, without sacrificing the features I'd gotten used to. The Xperia z5 compact is slightly taller and wider than the iPhone 5, but still very easy to use with one hand (the same can't be said for most other smartphones on the market!)The build quality of this phone feels great - it's got a slick glass body with a hard plastic bumper around the edge. The phone is water-resistant while still leaving the headphone and microUSB charging ports uncovered, which is a nice upgrade from the previous model (Z3 compact). Note that the phone is rated to be dust and water resistant, but not completely waterproof - Sony will not guarantee protection from activities like taking photos underwater. While I would've liked to be able to take my phone swimming with me, it's nice to know it'll hold up to rain, sweat and spills that could damage most other devices. The only flap on the phone's body covers the SIM card tray and SD card slot, but it's not a major inconvenience as you shouldn't need to access these often. It's tempting to carry this phone with no case but I'm cautious with glass-backed phones so I purchased a cheap TPU case for it in case I drop it and it hasn't been a huge compromise, it's still very pocketable. The power button, volume controls and camera button are all along the right side of the phone - another reason I like having a case on this phone is that it's possible to trigger the camera button accidentally if you aren't used to a hardware camera button.The 23 megapixel camera was one of the main selling points for me, and it's by far the best camera I've had on a smartphone! The hardware button is convenient for capturing photos quickly, although the camera interface takes a little longer to capture photos than the one built into iOS. The automatic camera settings do a decent job at capturing most photos, but if you'd like more custom options a fully manual mode is available with the swipe of a finger, along with a slew of presets for different subject matter. I replaced the stock camera app with an open source alternative because it's a little bit faster and compatible with some other apps I've installed on my phone.I've seen people complaining about bloatware, but in my experience just about every smartphone comes with some pre-installed apps. At least most of the pre-installed apps on the Xperia z5 Compact can be deleted, unlike Apple's stock apps (which I always end up putting in a folder out of my way, where they still take up precious memory). This phone comes with a generous 32gb of storage on board, but can be expanded up to an additional 200gb with a microSD card. Out of the pre-installed apps there were a few I found useful, including Sony's lifelog app, which acts as an activity counter and lets you compare your physical activity with smart detection of walking, biking or time spent in a car - as well as the activities you use your phone for, such as web browsing, gaming and listening to music. The 4.6"" 720p screen might not be the best on the market for gaming or viewing media, but the on board speakers impressed me compared to most other phones I've used, and screen size is a compromise I'm willing to make for a phone so small. Also packaged on board is Sony's Playstation remote play app, which allows Playstation 4 owners to play Playstation games on their phone. I can't speak to how well this works because I don't own the console, but I haven't experienced any lag so far playing mobile games on this phone (although the handset will heat up a little during more graphically intense titles).Overall, the Z5 compact has given me everything I want out of a smartphone during the first couple of weeks I've owned it, but I will update this review if I run into any issues. If you're looking for a small but powerful android phone that will survive daily life and occasional accidents, this is the one!"
"397715","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",3,"No not really."
"397716","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",5,"good phone, I have not had a problem with heat issue. Iam very happy with purchase."
"397717","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",4,"It's a great phone, but the battery doesn't last 2 days as they say, and there is no headphones in the box."
"397718","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",4,"Phone is a great sizeBeautiful displayThrow feature is awesome for connecting your phone to DLNA devices and streamingHowever, phone runs hot, battery life is nowhere near what was advertised, and the side chassis seem to be coming unglued. Sony support is absolutely useless. I'll keep my cover on and hope it doesn't fail on me"
"397719","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",5,"I used to have the European version of the phone and I really loved it. I had a problem with the camera and couldn't fix it, so I decided to get the US version because I love the compact size and the processing power that comes with it."
"397720","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",2,"It's a great phone functionally, but whatever material they use for the screen will spontaneously decide to crack on you at some point. When that crack occurs, you will lose most or all touch functionality on your phone. If the crack happens to occur after a drop, no matter how slight or soft, Sony will refuse to cover it under warranty. Essentially, Sony is under the impression that an accidental drop is automatically ""misuse,"" despite the fact that I am not aware of a single person who has never dropped a mobile phone.I could swallow Sony's miserliness if it weren't for the fact that you can't even use your phone when the screen cracks. It is not purely cosmetic. Once your phone cracks, you MUST pay for a repair or buy a new phone as you lose all touch functionality on the phone. I don't know of any other line of phones that does this and I have only ever seen this problem with the Xperia line of phones. In fact, my previous phone was an Xperia Z2 Compact and I purchased the Z5 Compact after that phone had a screen crack that caused a cascading series of problems. Suffice to say, as much as I like the Sony line of phones, I will not purchase another anytime soon.UPDATE:To add salt into the wound, Sony is currently refusing to do even out of warranty repairs, meaning I'm stuck with either a broken phone or paying $145 for a repair at a local shop that cannot maintain the IP68 standard."
"397721","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",4,"Excellent!"
"397722","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",5,"I've been looking for a while for a small phone with good specs. This is exactly what I was looking for. There are zero other options if you want a phone this small with decent specs, storage, and Android Marshmallow. I have big hands, but the interface is smooth and easy to use. It isn't a ""small"" screen - it's what would have been considered a normal sized screen five years ago. It's solid feeling, gets good signal strength compared to my wife's iPhone, has a good battery life (with moderate use and no daytime charging I usually have 50% battery at the end of the day). The speakers sound decent when listening to music. Not superb, but much better than a lot of other phones and tablets I've used. Very usable for watching shows or movies using the built in speakers.High temperatures fixed: When it came in the mail, it had Lollipop installed. After the setup process, it felt quite hot. However, I then immediately did the over-the-air software upgrades. There were three updates in a row: The first an upgrade to Marshmallow, and then two more incremental upgrades / bug fixes. After those upgrades, it has never gotten hot again. A little warm, but comparable to any other phone I've ever used.You can uninstall or disable most of the Sony bloatware pretty easily, with the only exception being this What's Up app that was telling me about random celebrity birthdays and crap like that in the notifications. I got it to shut up and go away by disabling its data privileges.The camera is AMAZING. There is a built-in camera button, which I love. It has a two-level press like a real camera: soft press to focus, and hard press to snap photos. I wish the lens wasn't right on the corner though - I'm always sticking my finger in front of it by accident.My primary complaint is that I wish there was a hardware button bar at the bottom, so that the buttons (back, home, etc) didn't take up screen real estate. I guess that's a minor complaint though. I'm getting used to it, and they hide during videos or gaming.Note: if you want to use OTG devices, it isn't automatic. You have pull down and hit a button to attach OTG stuff. A little annoying, but if you're plugging in wired stuff to the mirco USB plug, you're not really expecting fast convenience anyway."
"397723","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",4,"nice cell phone the only details its the finger detector. doesn't work because the phone it's from the us and in that region its not compatible"
"397724","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",5,"Wow, what a great phone. I've never seen such stunning video quality on the phone. Just FYI my work phone is an iphone 6s.We got this for my husband unlocked to use on Tmobile. The sound is very very clear no issues there. Reception is great. Everything is fine.The camera quality is better than any other phone i've seen. No complaints so far.The phone size is just perfect. seems like every other phone company gets bigger can't even fit in the pocket but this one does!.One thing to note, didn't realize it only uses nano sim card. One quick trip to tmobile to upgrade old sim card. They come in 3 -1 now. So you can choose your size.Sony in my opinion has the best phones out on the market. Its too bad they didnt pick up the US, but i'm so happy they sell them unlocked for all of us in the states."
"397725","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",5,"Really nice phone. Meets all expectations."
"397726","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",1,"I want to love this phone, but it overheats in 15 minutes after doing practically anything.A lot of the overheating can be delayed by uninstalling or disabling the Sony bloat apps. Unfortunately, the X-Mobile display enhancement adds to the overhead and when it's turned off, causes a lot of stuttering to go away.I was ready to live with the problems because of the beautiful case and size, but it's impossible. The overheating causes stuttering in the daily use after about 10 to 15 minutes of use.I think the only thing that could save this phone is a CPU throttling, but I just don't want to do that for a phone of this expense.REVISED: I lowered the star by one due to seller concern."
"397727","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",5,"This is the Z5 Compact (not any of the other size models). Terrific phone and bloody fast! I can't comment on its tumble ability (haven't dropped it so far!), however it seems as though the screen wouldn't crack unless dropped from a significant height on any of the edges, or slamming facedown into a hard surface.Quality of life has improved with this device over my old iPhone 4S. Very speedy with great connectivity, and a beautiful camera. Screen is vivid and bright."
"397728","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",1,"It's not reliable.Bluetooth audio works about half the time; otherwise it either skips randomly, requiring a restart, or plays the audio through the device speaker. I reboot it more often than Windows 98.Text messaging gave out entirely for a day, then came back randomly.I just reset it because I stopped being able to receive group messages from two of my contacts.Camera's not that great, though I came from Lumia.Android does not have feature parity with Windows Phone in regards to voice control; phone will not messages to me in the car at all without an app and even then I've lost the ability to respond.Battery life is okay, form factor is great.I have moved off many of the Xperia apps in favor of the Googles ones, that caused some improvements but it's still very unreliable."
"397729","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",5,"So far so good. Had to switch my provider since i didn't know about the different types of cell signals but the business that sold the phone put a warning about that in the box which was nice. The phone does get a little warm after extended use or when using some of the more demanding features like recording in HD, but i haven't really had an issue with it. I like the phone and supporting a small business is always a plus."
"397730","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",1,"Where on earth do I begin. The screen is fragile I accidentally set a bottle down on it and cracked the screen purchased this phone because it was waterproof and I watched a video on YouTube with this kid dropping Hammers and whatnot off of a ladder onto this phone underneath 4 inches of water and I was under the belief that Not only was it waterproof but that it was nearly gorilla Corning Glass strong this is simply not true and the worst part is once you break the screen it will never be the same again Sony will not touch it if the screen breaks it's out of warranty specs in addition even if you can get this screen fixed which took me two months the waterproof install at the factory is special and no repair shop can get that installation repeated bottom line good luck otherwise I like the phone it's fast but too much bloatware totally"
"397731","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",1,"Does not come with US Warranty as described. Fantastic phone until the charging port failed and Sony refused to warranty it"
"397732","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",1,"Not only is it deceptively advertised (no fingerprint scanner on US version), it ran super super slow, and only had something like 75% of the stated storage capacity. I have no idea how a product that defective made it to market, but I'm staying away from Sony phones from now on."
"397733","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",5,"I've had this phone for 4 months now and it is the best phone I've ever had! I've always used flagship samsung phones and found that they slow down within a few months. This has not been the case with the Xperia z5c! It is fast and snappy, I've been able to play Pokemon Go seamlessly, I frequently stream HBO Go from my phone and also use it for snapchat, facebook, texting, calling, instagram, and web-browsing. I usually get a day to a day and a half of battery life. This decreases if you have the GPS on though. Phone only gets hot when I play Pokemon Go but during nothing else. It charges really fast as well. I love the feel of the phone, it is sturdy and block-like but fits well in my small hands. I've dropped it several times and have gotten it wet and it still works like new. Well-worth the price!"
"397734","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",5,"I switched to this phone from a iPhone 6S and I have to say I'm very happy that I did! Feels just as fast as the iPhone. Screen appears just as sharp and crisp as the iPhone even having a lower resolution. And the build quality feels premium. This is my first phone with front facing speakers and I have to say I do not want to switch back to anything els without them! Tested the water resistance and works perfectly. Fits in the hand great and is actually one handable for daily use. Even my normal size iPhone 6s was not. Also battery life is amazing in comparison to the iPhone. I could go two days if I wanted. I get home from a 8hour work day with normal use with around 50-65% battery. And some days that I'm busy and am not able to use my phone but a few times it will still be in the mid 90% range. Very happy I made the switch.Only con of this phone is the power button placement. I can deal with the volume rocker being in a weird location but the locm/power button is a headache. Every time I pick up the phone if I'm watching a video I accidentally hit the lock button because my had always grabs the phone on the sides right in the center.its a bad design flaw. But other than this the phone is perfect for me"
"397735","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",5,"This phone is excellent. Super fast and snappy. Everything just works well and the screen looks great. You can't even tell it's not 1080p. Best compact phone you can find."
"397736","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",5,"I love the small size of this phone. The general trend is to phones much larger than what I want."
"397737","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",5,"Excellent Phone"
"397738","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",2,"I purchased this phone due to the higher end specs of the phone in the smaller form factor. At first I was disappointed to learn that they removed the fingerprint reader from the power button, but I quickly got over that since I hadn't had it yet in my prior phones. Overall I enjoyed the phone at first. The form factor was good along with several other aspects. I didn't appreciate all of the Sony specific software that was on it, but I was able to overlook that for a while. Within a few months though I started having issues such as the phone running slowly, apps crashing, and the phone running hot due to apps continually running. I also had issues with connectivity with using T-Mobile and by using a phone that they're not used to it seemed to complicate things. I ended up getting a Google Pixel lately which was a huge improvement."
"397739","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",5,"Excellent phone"
"397740","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",5,"Great compact size phone, good battery life"
"397741","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",5,"It does get hot, but meh, get off your phone after using it. Enjoy life. It does perform really well though for games and such. Also it's a neat little phone for its size."
"397742","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",4,"This is a great phone if you're looking for the 4.7 inch range in a flagship smartphone and not wanting an iPhone! If I could, I would give this product 4.5/5 stars as that is more accurate for me.I think Sony did a great job with this phone. The camera is excellent, with my only gripe about it being that they should have spent more time optimizing it so that it launches more quickly. It still launches quickly, but it's just not quite as snappy as, say, a Galaxy S7 camera. Still quick to snap though. The dedicated camera button is also an EXCELLENT feature. Very useful for when you're trying to really get a good focus on a picture.My second gripe is that, when you connect headphones or an aux cable to this device, this little thing pops up MULTIPLE times that says ""Improve your headphone experience"" in the notifications bar. This is no big deal to me, EXCEPT for the fact that it pauses whatever video/media you're trying to play! It does this about 5 times, and then it stops. I CAN'T disable this, I have looked around for hours in settings as well as on forums. It is a bug that Sony needs to fix, and I hate it!The only other minor gripe is that the phone is just barely not as snappy as I would expect from a flagship spec'd phone such as this. What I mean by this is that sometimes apps just take a split second too long to switch between and it can be slightly annoying if I'm trying to go fast. This is a minor gripe, however, and not something that would make me reconsider my decision to purchase or recommend this phone.Overall, I really like this phone and it is so nice to be able to use it one-handed. It actually makes my job much easier if I'm using my phone while running an experiment (i.e. looking at a protocol, running a quick calculation, etc.) I purchased this phone through Amazon's warehouse deals, and while the packaging came pretty meh, the phone itself was PERFECT. Not a single flaw that I could perceive, and I got it for $100 less than retail. No warranty, but I've never needed to use it on any of the 5 cell phones I've had. It's only a 1 year warranty anymore on most phones anyway."
"397743","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",5,"great phone,no over heating problems. had the z3 phone,liked it a lot too. cracked the bace being in my rear pocket.like that this has a different back."
"397744","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",1,"This phone has many great features and was exactly the size I was looking for. I was pleased with many parts of this phone. However, hardware failures and a even worse experience with dealing with this customer service for warranty work leaves me wanting to list 0 stars. -5 stars.Within six months, the camera sensor died. Total failure. Call the warranty service department and find that I must ship the phone, at my own cost, to a service center for at least 21 businesses days. ( This means a month). When it is returned after a month, the camera works but now has a blue glow added in all pictures with a flash. Secondly, now I cannot talk on the handset because the ear speaker doesn't work anymore. Call warranty service again. They want me to pay to ship it to them for another month. I complained to manager , Cedric. He assured me that he would be personally finding me another solution within 24 hours. That was there days ago. No word, no email, no call.I owned this phone since March 2016, broke in September 2016, returned October 2016 broken, and will likely be sent back again and kept until December.They should sell this phone as a two pack because it breaks down and the service is so poor you will need to buy another phone to cover while it is being serviced.Bottom line: great phone until something breaks. And several things will. Buy anything else."

"397748","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",4,"This is a very nice phone.It is my second Sony phone, and a large leap in technology from my 2014 phone.It has an excellent camera, both front and back, easy set-up instructions, large micro-SD compatibility, and Android 6.x that supports installation of apps on the external SD."
"397749","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",5,"Finally, a full-powered phone that I can actually hold in my very small hands. This phone does everything I need and is one of the very few Android models out there that is not ginormous. I've got kid-sized hands so this is a big deal. Plus it actually fits in my pants pockets.Not super keen on the smaller-than average volume control buttons. But this is a small issue and acceptable tradeoff for the other phone benefits."
"397750","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",1,"Phone is fine, but I accidentally cracked the screen, and Sony is unable to fix the phone. I'm not looking for a warranty repair- just to get the phone fixed. But the Xperia service people say they can't take any out-of-warranty repairs due to some re-locating of the service department story, with NO ESTIMATE of WHEN THEY WILL START AGAIN!!!Sony- good phone. WORST SUPPORT EVER! Don't buy until you check the service/support!Update: They have now changed their story and have no plans to offer any kind of screen repair support. They have no plans to have any authorized 3rd party repair options either. Every mobile phone repair I have contacted also does not offer ANY sony phone repairs. BUYER BEWARE."

"397752","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",3,"Only thing keeping this phone at 3 stars for me is the fingerprint sensor being absent. Phone would be a home run if Sony had just included something that was already on the international version, it'd be one of the best phones I've had"
"397753","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",4,"have to get used to it"
"397754","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",5,"This is the phone that pulled me away from Blackberry!! Size does matter to me, as does battery life, build, and software. This Sony has it all. There are great enhancements to the OS and what I think are the best Android apps (top marks for the Mail and Calendar apps). Software support for the phone is great (PC backup, etc.) and I can't wait to try the Xperia Ear. If you are considering an Android phone or considering switching from iOS or BB this is your handset. As Sony isn't handled by any of the major carriers, please check compatibility at[...]"
"397755","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",4,"I owned the ""Xperia Z3 compact"" before and was pretty comfortable with it - until the display came loose at the upper right corner. I didn't realize that condition until I submerged the phone, testing the underwater skills which have been promoted in Sony's advertisements. The water entered and killed the phone. Of course these things are always going to happen after the warranty period... I suspect the high temperature of causing the seal to get loose. I live in a tropical area where the high noon temperatures sometimes reach the 100°F in the shade. Maybe the Z3 hasn't been in the shade...Nevertheless I purchased the ""XPERIA Z5 compact"" as successor of my previous phone as I'm enthusiastic about the SONY Xperia Z series. The Z5c hasn't many improvements compared to the Z3c, but I'm convinced of the new processor which makes the Z5c really fast. The autofocus is much faster and more precise.Until now the seals are tight even though I leave it sometimes in the sun. By the way, I noticed that SONY abandoned the previously promoted ""pool-underwater-sceneries"" in its advertisements, but only mentioned ""Doesn’t mind a little rain"". It seems to me that I've not been the only one with water-protection problems ;-)The missing fifth star is owed to 3 points:1. The battery doesn't last that long like the predecessor Z3c. The fast CPU takes its toll.2. It's the camera which really disappoints me. The Z3c had 21 Megapixels, the Z5c has 23 Mega. Too many in my opinion. Nice-weather-shots are OK, but since the majority of my Xperia photos consists of flash-photography, I yearn for my drowned Z3c.3. The US version - as the only one - has NO FINGERPRINT SENSOR! Why not???What conclusions did I come to? I'd buy it again and again! If you don't attach great importance to excellent low-light photos and are willing to charge the battery every day, the Xperia Z5 compact is a great phone to an affordable price."
"397756","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",1,"I started with an Xperia Z1 I went to Z3 and was very pleased. I now purchased the Z5 compact and it is overheating all the timeI would like to return this item it is not what I thought it would be. Very disappointed in this product.. I was expecting a good product from Sony and it looks like they missed they boat."
"397757","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",4,"This is a good phone, but if possible get yourself a Z3 Compact instead. Despite the spec sheets you will see that claim that Qualcomm's newer processor is faster than the one in the Z3, the Z5 runs notably slower and hotter. Not that the Z5 is slow, just that I had the Z3 for over a year without experiencing any of the tiny lag hiccups I get with the Z5, nor did I ever notice any heat coming off the Z3 despite its slimmer size. The heat in particular makes me nervous about how well the Z5 will stand the test of time. There are some very minor design elements that are nice on the Z5, like the matte finish on the back and the position of the buttons/ports, but in my opinion these features aren't worth the slight decrease you get in performance."
"397758","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",3,"Wanted a small phone to replace my note 5 which was not working properly. I was fed up with the top brands as they would not work properly. And so decided to try a different brand.This phone looks really nice and it was nice to have a small phone. It is light too. It is a tad thick if you are used to thin phones. I liked the way the home screen looks.I hated the home button being on the side but would have got used to it if i kept the phone. What was really annoying is that you had to press the home button to wake it up and then swipe up to get to how you want to unlock it. I set it to tap the screen twice to wake it up but most of the time it would not wake up and ended up using the home button. Swiping to switch the alarm off seemed to take forever and sometimes there was a delay in apps opening when you tapped them so I am assuming that the screen is not very responsive.I decided to return it after a few days as I didnt want to be left with another phone that does not, in my opinion work properly, especially for the price.I now have a $90 LG phone which works great. It wakes up every time I double tap it and swiping to turn off the alarm works first time every time too. I am really happy with it. I did originally buy the LG to tide me over whilst I saved up and take my time to decide which phone I want next as the last few have always been bought in haste to replace a faulty one. But I think I shall keep it for a while."
"397759","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",1,"Well, I liked it fine until May 31st: got up in the morning and the screen was all vertical stripes and I could not see anything on it. Am waiting to hear back from the manufacturer.Update (15 July): I mailed the phone back to Sony on 8 June, after a ridiculous series of e-mails, in which I was eventually instructed to hook up the phone to their Experia Companion software (which wiped the phone but did not fix my problem). Received numerous requests for feedback on the repair process, beginning June 15th (they had the phone still). On June 30, I got an e-mail from Sony telling me that they had repaired the phone, but could not prove I owned it, because it was Google Locked (untrue; as I said earlier, their software had wiped the phone). Sony would not accept my Amazon order confirmation as proof of purchase (and there was no receipt in the box when the phone came). Finally, I got the bright idea to photograph the side of the OEM box, and sent them that as proof. No word back from Sony, saying that they had received my photo, or that it was acceptable for their purposes.Sony e-mailed me another request for feedback on June 16, and again on July 8th. No word on the phone.I finally called today, and, after 10 minutes on hold, someone told me that the phone was ready to ship today. (I wonder if that would have been the answer yesterday, or last week-? Wish I'd called sooner.) The phone has been in Sony Repair's hands for as much time as I've had it in mine.I liked the phone fine before it broke, but based on Sony's ""customer service"" I would not get another Sony phone. I'd give the phone 4 stars, and ""service"" negative stars. Buyer beware!"
"397760","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",2,"This phone was supposed to be amazing. It's not been that for me and I have only had it since April and there is no return? It gets very hot. It just completely shut down when I plugged it in to charge at 40% and now it will not take a charge since I turned it back on... Slowly dying. It's often slow... Now what am I to do? Is there recourse? Repairs? Replacement? A different better phone? This was NOT a cheap phone. Help! If I am able to get good customer service perhaps my review will change. I'd be happy to do that. For now I am disappointed and soon to be without a phone! Bummer! What's the deal."
"397761","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",4,"Totally satisfied with this phone. Had considered an iPhone SE 6 because I wanted a smaller phone with modern specs, but glad I stumbled on this beauty instead (I'm generally turned off by Apple's closed systems, and I find Android more usable anyways. Also, I think 4.6"" is a sweet spot and 4"" probably too small).Pros:* It's the perfect size and super snappy* Camera is impressive, especially video recording* Love the button layout* Price is right* Good battery, charges quickly* Expandable storage, GSM unlocked, low on bloatware, etc.Cons:* US version fingerprint reader disabled (what's up with that?)* Screen is nice but not stunning. Bluish tint out of the box - but I was able to tweak RGB settings for better white balance* Cell-reception signal db readout seems inaccurate, but at least in a good way (even using 3rd party signal reading apps): often reports signal levels that should make reception bad or result in drop calls, but call reception is strong in reality. (note: I don't use LTE data for the most part, just old school cell phone calls / text + WiFi for data)."
"397762","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",4,"Good phone. Works well. Just a tad bit too little ram, and has an issue with Bluetooth devices."
"397763","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",5,"Upgraded from the Z3 Compact, please Sony, never stop making compact phones. I hate the bigger ones!! 720p on this screen looks crystal clear and is all you really need. It's a very powerful phone, no slow downs at all. It does get a little hot though, with a case I don't feel its heat as much. The removal of the flap that covered the USB port on the Z3 compact was a nice touch, although it does scare me that they decided to stop advertising taking it under water, not that I do that often."
"397764","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",4,"This is my first Android phone having been a long-time iPhone user (since Gen 1). I found the control to be intuitive and easy to figure out. There are a ton of apps on Google Play. The phone did not have too much bloatware and much of it is removable. I suggest that any user take extra time with the phone settings as there is quite a bit of personalization that you can do."
"397765","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",5,"It is better than I thought. The battery lasts long, the pictures I take with it are wonderful, great resolution."
"397766","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",5,"Great phone! Just like all the major reviews online say, if you're into a compact Android phone that delivers, this is it! Contrary to what other reviews say, this phone does have a finger print scanner. It works very well, quick and easy to use."
"397767","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",5,"Love the phone."
"397768","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",4,"Phone camera quality is excellent. Size great. No issues with apps and cell phone freezing"
"397769","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",5,"Very competent unit, I specially love the size and how it feels in the hand. My previous phone was a 5.1 inch unit, but somehow it just didn't feel right.I'm finding a few functions that work OK but not quite with the way I would expect, but this is more of a software issue. The hot battery hasn't been an issue with me. Overall, I'm quite happy I switched from the Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge. I'm now waiting in anticipation to the release of the 7.0 version (Nougat), expected as early as next month.By the way, after reading all the reviews, I congratulate myself in not buying the latest compact version, Xperia X. Most everyone says the Z5 Compact is a better phone."
"397770","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",4,"Love the size of this phone and it's definitely a powerhouse for being smaller. Camera takes amazing pictures as well. My only complaint is that this phone overheats very easily while playing games or even just checking Facebook or Snapchat. Aside from that, I would definitely recommend this phone."
"397771","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",2,"I love the hardware styling and size. Big plus for that. However, it just doesn't work effectively with Microsoft Exchange. Big lack of syncing with Contacts is unacceptable. Part of the value in being an Exchange Server user is that your email, calendar, and contacts reside there and are not dependent on your hardware for retention. But it IS dependent on your hardware for access, and this is where the Z5 Compact failed. This should be an OS problem and not associated with hardware, yet I've not had this problem with Sony phones in the past. Bottom line is I had to return it, and I hate that because I loved the phone (the actual handset). Luckily there's the newish, small iPhone SE, but that's not Android..."
"397772","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",3,"I bought the phone for it's compact size and nice camera. After playing with Android and disabling background servicing on most of my apps I did get the batter to last two days. The photos look great.However, the speaker you hold up to your ear to make a phone call failed after four months. I have not gotten it repaired even though it is under warranty because I read all the horror stories of people getting the phone back in pieces. Also, they do not make it easy to figure out how to return it.It seems like the second speaker might be starting to fail too, so at that point I will have to get it repaired."
"397773","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",5,"Good smartphone."
"397774","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",5,"Every friend who owns this phone loves it, and I can now say I agree.Affordable price, normal size, 2-day battery life (longer than competing Samsungs & iPhones), 4K display for awesome photos & videos (it is Sony after all), access to all the apps you could possibly want through Google Play store, waterproof properties (without making a big deal about it like some - ahem, Samsung, ahem) this phone has it all.Minor warning: U.S. version does NOT have finger print scanning! Not an issue for me, but if you want it, order a phone from Europe! ;-)"
"397775","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",5,"Great phone and I'm extremely happy with it."
"397776","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",1,"overheats incredibly even with minimal usage. This is absolutely ridiculous"
"397777","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",1,"First of all there are few choices in sub 5"" Android phones. And you probably already know why you use Android and won't switch to something else. So lets detail why you want this Android phone and not another:-It is very comfortable and has good weight in one hand-The call quality and microphones work really well (Okay google hotwords work with very very few failures)-The micro SD/SDXC/SDwhatever slot is a big deal. I put in a 200GB card and don't think about storage anymore.-The battery life is good enough if you have a strong data signal on Marshmallow-Marshmallow was available as soon as I turned it on. Upgrade available!-Limited skinning on the OS. Coming from a Nexus and later two Moto phones, I like stock android.-Contrary to many reviews I think the camera is excellent. When I use mine next to my wife's iPhone 6s she says my photos always look better. That may be because I switch to manual and use exposure compensation on most every image.-4K video is gorgeous and plays well on this tiny, low res screen. I was surprised it played at all.-Signal strength. I haven't dropped a call or failed a text on AT&T or T-Mo in 2 months. And my area has bad signal. Even when LTE says no bars I can get good speeds.-I think the speakers are very good for watching videos. I often run at half volume and that's enough. Little to no distortion.-Waterproof. Or is it? I showered with it and its fine. I dunked it in water. I washed it off. I dry after each time but that hot shower for the length of a YouTube video should be some kind of standard test.The not so good points I found were-Disabled fingerprint reader being that this is the US version. I use my Pebble watch as my ""trusted device"" so I don't mind this.-The screen is not as pretty as an OLED. Moto X 2013 had a 4.7"" OLED screen that I prefer to this one. Better blacks and better battery life.-The camera... I wan't a raw file format. Sony being an imaging company can do better.-The price. I guess I want better specs for this price after I've been spoiled by Motorola's deals or the Nexus phones. I haven't paid this much for a phone since my iPhone 3G S. I certainly could have gotten a Z3C for less but since my Moto X 2014 has similar specs and is struggling at times to keep up with basic apps I figured the Z3C would have similar issues. So I got the updated model.-I hear it overheats. I shot HD video for 10 minutes without issue. I charge and it gets hot but no noticeable issue. I'm no power user. I have no games installed. I cannot confirm any heat problems.Disappointing problems are-Battery life in poor signal area. I live in the suburbs and my LTE coverage is GARBAGE. Moto says 1 bar, Apple says 1 circle?, Sony says 0 bars. More on the disparity later. I would be at 20% by lunch until I made some changes. At work the battery lasted until dinner without using battery saving apps.-Doze replaced Stamina mode? With Marshmallow Stamina mode is gone (rumored to be returning as of May 2016) and the battery life is pretty bad without doing some homework. The Doze function only works if you don't jostle your phone so put it down and ignore it.-Low reported signal strength. Look up what signal db translates to bars and you'll see a -74db signal is full bars. To this phone its 0 bars.At home. At the gym -80db is full bars again. You cannot trust the signal strength meter and I can't figure out why. Neither could Sony support. So -110db should be 0 bars, -83db is full bars and you can figure out what is in between. I can't figure this one out. However, its signal (when looking at -db) is on par with the iPhone 6s and Moto X 2013 and 2014, all of which are known for having great radios.How to fix your problems:-Install Greenify, enable all the permissions it asks for and Hibernate just about everything (I think that helps). Enable agressive Doze (that really helps). Greenify will make Doze (the function not the app) useful and make that battery history graph go sideways instead of a sharp slope.-Its slippery. I knew this ahead of time and got a ""Cruzerlite Bugdroid Circuit Case Compatible for Sony Xperia Z5 Compact"" and am very happy with the grip, plus it slides less and I've had a few drops with no damage. I'm not saying its the most attractive case but I have a small phone that I'm not worried about being rough with.If I missed anything or if you have any questions, fire away. Its still not perfect but if they bring back Stamina mode I think it'll be nearly so.45 day update: I've flashed the phone three times as recommended by Sony and the forums and I can't seem to get a handle on battery life. Sometimes I'm losing 1% per minute with the phone doing nothing (Google Play Services wakelock issue) even after restarts, and some days I can get though most of the day without charging. Add to that that the 4k video function only shoots for 1-3 minutes before the camera app shuts down (@115 degrees F on the back). And Sony's response to this is give us the phone and we'll have it back in 3 weeks or so. 14 business days, 2 weeks and 4 days, is their solution. I miss Motorola's loaner phone program where they'd give you a backup until they fix your phone. Free. Performance is getting very slow and I imagine its the processor getting too hot and slowing the system down. I'm worried but too far out of warranty to get a different phone at this point. I can't tell you what TO get but I can tell you what NOT TO GET.RETURN FROM REPAIRS UPDATE: They apparently lost my phone in repair for a month. I called again and all they could say is the phone had been ""scrapped."" In their warranty they say they can return your phone in pieces and its not their problem anymore. I told Amazon and they said send us the pieces and we'll refund you. I told Sony to send me the pieces so I can be refunded and they sent a replacement phone. It seems the problems (aside from it not being water resistant) stemmed from it having Android 6.0 as it doesn't overheat and crash the camera until about 15 minutes in. Stamina mode, the thing that makes the battery so good, exists so long as I don't update the OS. It still bugs me to update to 6.0 over and over and Sony says the only way to get rid of the constant popup is to do it, therefore ruining the phone. I rooted it (to allow me to stop the Sony Update app) and it works okay but that is not a solution unless you're very tech savy. Right now Youtube stopped working since rooting and I'm diagnosing that. Of course I have no warranty now because I rooted. I still can't identify a better choice but don't get this if you want Marshmallow. Don't get this if you don't want to turn down an update multiple times a day (I read days later you can adb into the phone to stop the updater without root). Don't get this if you want a phone with a warranty or customer service. Don't get this."
"397778","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",1,"It is overheated without install all apps"
"397779","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",4,"I did my research before deciding on this phone, and I feel satisfied with my purchase. Some things about the user interface *could* be better, but that's true of any device, probably. Hmm... If you don't wanna be seen lugging around some ridiculously over-sized phone, well, this is the one for you. That was the *main* draw for me, although that's not all that this phone has going for it. Do your own research."
"397780","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",2,"Be forewarned. This phone, as nice as it is, heats up. Install some apps, browse some sites, and you can feel the back getting uncomfortably hot. Not scorching. You can still hold it. But it did cause some concern.Consider the Nexus 5X, instead. A little bigger, sure, but IMO it's the better buy."
"397781","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",5,"I got this phone due to the compact form factor and that it keeps as many ""flagship"" specs as possible. Battery life is not noticeable short or long and that's good enough for me. I do Clash Royale and Clash of Clans for a few hours each day on it and long stretches can make the phone hot, but not too hot to hold. Many times I'll game for 45+ mins at a time and the heat is not that bad. Camera is great! Fast autofocus and great quality for a smartphone. Placement of the physical shutter button is great if you're taking selfies...not that I do.Answer to the million dollar question... Yes, I would buy it again."
"397782","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",5,"This is a super phone in a compact form factor which the same as the new iphone is trying to do.Excellent battery and picture quality. Some people may say screen is not great, but I like it a lot. Colors are great."
"397783","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",1,"Bad quality of this product.When I was talking get very hot.When trying to talk with some friends using Whatssap was impossible because an horrible noise came up!!Fortunately I get my money back because is expensive. I was willing to pay that much because I was expecting a very good quality smart phone."
"397784","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",5,"This was the ONLY viable option to replace my aging Moto X (1st Edition). I refuse to upsize to anything bigger than a 4.7"" screen. I want to be able to hold my phone and text with one (and the same) hand. Other than the older Iphones and the Moto E, nothing else fits that form factor.My Z5 Compact came with Android 5.1, but I received the Marshmallow upgrade a few weeks ago.The color is not ""black"", but more what I believe should be called ""Gun Metal Gray""The fit and finish are excellent, though the back of phone has a hard slick plastic feel, and as such I also purchased a ] because of the slippery feel to it. Mind you, I use a belt case and reach in one handed to grab my phone and use. I was used to the very ""grippy"" feel of the rubber backed Moto X I had owned for almost 2 and 1/2 years.Camera is great, but not all that important to me. It didn't take long at all to adjust to the placement of the On/Off and Volume buttons.The phone has operated flawlessy for as long as I have had it. It has snappy performance for me, I do not play games or use it for music.There are a few SONY apps that are not removable, but no where near as bad as on SAMSUNG phones."
"397785","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",3,"It's a good enough phone for all the reasons everyone else has listed. But before you buy it you should know two things.1. There is no fingerprint scanner on the US version of this phone.2. If you use T-Mobile, you will not be able to use the WiFi Calling or WiFi Texting features for which T-mobile makes themselves famous. This option is not installed on the unlocked phone (and T-Mobile doesn't sell this phone, so you're just plain out of luck). If you go to the Sony Xperia US support website, it contains instructions for how to enable WiFi calling on your Xperia, but this is misleading. Again, this phone cannot do WiFi calling."
"397786","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",1,"Update 8/8/16. Although my initial review was quite positive, that didn't last long. 3 months after purchasing, I got a teeny-tiny crack in one of the corners. A week later, the entire operating system failed. I sent to Sony Repair, received it back about a month later, With a one-sentence explanation that phone was irreparable, and not covered under the warranty. They sent me back the phone, which is useless,Other issues I found before the phone went kaput.-Glass is weak-Wifi issues galore. Not only for me, but other uses in Sony Z5 forums.-Runs hot. Another well-known issue documented.**DONT BUY THIS PHONE $400+ down the drain***I have small hands for a woman, and there isn't a lot of options out there at the moment for compact cells. For me, its major factor when purchasing a phone. Performance-wise, I have only had the Xperia Z5 Compact for a week now, but so far its been excellent! Only complaint is its availability! I waivered about buying this phone - because so far Sony only offers this phone online.. Only Amazon, Best Buy, and B&H websites. There is ZERO brick and mortar stores selling this phone. I was very hesitant to purchase an expensive phone without being able to view & try it in-person. Maybe I'm old-school, but that's how I roll :) I finally took the plunge after hearing Sony's future nextgen cells, Xa's, wont have a compact option available. No regrets on my purchase though. Superfast, and haven't run into any bugs. Upgraded itself immediately from Lollipop to Marshmellow. Battery is great compared to my old Moto X. Lasted about a day and a half with moderate use."
"397787","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",5,"I accidentally broke my Z3 Compact. I bought this as a replacement. I just love the Sony feel and finish. It's fast and convenient to use outdoors since it is waterproof."
"397788","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",5,"Perfect"
"397789","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",1,"This phone has been the worst phone I have ever had. I got it because I don't like how other phones have been getting bigger. The first problem I had with it are that there are no flip cases for it. Fine - that is a preference I have - I get that maybe I will have to settle for the case. Then I get my sim card in it. Now it always say Cell Information as a notification (ALWAYS). I tell myself: I spent good money on this phone. It can't be that bad. I can deal with a simple notification that there is no way to get rid of.Last night was the kicker. The emergency alert system went off 4 times as I was trying to sleep. Now my phone was on vibrate with Do Not Disturb. It was so loud it woke up the neighbors. So in the middle of the night when anyone who has to work the next day should be able to rest, I was instead looking at any forum posts of how to disable it or turn it off or anything. Guess what - there is no way. I called my cell carrier. I called Sony Support. They all say the same thing. There is no way to get rid of it or to get it to be quiet.So sure - if you never go anywhere where you need your phone to be silent (the movies, an office, the doctors, a funeral) and you can let it go off whenever it wants - feel free to get this phone. I will say one thing about it - it is smaller than some out there."
"397790","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",1,"It looked excellent when I received it at the begining. However, after 3 months, the touch screen doesn't work well. And the camera runs worse and worse."
"397791","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",5,"good price, received ok."
"397792","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",5,"The Xperia had a lot of complaints about how hot it gets. This was an issue before I did all the updates. So I imagine this was an issue with the original roll out. As of now I am very happy with it. The UI is very sharp and clean. I was a galaxy S3 and then S5 user. The Galaxy phones really are great but the trend toward bigger and bigger is just too much. I think the S3 dimensions were perfect but you can no longer get a galaxy at a reasonable size. So I'm making the switch and so far so good. I'll update this review in a few months. I hope in a few years when I am looking to upgrade again there are still offerings like the Sony Xperia. I'm happy to see there are good options out there."
"397793","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",4,"This is honestly a great phone. I didn't keep it but got a pretty good deal with Warehouse Deals on it, so I tried it out. Unfortunately the phone I received had some physical damage I didn't like on it, but I tested the phone anyway just to see if it was worth replacing it for another one. It runs Android Marshmallow and has a nice screen. The phone is light and has a pretty great battery which lasts a long time as far as Android phones go. The camera is just OK, and for having so many megapixels, it doesn't seem like the sensor is really that great. The phone charges quick and calls work well. The phone gets a bit too hot for my liking with the Snapdragon 810, and it comes with a lot of extra Sony bloatware which was really a turnoff. I am an iPhone user and compared this to my SE, and this phone offered me nothing outside of a bigger screen that the SE didn't already have. Before my SE I was an Android user and thought maybe I was missing out on the Z5, but after trying it, it made me miss my SE more for doing everything very very well, where the Z5 really offers a good battery and great form factor, but does everything else at an average or below-average level. I'd recommend this phone to those who want a smaller form factor, and do not want to switch to an iPhone 6s or SE, but if you are willing to jump ship, I believe Apple devices offer far better value in the ~4.6"" screen size class. If you want to stay with Android there are other phones which can offer a good value in the ~5"" arena, but far fewer that tick all the flagship boxes like the Z5 does."
"397794","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",5,"my friend it loving this"
"397795","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",4,"Yes the Sony Xperia z5 Compact is a great phone.I have but one complaint. The US version, which is what you're getting here, has the fingerprint scanner disabled.I can live without it, but I'd like it enabled for use."
"397796","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",1,"I didn't get headphone with this phone"
"397797","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",1,"Phone noticeably heats up within a few minutes of browsing, updates, etc. Such a crappy phone! Why did the company even released a defect? No wonder Sony is in the dump."
"397798","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",5,"The Battery Life is absolutely amazing! For the first time, I own a phone that I will not be plugging in every night as I crawl into bed.(Oh, and the display and performance are great as well, of course."
"397799","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",5,"Great compact phone. Wanted a smaller phone as I dislike the trend towards oversized phones which I find awkward to hold or carry around. Am not using it to watch movies or play video intensive games. Runs a little hot sometimes and camera is very good, but not great (my prior phone was a Nokia Lumia). Other than that, no complaints. Runs smoothly, with excellent web browser and no crapware to be removed. Doesn't have the UI bells and whistles of my prior Windows 10 Mobile, but at least has real apps that I can run. Battery life has been remarkable. Usage that would run my prior phone out now uses about 20% of battery. If you want a good compact phone, this is it."
"397800","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",5,"Design: Beautiful phone! Love the front and back surfaces; it's isn't cheap plastic. Easy access to the SD and SIM slots.Size: Personally, I still find this compact size still a bit big but it's manageable.Apps: Yes, all manufacturers include their own apps but the amount included isn't overwhelming. There is nothing that forces you to use use the Sony apps; I just default to Google apps; I think others may have opened up the apps. Many of the included non-sony apps could be deleted. Navigation is very smooth. Not sure what emails a previous reviewer is talking about; I didn't receive a single email from Sony.Battery life: I've used Sony's stamina mode on another Sony phone and like how this one has lots more options. For example, you can select which apps has data access while your phone is on standby. Battery life is great with basic stamina mode; it may be able to last a week. There's been complaints that the phone runs hot so that was one of my concerns about this phone but during the download/installation of all the apps I use while using GPS, the phone was barely warm to the touch.I use mine on T-Mobile's network and haven't had an issue. Places where I could previously access the network still works; places where I previously could not, I still can't."
"397801","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",1,"I really want to like this phone. It's beautiful. I can use it one handed. It fits into my front pocket. It's got a great battery life. It supposedly has an incredible camera (yet to be tested). But then I start using it... and almost immediately forget all the reasons I like it and get really angry at Sony for ruining such a beautiful phone with such crummy software.The software experience is a nightmare... the phone thermal throttles like crazy. The UI is super laggy. I've had the phone 1 day and starting the camera can take up to 15 seconds. Sony has managed to pack so much bloatware onto a phone so small that it blows my mind.While going through and trying to ""disable"" - because you can't uninstall - the garbage (e.g. augmented reality camera plugin - who the hell wants a 1980s style 3D dinosaur in their picture?), I had to stop and just contemplate that some pencil d*ck project manager approved sticking 500 useless apps - some that half-assingly replicate default Android behavior - on this phone for apparently no reason other than ""screw it.. why not?!?"". WHY SONY?! WHY DO YOU DO THIS TO US?!?I can keep going on and on.. the absolutely useless ""small apps"" that you can't completely disable.. the Sony photo album app that breaks the camera app if disabled.. there's just so much bad about the software experience that it makes me regret buying this phone.It really makes me even more sad that Sony hasn't pushed Android 6.x to this phone. It's been 6 months since Google released it.. and supposedly Sony has addressed some of the issues mentioned above in their Android 6.x OS. But for now, it's not here and all I have is this nightmare. This phone should be a no go for anyone looking for a compact phone. The software is just too bad to use on a daily basis. There's no excuse for it.Sony.. your phone is bad. And you should feel bad.** UPDATE **Feb 15: the phone is going back. Summary: beautiful phone ruined by crap software experience. For those reading the comments to this review... finding a replacement ROM and then loading on this phone is next to impossible. If you side load a ROM, you lose the DRM camera software and there's more challenges beyond that. Not worth it. Not worth it at all."
"397802","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",5,"The phone does what it needs to do."

"397804","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",4,"I want to write an update for this phone. I now had this phone for 8 months. The marshmallow update 6.0.1 fixed all of the cons of this phone. Phone does get warm to the touch but that is during heavy usage. This happens when you spend 2 hours streaming or playing games and the battery drops down to 10%. You then plug it in to charge and resume your constant streaming and games.The phone does get slow when you have like 10 apps running at once. But that's with every phone. What I did enjoy was some photos i took underwater. See Photos. I really enjoy how it is somewhat water proof. Please know that it was under water for maybe less than 20 seconds.__________________________________________________________I just recently bought this phone 7 days ago. The shipping was prompted and the item looked well. This phone is really good but once the memory usage gets past 80 percent, it lags. If you are going to buy this phone, take out all the preinstalled app you wont be using and only install apps you will be using on a regular basis. It worked better after i got my memory uses below 70%"
"397805","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",5,"So I have been waiting for this phone to be available for a LONG time and am so glad it stands up to virtually all my expectations. If only they could have made it a LITTLE smaller!So the first thing I want to note is that this DOES indeed work with Tmobile with no manual setup or configuration - I just went into the Tmobile store, told them I have a phone I want to activate, they gave me the nano-SIM which I put in, turned the phone on and everything worked including MMS messages - super simple!I tested Internet speed while cell reception was on 2 out of 4 bars LTE, and was getting an average of 4 Mbps.Even though T-Mobile's wifi calling won't work, I just installed the updated hangouts dialer app and I'm all set to make calls when off-network and on only wifi from my free Google number.I don't have very big hands, but can still hold use this with only one hand which is my main objective, and it looks great too! Front speakers are great and you can really tell the difference in sound when you turn the phone sideways and allow your ears to pick up the stereo effect.In regards to the camera, the automatic mode is great. However the maximum advertised resolution for both the front and back cameras is only achieved in 4:3, not 16:9 to match the wide screen, though 16:9 is available with slightly smaller resolutions.Battery life is great with stamina mode - after a full day of being connected to my Bluetooth and typical handful of calls and several texts though leaving Internet off, I got home at 5:30 with still 93% remaining!No overheating issues as some have mentioned - it was barely even warm after playing a graphically intense game for over 20 minutes +Overall very happy with this phone, and I have high hopes for durability."
"397806","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",5,"works well. beautiful device. too bad Sony doesn't market it well over here in US. And also too bad it took forever to get US version. But a great Android phone, great quality. Awesome battery life!"
"397807","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",1,"It worked great for one month and since then has only been s***ier. After bad, it gets worse and worse. Among the main problems there is that keys keep being pressed while locked (for example in your pocket) so every time you need it your phone you need to go through an identification process because it thinks you have been trying to enter the passcode too many times. It is also super slow and crashes all the time. I never had a phone as bad as this one. I think its gold reviews are probably based on the initial experience which, as I said, is not bad but quickly goes downhill."
"397808","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",5,"good phone"
"397809","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",5,"I'm a former iPhone 5 owner and I bought this phone because I wanted an android smartphone with the same compact form factor, without sacrificing the features I'd gotten used to. The Xperia z5 compact is slightly taller and wider than the iPhone 5, but still very easy to use with one hand (the same can't be said for most other smartphones on the market!)The build quality of this phone feels great - it's got a slick glass body with a hard plastic bumper around the edge. The phone is water-resistant while still leaving the headphone and microUSB charging ports uncovered, which is a nice upgrade from the previous model (Z3 compact). Note that the phone is rated to be dust and water resistant, but not completely waterproof - Sony will not guarantee protection from activities like taking photos underwater. While I would've liked to be able to take my phone swimming with me, it's nice to know it'll hold up to rain, sweat and spills that could damage most other devices. The only flap on the phone's body covers the SIM card tray and SD card slot, but it's not a major inconvenience as you shouldn't need to access these often. It's tempting to carry this phone with no case but I'm cautious with glass-backed phones so I purchased a cheap TPU case for it in case I drop it and it hasn't been a huge compromise, it's still very pocketable. The power button, volume controls and camera button are all along the right side of the phone - another reason I like having a case on this phone is that it's possible to trigger the camera button accidentally if you aren't used to a hardware camera button.The 23 megapixel camera was one of the main selling points for me, and it's by far the best camera I've had on a smartphone! The hardware button is convenient for capturing photos quickly, although the camera interface takes a little longer to capture photos than the one built into iOS. The automatic camera settings do a decent job at capturing most photos, but if you'd like more custom options a fully manual mode is available with the swipe of a finger, along with a slew of presets for different subject matter. I replaced the stock camera app with an open source alternative because it's a little bit faster and compatible with some other apps I've installed on my phone.I've seen people complaining about bloatware, but in my experience just about every smartphone comes with some pre-installed apps. At least most of the pre-installed apps on the Xperia z5 Compact can be deleted, unlike Apple's stock apps (which I always end up putting in a folder out of my way, where they still take up precious memory). This phone comes with a generous 32gb of storage on board, but can be expanded up to an additional 200gb with a microSD card. Out of the pre-installed apps there were a few I found useful, including Sony's lifelog app, which acts as an activity counter and lets you compare your physical activity with smart detection of walking, biking or time spent in a car - as well as the activities you use your phone for, such as web browsing, gaming and listening to music. The 4.6"" 720p screen might not be the best on the market for gaming or viewing media, but the on board speakers impressed me compared to most other phones I've used, and screen size is a compromise I'm willing to make for a phone so small. Also packaged on board is Sony's Playstation remote play app, which allows Playstation 4 owners to play Playstation games on their phone. I can't speak to how well this works because I don't own the console, but I haven't experienced any lag so far playing mobile games on this phone (although the handset will heat up a little during more graphically intense titles).Overall, the Z5 compact has given me everything I want out of a smartphone during the first couple of weeks I've owned it, but I will update this review if I run into any issues. If you're looking for a small but powerful android phone that will survive daily life and occasional accidents, this is the one!"
"397810","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",3,"No not really."

"397812","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",5,"I'm happy I upgraded from Nexus 5.Waterproof and good camera will allow me to retire my Panasonic TS3. This will reduce number of devices I pack and eliminate the need for taking a TS3 picture for quality and a phone picture for public WiFi email."
"397813","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",3,"Great form factor, battery life, and performance. Kinda sucks that they dropped the magnetic charging pins from the Z3C. And it's a bit offensive that they blow away their DRM keys when you unlock the bootloader."
"397814","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",5,"Sony Xperia z5 Compact is the ONLY small size smartphone with true premium specs. It is way above and beyond the competition. I'm not going to go over phone's features in this review as they are all well discussed in many publications. I do want to comment on 3 features the phone has been critised for unfairly in my opinion: First is the price - some critics say it is too expensive. Give me a break! The phone costs $450 plus $40 you have to shell out for 128GB SD card. That is $500. Compare that to iPhone 6s or Samsung Galaxy 6s with 128GB at $850 & $900 respectively and you will realize that Sony phone is a bargain. And that is comparing apples to apples because Sony phone is surely on par features and quality wise with both Apple & Samsung. The second point of criticism is the lack of 1080p HD screen. Again give me a break! On 4.6"" screen you will NEVER notice the difference between 720 and 1080p resolution no matter how good your eyesight is. And finally the lack of fingerprint sensor on us version (it is available on the international version). In opinion of many experts in the field the fingerprint technology is not mature enough especially both security and reliability wise. Most importantly it takes me virtually the same time to unlock the phone with a 4 digit code as with a fingerprint scanner - I tested it many times on my wife's iPhone 6s. So get over it or get an international model if you can't. Thank you Sony for the awesome phone!"
"397815","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",5,"great"
"397816","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",2,"I really wanted to like this phone. On paper, it had all the specifications I wanted. Unfortunately the overheating issues are true. On just the setup of the phone, it started warming up and became hot to touch. I can't imagine holding this up to my face or trying to hold it for extended amounts of time. It's a bummer because I haven't found another compact phone of this size with the features this one had.If you aren't bothered by a hot phone, then this is a great phone. Otherwise this is not the phone you are looking for."
"397817","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",5,"Very good everything worked as expected ! Phone was unlocked with full LTE coverage."
"397818","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",5,"Gréta:)"
"397819","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",3,"This is our families' 5th Xperia phone. The phone itself is the very best we've owned. Only drawback is the extremely poor customer service and long repair times if service is required. Any form of repair by Sony will cost at least a month without your phone and it is impossible to contact their repair facility. Would give a five start rating to each of the Xperia phones we've owned if Sony had better repair service. I miss the magnetic charging port on previous models."
"397820","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",5,"Very good phone for less money"

"397822","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",5,"Excellent Phone"
"397823","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",2,"I purchased this phone due to the higher end specs of the phone in the smaller form factor. At first I was disappointed to learn that they removed the fingerprint reader from the power button, but I quickly got over that since I hadn't had it yet in my prior phones. Overall I enjoyed the phone at first. The form factor was good along with several other aspects. I didn't appreciate all of the Sony specific software that was on it, but I was able to overlook that for a while. Within a few months though I started having issues such as the phone running slowly, apps crashing, and the phone running hot due to apps continually running. I also had issues with connectivity with using T-Mobile and by using a phone that they're not used to it seemed to complicate things. I ended up getting a Google Pixel lately which was a huge improvement."
"397824","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",5,"Excellent phone"
"397825","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",5,"Great compact size phone, good battery life"
"397826","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",5,"It does get hot, but meh, get off your phone after using it. Enjoy life. It does perform really well though for games and such. Also it's a neat little phone for its size."
"397827","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",4,"This is a great phone if you're looking for the 4.7 inch range in a flagship smartphone and not wanting an iPhone! If I could, I would give this product 4.5/5 stars as that is more accurate for me.I think Sony did a great job with this phone. The camera is excellent, with my only gripe about it being that they should have spent more time optimizing it so that it launches more quickly. It still launches quickly, but it's just not quite as snappy as, say, a Galaxy S7 camera. Still quick to snap though. The dedicated camera button is also an EXCELLENT feature. Very useful for when you're trying to really get a good focus on a picture.My second gripe is that, when you connect headphones or an aux cable to this device, this little thing pops up MULTIPLE times that says ""Improve your headphone experience"" in the notifications bar. This is no big deal to me, EXCEPT for the fact that it pauses whatever video/media you're trying to play! It does this about 5 times, and then it stops. I CAN'T disable this, I have looked around for hours in settings as well as on forums. It is a bug that Sony needs to fix, and I hate it!The only other minor gripe is that the phone is just barely not as snappy as I would expect from a flagship spec'd phone such as this. What I mean by this is that sometimes apps just take a split second too long to switch between and it can be slightly annoying if I'm trying to go fast. This is a minor gripe, however, and not something that would make me reconsider my decision to purchase or recommend this phone.Overall, I really like this phone and it is so nice to be able to use it one-handed. It actually makes my job much easier if I'm using my phone while running an experiment (i.e. looking at a protocol, running a quick calculation, etc.) I purchased this phone through Amazon's warehouse deals, and while the packaging came pretty meh, the phone itself was PERFECT. Not a single flaw that I could perceive, and I got it for $100 less than retail. No warranty, but I've never needed to use it on any of the 5 cell phones I've had. It's only a 1 year warranty anymore on most phones anyway."
"397828","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",5,"great phone,no over heating problems. had the z3 phone,liked it a lot too. cracked the bace being in my rear pocket.like that this has a different back."
"397829","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",1,"This phone has many great features and was exactly the size I was looking for. I was pleased with many parts of this phone. However, hardware failures and a even worse experience with dealing with this customer service for warranty work leaves me wanting to list 0 stars. -5 stars.Within six months, the camera sensor died. Total failure. Call the warranty service department and find that I must ship the phone, at my own cost, to a service center for at least 21 businesses days. ( This means a month). When it is returned after a month, the camera works but now has a blue glow added in all pictures with a flash. Secondly, now I cannot talk on the handset because the ear speaker doesn't work anymore. Call warranty service again. They want me to pay to ship it to them for another month. I complained to manager , Cedric. He assured me that he would be personally finding me another solution within 24 hours. That was there days ago. No word, no email, no call.I owned this phone since March 2016, broke in September 2016, returned October 2016 broken, and will likely be sent back again and kept until December.They should sell this phone as a two pack because it breaks down and the service is so poor you will need to buy another phone to cover while it is being serviced.Bottom line: great phone until something breaks. And several things will. Buy anything else."

Sony support is absolutely useless. I'll keep my cover on and hope it doesn't fail on me"
"397834","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",5,"I used to have the European version of the phone and I really loved it. I had a problem with the camera and couldn't fix it, so I decided to get the US version because I love the compact size and the processing power that comes with it."
"397835","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",2,"It's a great phone functionally, but whatever material they use for the screen will spontaneously decide to crack on you at some point. When that crack occurs, you will lose most or all touch functionality on your phone. If the crack happens to occur after a drop, no matter how slight or soft, Sony will refuse to cover it under warranty. Essentially, Sony is under the impression that an accidental drop is automatically ""misuse,"" despite the fact that I am not aware of a single person who has never dropped a mobile phone.I could swallow Sony's miserliness if it weren't for the fact that you can't even use your phone when the screen cracks. It is not purely cosmetic. Once your phone cracks, you MUST pay for a repair or buy a new phone as you lose all touch functionality on the phone. I don't know of any other line of phones that does this and I have only ever seen this problem with the Xperia line of phones. In fact, my previous phone was an Xperia Z2 Compact and I purchased the Z5 Compact after that phone had a screen crack that caused a cascading series of problems. Suffice to say, as much as I like the Sony line of phones, I will not purchase another anytime soon.UPDATE:To add salt into the wound, Sony is currently refusing to do even out of warranty repairs, meaning I'm stuck with either a broken phone or paying $145 for a repair at a local shop that cannot maintain the IP68 standard."
"397836","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",4,"Excellent!"
"397837","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",5,"I've been looking for a while for a small phone with good specs. This is exactly what I was looking for. There are zero other options if you want a phone this small with decent specs, storage, and Android Marshmallow. I have big hands, but the interface is smooth and easy to use. It isn't a ""small"" screen - it's what would have been considered a normal sized screen five years ago. It's solid feeling, gets good signal strength compared to my wife's iPhone, has a good battery life (with moderate use and no daytime charging I usually have 50% battery at the end of the day). The speakers sound decent when listening to music. Not superb, but much better than a lot of other phones and tablets I've used. Very usable for watching shows or movies using the built in speakers.High temperatures fixed: When it came in the mail, it had Lollipop installed. After the setup process, it felt quite hot. However, I then immediately did the over-the-air software upgrades. There were three updates in a row: The first an upgrade to Marshmallow, and then two more incremental upgrades / bug fixes. After those upgrades, it has never gotten hot again. A little warm, but comparable to any other phone I've ever used.You can uninstall or disable most of the Sony bloatware pretty easily, with the only exception being this What's Up app that was telling me about random celebrity birthdays and crap like that in the notifications. I got it to shut up and go away by disabling its data privileges.The camera is AMAZING. There is a built-in camera button, which I love. It has a two-level press like a real camera: soft press to focus, and hard press to snap photos. I wish the lens wasn't right on the corner though - I'm always sticking my finger in front of it by accident.My primary complaint is that I wish there was a hardware button bar at the bottom, so that the buttons (back, home, etc) didn't take up screen real estate. I guess that's a minor complaint though. I'm getting used to it, and they hide during videos or gaming.Note: if you want to use OTG devices, it isn't automatic. You have pull down and hit a button to attach OTG stuff. A little annoying, but if you're plugging in wired stuff to the mirco USB plug, you're not really expecting fast convenience anyway."
"397838","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",4,"nice cell phone the only details its the finger detector. doesn't work because the phone it's from the us and in that region its not compatible"
"397839","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",5,"Wow, what a great phone. I've never seen such stunning video quality on the phone. Just FYI my work phone is an iphone 6s.We got this for my husband unlocked to use on Tmobile. The sound is very very clear no issues there. Reception is great. Everything is fine.The camera quality is better than any other phone i've seen. No complaints so far.The phone size is just perfect. seems like every other phone company gets bigger can't even fit in the pocket but this one does!.One thing to note, didn't realize it only uses nano sim card. One quick trip to tmobile to upgrade old sim card. They come in 3 -1 now. So you can choose your size.Sony in my opinion has the best phones out on the market. Its too bad they didnt pick up the US, but i'm so happy they sell them unlocked for all of us in the states."

"397841","Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)",1,"I want to love this phone, but it overheats in 15 minutes after doing practically anything.A lot of the overheating can be delayed by uninstalling or disabling the Sony bloat apps. Unfortunately, the X-Mobile display enhancement adds to the overhead and when it's turned off, causes a lot of stuttering to go away.I was ready to live with the problems because of the beautiful case and size, but it's impossible. The overheating causes stuttering in the daily use after about 10 to 15 minutes of use.I think the only thing that could save this phone is a CPU throttling, but I just don't want to do that for a phone of this expense.REVISED: I lowered the star by one due to seller concern."

"397907","Sony Xperia Z5 E6653 32GB 5.2-inch 4G LTE Factory Unlocked International Stock No Warranty (Pink)",5,"Alright so after about a full month of using, I think I'm ready for a review now. First of all let me note that I use a E6683(Dual SIm) and its from Hong Kong. The first thing I will say is YES the LTE does work in the US, be it T-mobile or AT&T actually any GSM carrier will do.Screen• The screen is really sharp even though it's just a 1080p, thanks to it X-reality. However if you were to compare this to a Galaxy S6 or any smartphone with a AMOLED display, I would say the AMOLED does produce more vibrant color. Pixel vise I highly doubt anyone can tell the different unless you hold the very very close to your eyes (which of course, not a lot of people will do that). I do think that reading on the Z5 is more comfortable thoughSound• Sony has a lot of commercial regarding about their ""Hi-res"" music and ""Hi-res"" player and I think they are right. The stereo front speaker is nice since you will rarely block it but don't get your hope on it since its not really that loud. I mean you wouldn't want to use it as an entertain system with a lot of people anyway. Next the headphone, I've seen a lot of review saying the sound quality isn't as good as the other smartphone out there, in this case I will have to take a different ground. I own a Sony MDR-1ADAC and the sound is amazing when pair with the Z5. I tried compare with it Galaxy S6 and to me I feel like there is clearly different quality in music. On the down side, you are require to have a Hi-res music quality otherwise the quality isn't that . . . .Performance• ""SoC 810 does it overheat ?"" my answer is ""It really depend"" If you're recording a 4K video then yes it will definitely heat up but so does the other smartphone. Gaming vice I think the Z5 is doing fantastic, the Z5 can run any game so far that I tried smoothly. It does though lag sometime when it heats up (rarely, like 1% ) and has low battery mode is activate. It definitely run smoother than my HTC oneM9+ haha.• Now everyday uses such as email, texting, web surfing, all of these are buttery smooth. In fact I would say any flagship is the same in this area, unless you came from an IOS which is a lot heck smoother.Camera• That hybrid focus ! Yes it focus really fast BUT it take like a WHILE to processing the image. If you came from a Galaxy S6 or even from an Iphone 5 you will notice a substantial different in time. Iphone took a picture in like a blink of an eye, while S6 is a little slower than that but still in a blink of an eye. But for the Z5 its like 1-2 second on camera processing after picture was taken which can be huge deal if you really need to get that picture. I would say the Z5 is more like a digital camera since it be ""hit"" then done. The image quality though I would say the Z5 is better compare to the S6 or Iphone 6 but its not really a by a big margin though. Also if you really want to take a professional picture, then any smartphone wouldn't do as of now. Overall I wouldn't sacrifice the 1-2 second for a little better camera, but if you can live with that, then I would just say go ahead.• Front camera is okay but wouldn't say it's the best out there in the market compare to like a selfie centred phone. It does produce a satisfy result though.Software• If you like Stock-Android then you will probably like this too. It ran almost identical to stock android except with the small app. There's a bloatware but you can un-install it or just disable it. The finger print scanner on this phone is superb, its super and way more accurate than the Iphone 6 or even the S6 (at least to me).• This is for people who has a PS4 and want it to use for a remote play. It work technically but don't expect the same experience from the TV also a good internet connection is require to a smooth remote play too. Unless you want to connect you Z5 to a Lan cable, which work haha (I did that :D)• The battery on this phone is last longing, you can expect a whole day or more with this phone. The charging is quite slow to me though even with the Qualcomm quick charge 2.0 but maybe I was just used to a tiny battery of an Iphone 6 and S6.Phone• The phone also come with expandable storage which could give you an 32GB boost in less than $50• The water proof and dust proof thingy isn't really a big deal if you're always careful around with your phone• The strap hooker or whatever it call, to me is something I really miss. With this I can use the phone without fear of dropping, I can even take a photo without fear of dropping the phone into a river, jungle, mountain or so whatever you can name it.OverallThe phone is a premium phone if you ask me but does it worth the price, I wouldn't say it worth it to buy this phone as of now. The music quality on this phone is superb if you use a Hi-res audio and headphone. The camera is also really good but take about 1-2 second longer than the IPhone or S6 to process the image. Heating isn't something you have to worry anymore, as per gaming it will eventually heat up after a while of playing but so does every phone. Overall I would say this is a great phone, it would be perfect for me if the camera processing is at least as fast as the S6"

And almost two month later, T-Mobile has the T-Mobile z, so I bought another one cause I need network. After that I did not change until Z3 cause I am afraid of the issue happened again. Z3 has the beautiful white, pure white. Then Z5 came, but the white one is silver. Finally I see this pink one. It looks very nice. I was worried about the network, too. But maybe because Z3 already has the set up in memory, the thing is I do not need to set up and is able to use. Really love it. I did not buy the premium because I think the size is a little bigger for me."

But it works well and fast.Phone is very responsive and it comes with Quick Charger already, the entire battery can charge in about 1hr and 15 min.I do get get LTE speeds (T-mobile) on this phone mostly on band 4 in the NYC area, however instead of showing LTE is shows 4G, but this might be a configuration issue since the phone apparently is from Honk Kong or Taiwan or somewhere else in asia."

"397965","Sony Xperia Z5 E6653 32GB 5.2-inch 4G LTE Factory Unlocked International Stock No Warranty (Pink)",5,"Finally a phone that works without any hiccups or issues. This phone simply works. I have not had any weird issues at all with this phone, and let me tell you, that is rare. Normally I'll find one nagging problem with a phone and it'll drive me crazy until I finally cave in and decide to purchase a new phone. So far, in using my Xperia Z5, I have not run into any weird situations like that. Overall I love the form factor of the phone, and the build quality is incredible. This phone simply feels well built. There is no creaking or play on the phone. This thing was engineered flawlessly and Sony has truly done a great job. Let's look at my overall take on the phone:Screen:Recently Android phones have seen a big push for larger and larger screens, but the Z5 decided to buck that trend and not offer a bigger screen or crazy resolution. Instead, Sony stuck with a smaller screen size of 5.2"" and a resolution of 1920 x 1080. Although in a battle of specs, this sounds bad, I can say the screen looks really nice. Colors are well balanced, and I have not had any issues in the sunlight with this phone.Waterproof design:The waterproofing also hasn't let me down. Sony does not recommend submerging the phone, but I can speak from experience, this will probably not damage the phone. I don't recommend doing this for two reasons though: 1- With some bad luck, water may actually damage the phone. 2- You can't really use this phone underwater.Battery life:As a moderate user, I need a phone that can last me throughout the day. This is actually one of the reasons most phones just don't make the cut for me. This phone actually manages to do a pretty respectable job of making it through the day. Screen on time caries between 5 hours and 6 hours, but that is what I'm usually getting most days. I have the phone set up to enable Stamina Mode, which saves a lot of battery once the phone hits 50%. This is different than the normal battery saving features that most phones have. Instead, Sony disables almost all background processes and only syncs when the screen is on and the phone is ""awake."" Basically, what this does is it allows the phone to enter a hibernation mode, if you will until the next time you use the phone. Calls and texts will come in, as will many things, but emails or other programs which use data will not sync until a set interval or until the screen wakes up. Overall, the phone will easily last a whole day from 6 am until about 10-11 pm.Camera:This part is hit or miss. It really depends what you're looking for and how picky you are with cameras. As a hobby photographer, I love to have a great camera. Taking a cell phone out and knowing it'll take great photos is a must for me, and Sony really sold this phone as having one of the best cameras out there. Sadly, this is rather misleading. Does the phone take good pics? Yes. Is it one of the best cameras? No. This camera struggles in the dark. If you turn off flash and take a picture in a poorly lit room, this camera kicks up the ISO and you get a blurry, noisy mess. In daylight, the camera works flawlessly. The nice thing about the camera is that it is a wide-angle lens, so you'll get much more of the image in the frame than you will with most other phones. If you are looking for a true manual mode, this just doesn't cut it. Sony has mind-boggingly integrated a terrible UI and limited what you can do to 8 Mp. I just don't understand what they are trying to do. Set the camera to superior auto, and it jumps back up to 23 Mp and takes great pics. The thing Sony just doesn't get it I don't need them to hold my hand. Let me set the camera to manual and get creative.Call quality and speakers:Call quality is good and people have not had issues hearing me. Actually, the only time this was a problem was after I had washed the phone. Water blocks the mic and people won't hear, but then again, this makes sense and shouldn't be an issue because when was the last time you made a call underwater or being dumped water on? Speakers are not the loudest, but they work well enough. If you're looking for an extremely loud phone, this isn't it. Sometimes I have a hard time hearing Waze over the radio, but I tend to have the radio a bit too loud sometimes anyways.Overall:The camera would have to be the one biggest disappointment. I think the battery life is good, and the design and feel of the phone is great. The minimal skin that Sony puts on the Z5 is also welcome, and Sony will be updating this device to the latest version of Android, but they do take a bit. Sony tends to update most of their phones, but they do take a bit to make sure everything works. With these ideas in mind, I definitely like the phone. In typical Sony fashion, they throw a bunch of features that you may or may not want, but if you find a device that supports a feature this phone has (LDAC is a great example of this), then it simply works. No headaches, no weird set up. This is what I wanted in a phone, and I'm pleased having purchased the Xperia Z5."

First I don't live in USA, I live in Ecuador, I bought the phone with the help of a relative. I received the phone in perfect conditions, no problems with hardware or software. The first two weeks I enjoyed a lot the phone. But two days ago, I had a terrible issue: the phone stopped working. The screen is in black, the LED of notifications doesn't work, the phone won't turn on. I'm not a novice in this kind of things, so I tryed to turn on the device. I've tryed in three different ways: firstable I tryed to hold on the power button with the +volume button for 10 seconds and the phone is supposed to vibrate but anything happens. My second option was the little OFF button which is located near from the sim card, I read that holding on the OFF button for 10 seconds can help but again anything happens, other sources say that you have to hold on the OFF button for 120 seconds, I've tryed but again, anything.Finally I tryed with the PC Companion, but when I start the process the PC doesn't recognize the phone, and it says that I have to hold on the power button with the +volume button, but again anything happens.I didn't do anything weird with the phone, just installing the most common apps, do some calls. But the phone just stopped working. It's obvious that is not the battery, I checked it before the phone died and the battery was in 80% of charge. As you can read, I tryed a lot of things but the phone don't want to come alive again. I don't think the problem is the screen because as I said, even the LED of notifications and the vibration have gone. I'm really mad about that. I'm searching for a special center here in my town, but I want to tell you my problem. I hope that someone can help me with this. Finally I want to show you that the phone is not broken or things like that. Thank you for reading and excuse me if I did somegrammatical mistakes."

This is to replace a T-Mobile Z3 that I dropped and broke. I very much liked the Z3 but T-Mobile no longer offers them. This new Z5 is freakin awesome I totally love it. Just a lovely and elegant design, and it's plenty speedy for whatever I use it for. I just popped in my old SIM card and it worked perfectly. Hard to imagine ever not using a Sony phone again."

"397997","Sony Xperia Z5 E6653 32GB 5.2-inch 4G LTE Factory Unlocked International Stock No Warranty (Pink)",5,"I've had my Z5 for about a week now and I am more than happy with it, lots of upgrades, the fingerprint scanner is super fast, responsive, accurate and we'll positioned; the camera is outstanding, the focus is top notch and colour representation couldn't be more accurate and stunning unlike iphone's saturated photos and the front facing captures a lot of detail, great for selfies. The ui remains simplistic and elegant which is why I prefer Sony's take on Android, very fast, no lagging at all and multi-tasking couldn't be easier, I use the little calculator a lot. The over-heating have been resolved although it does heat up a bit when running a lot of apps and from heavy usage and battery life is awesome!The design is stunning, you can see and feel it's premium and the frosted glass back is much better in terms of looks and how it feels. Only thing I did notice is that the front facing speakers on my Z5 were louder, but other than that, it's a great flagship phone, highly recommended and it's WATERPROOF! No need to wait for an alternative version like Samsung and iPhone hasn't ever had that feature so, yeah. Great job Sony."

"398002","Sony Xperia Z5 E6653 32GB 5.2-inch 4G LTE Factory Unlocked International Stock No Warranty (Pink)",5,"Here is what I personally think of the Xperia Z5.I have to say this has to be the best phone I've ever used, the features are incredible and so is the hardware. I've been an iphone user for about 6 or 7 years, in all that time owning a galaxy s3 and having a horrible experience of it breaking the second week I had it, so to me it was too delicate and expensive. So just until a few months ago I had the ""all new"" iPhone 6 plus. Before that I had the I phone 5s and it was pretty solid and fast for the time. Well just after owning the I phone for about a month the camera stopped working so I had to send it out to Apple to get the camera fixed, turns out they sent me a new one. Well all was good for about two more months when one day I forgot my phone in my back pocket and sat down in my car and I shattered the screen and bent the thin aluminum housing.that was it after seven years it was over, it was time for something else.So on to the phone...Compared to the I phone this phone is way ahead of its league. Let me start of with what I've noticed in the week that I've owned the phone. When I go to you tube and choose the 1080p option it works flawlessly with zero buffering,as to the I phone I could never watch 1080p, it would never load. Another thing is the keyboard, it is spot on. It is rare if I ever press the wrong letter while I'm trying to type, where as the I phone I would ALWAYS press the wrong key, it was extremely frustrating. Another thing I like is the ability to choose from 8,16,20,23 mp depending on the type of picture your taking and they all come out extremely detailed. Plus the ability to record in 4K. So far I love it. I also like how everything is connected. If I set a reminder or appointment it will automatically sync with my account and I'll actually get an email. So far that's all I've discovered for now, this phone is packed full of features and options I haven't even had the time to take advantage of. All I can say is I'm more than happy I made the decision to switch and chose a great phone to replace it with."
"398003","Sony Xperia Z5 E6653 32GB 5.2-inch 4G LTE Factory Unlocked International Stock No Warranty (Pink)",5,"1. Beautiful design, looks absolutely premium.2. Camera: A huge upgrade from XPERIA Z3, I feel that it produces better photos than my LX-3 does.3. Removal of the lousy flip covers on Z3 makes the water-proof function more practical, I took it with me to Santa Monica beach and take pictures in the sea - no problem.What I don't like -1. Sometimes It can take almost 10 seconds to launch the camera.2. Battery life is not as good as Z3. My Z3 COMPACT has 70% power left after 5 p.m. and Z5 has only around 40% to 50% so it's burning almost twice of the battery.2. Overheating at the upper part of the phone (above the NFC logo), but it's acceptable as most of the time you won't be touching that area"

I chat with sony support and they told me this phone is a hong kong version so they can't help me. (Sorry for my bad english)The phone is beautiful the feel is really premium the back of the phone is so much better, is matte so you don't have fingerprints problems anymore and is anti scratch, the sound of the speakers are really good the speakers are in the front(i like that). the sound with the earbuds are excellent Sony has his own Equalizer (in sound settings) the sound is really good with earbuds.The screen is really good but is not the best, Sony has bad viewing angle and the screen is too glossy(still is a good screen maybe in top 5 screens). i think samsung S6 have better screen and better camera. The first few days the phone is little heat in the top corner because i used a lot installing and doing updates and playing with the phone , but later days you have no problems with the heat.The battery is a beast some days i come home with 60% and the charge is so fast, Sony call it quick charge.The volume buttons are in really bad spot, sometimes i dont know if my phone is upside down because the position of the volume are in the bottom really weird, took me a week master the volume :).Sony is really late with this phone because is not better in speed screen or camera than samsung S6 is so late to the market i think carriers is Usa don't want this phone.(review date) The sim card and memory slot are really difficult to take out at the beginning you have to check youtube to do it, then is easy, i like that you don't need a pin to change sim card so when i travel i can change sim card in the plane with no problem.So why i bought this phone ? i do a lot of exercise and i always have my phone in my pocket and usually the sweat kill my camera.(that happend with my last 2 phones) this phone is waterproof so i have no problem running or Jogging or in the gym and the sound is crazy on spotify the phone is really beautiful the camera is very good the android version is good, look almost like stock android there's some apps that you can't uninstall, you have to life with those apps :( (i hate that) I know samsung S6 is $150 cheaper but for my lifestyle is better for me Z5 i am really happy with the phone.

He gave me his z3 mini since I had issues with the new phone I had just purchased. I understand android is not for everyone but he likes it.The phone is a step up from the Z3. Runs faster and holds more internally with a slightly larger screen without the thickness of the phone. The battery light is an improvement, but as with all things, it depends on how it is used. The phone does heat up quite quickly while playing games, but that's only a minor detail. All in all, a good solid phone with a fair amount of customization options and themes."
"398022","Sony Xperia Z5 E6653 32GB 5.2-inch 4G LTE Factory Unlocked International Stock No Warranty (Pink)",3,"I'm not too impressed with the phone so far. The overall design is very similar to the Z3 except for the finger print scanner which is great. I like how the charge port is on the bottom of the phone without a cover unlike the Z3's side covered port.I took my Z3 all over the world where the battery life was excellent and the signal was great. I find traveling with the Z5 to not be up to par with the Z3. I feel like I'm constantly charging the Z5 and I have a harder time acquiring service. At home (in the US) my Z3 had full bars and good 4G LTE connection all over the state. With the Z5 I only get half bars and it drops calls (not often but compared to the Z3, which didn't drop calls, it's a little annoying). With the Z3 the charge would last a full day to a day and a half. Now I have to charge twice a day with the Z5. Not all the time depending on usage, but it's obvious the charge doesn't last as long as the Z3's.Also, the Z5 seems to overheat. More so than the Z3 did. Just turning it on seems to heat the phone. I don't have my Z3 anymore so I can't compare the two.I feel like I wasted my money buying a finger print scanner. Maybe I have a defective phone? Maybe service sucks in the US because it's an Asia model? Overall, I'm not impressed."

I was nervous, having only used an iPhone up to this point, but the Xperia app and the cord made to bridge the phones to jump info to the new Xperia made this phone a very worthy replacement for my old iPhone. I couldn't be more pleased. I haven't run down the battery yet, it handles everything I need it to do, and is a very attractive phone. The sound quality is something I was worried about -- worry not! The sound quality is every bit as good as my iPhone was, if not better. The android platform really isn't that hard to get used to on this phone either. I'm already spoiled rotten, no turning back."

This phone heats UP big time! Especially after using for couple of minutes (just browsing and some Apping)!!! If you run Antutu, man, you probably can fry an egg on the nice etched back glass.However, you can't really blame on Sony, it's Qualcomm SD810's fault. But again, why do you want to use SD 810, Sony??? Just use the SD808! For God's sake, use SD801, who cares about 32 or 64-bit. So, it's kind of Sony's fault.Minus b**ching about SD810, the phone itself is great!Pros:- Great screen, beautiful color, and VERY bright.- Simple and nice UX- Camera focusing is fast, but images can be noisy indoor/low light- Very premium feel, wonderful design. Thumbs up for the back etched glass... No more fingerprints all over the phone!Cons:- Heat problem. Although Sony probably set a higher temperature threshold for apps to shut down by SW, you can still feel it.- Battery life isn't that great. I have a z3, and it seems to last longer and COOLER.- Volume bottom's location is a bit awkward.- Sony, can you just hire some image processing engineers from Apple? You have great image sensors. But, man, the color of photos looks really weird sometimes. Even Samsung's photo looks better than yours on their phones... And they are using stupid AMOLED.From a super Sony fan."

But it works well and fast.Phone is very responsive and it comes with Quick Charger already, the entire battery can charge in about 1hr and 15 min.I do get get LTE speeds (T-mobile) on this phone mostly on band 4 in the NYC area, however instead of showing LTE is shows 4G, but this might be a configuration issue since the phone apparently is from Honk Kong or Taiwan or somewhere else in asia."

"398109","Sony Xperia Z5 E6653 3GB/32GB 23MP 5.2-inch 4G LTE Factory Unlocked (GOLD) - International Stock No Warranty",3,"Forget about all the reviews out there saying this phone doesn't heat up. This phone heats UP big time! Especially after using for couple of minutes (just browsing and some Apping)!!! If you run Antutu, man, you probably can fry an egg on the nice etched back glass.However, you can't really blame on Sony, it's Qualcomm SD810's fault. But again, why do you want to use SD 810, Sony??? Just use the SD808! For God's sake, use SD801, who cares about 32 or 64-bit. So, it's kind of Sony's fault.Minus b**ching about SD810, the phone itself is great!Pros:- Great screen, beautiful color, and VERY bright.- Simple and nice UX- Camera focusing is fast, but images can be noisy indoor/low light- Very premium feel, wonderful design. Thumbs up for the back etched glass... No more fingerprints all over the phone!Cons:- Heat problem. Although Sony probably set a higher temperature threshold for apps to shut down by SW, you can still feel it.- Battery life isn't that great. I have a z3, and it seems to last longer and COOLER.- Volume bottom's location is a bit awkward.- Sony, can you just hire some image processing engineers from Apple? You have great image sensors. But, man, the color of photos looks really weird sometimes. Even Samsung's photo looks better than yours on their phones... And they are using stupid AMOLED.From a super Sony fan."

"398131","Sony Xperia Z5 E6653 3GB/32GB 23MP 5.2-inch 4G LTE Factory Unlocked (GOLD) - International Stock No Warranty",5,"Alright so after about a full month of using, I think I'm ready for a review now. First of all let me note that I use a E6683(Dual SIm) and its from Hong Kong. The first thing I will say is YES the LTE does work in the US, be it T-mobile or AT&T actually any GSM carrier will do.Screen• The screen is really sharp even though it's just a 1080p, thanks to it X-reality. However if you were to compare this to a Galaxy S6 or any smartphone with a AMOLED display, I would say the AMOLED does produce more vibrant color. Pixel vise I highly doubt anyone can tell the different unless you hold the very very close to your eyes (which of course, not a lot of people will do that). I do think that reading on the Z5 is more comfortable thoughSound• Sony has a lot of commercial regarding about their ""Hi-res"" music and ""Hi-res"" player and I think they are right. The stereo front speaker is nice since you will rarely block it but don't get your hope on it since its not really that loud. I mean you wouldn't want to use it as an entertain system with a lot of people anyway. Next the headphone, I've seen a lot of review saying the sound quality isn't as good as the other smartphone out there, in this case I will have to take a different ground. I own a Sony MDR-1ADAC and the sound is amazing when pair with the Z5. I tried compare with it Galaxy S6 and to me I feel like there is clearly different quality in music. On the down side, you are require to have a Hi-res music quality otherwise the quality isn't that . . . .Performance• ""SoC 810 does it overheat ?"" my answer is ""It really depend"" If you're recording a 4K video then yes it will definitely heat up but so does the other smartphone. Gaming vice I think the Z5 is doing fantastic, the Z5 can run any game so far that I tried smoothly. It does though lag sometime when it heats up (rarely, like 1% ) and has low battery mode is activate. It definitely run smoother than my HTC oneM9+ haha.• Now everyday uses such as email, texting, web surfing, all of these are buttery smooth. In fact I would say any flagship is the same in this area, unless you came from an IOS which is a lot heck smoother.Camera• That hybrid focus ! Yes it focus really fast BUT it take like a WHILE to processing the image. If you came from a Galaxy S6 or even from an Iphone 5 you will notice a substantial different in time. Iphone took a picture in like a blink of an eye, while S6 is a little slower than that but still in a blink of an eye. But for the Z5 its like 1-2 second on camera processing after picture was taken which can be huge deal if you really need to get that picture. I would say the Z5 is more like a digital camera since it be ""hit"" then done. The image quality though I would say the Z5 is better compare to the S6 or Iphone 6 but its not really a by a big margin though. Also if you really want to take a professional picture, then any smartphone wouldn't do as of now. Overall I wouldn't sacrifice the 1-2 second for a little better camera, but if you can live with that, then I would just say go ahead.• Front camera is okay but wouldn't say it's the best out there in the market compare to like a selfie centred phone. It does produce a satisfy result though.Software• If you like Stock-Android then you will probably like this too. It ran almost identical to stock android except with the small app. There's a bloatware but you can un-install it or just disable it. The finger print scanner on this phone is superb, its super and way more accurate than the Iphone 6 or even the S6 (at least to me).• This is for people who has a PS4 and want it to use for a remote play. It work technically but don't expect the same experience from the TV also a good internet connection is require to a smooth remote play too. Unless you want to connect you Z5 to a Lan cable, which work haha (I did that :D)• The battery on this phone is last longing, you can expect a whole day or more with this phone. The charging is quite slow to me though even with the Qualcomm quick charge 2.0 but maybe I was just used to a tiny battery of an Iphone 6 and S6.Phone• The phone also come with expandable storage which could give you an 32GB boost in less than $50• The water proof and dust proof thingy isn't really a big deal if you're always careful around with your phone• The strap hooker or whatever it call, to me is something I really miss. With this I can use the phone without fear of dropping, I can even take a photo without fear of dropping the phone into a river, jungle, mountain or so whatever you can name it.OverallThe phone is a premium phone if you ask me but does it worth the price, I wouldn't say it worth it to buy this phone as of now. The music quality on this phone is superb if you use a Hi-res audio and headphone. The camera is also really good but take about 1-2 second longer than the IPhone or S6 to process the image. Heating isn't something you have to worry anymore, as per gaming it will eventually heat up after a while of playing but so does every phone. Overall I would say this is a great phone, it would be perfect for me if the camera processing is at least as fast as the S6"

The only reason I had to return the phone (and I still miss it although I only had it for a week) was that it does not connect to T-mobile's 4G LTE bands. I spoke with T-mobile and looked through various APN and Network mode settings, there was just no option for ""LTE"" connection despite the fact that it seems to have the hardware for the T-mobile's LTE bands. If any one is able to connect the Z5 to the T-Moble LTE band, let me know, I will gladly buy the phone again!"

The ui remains simplistic and elegant which is why I prefer Sony's take on Android, very fast, no lagging at all and multi-tasking couldn't be easier, I use the little calculator a lot. The over-heating have been resolved although it does heat up a bit when running a lot of apps and from heavy usage and battery life is awesome!The design is stunning, you can see and feel it's premium and the frosted glass back is much better in terms of looks and how it feels. Only thing I did notice is that the front facing speakers on my Z5 were louder, but other than that, it's a great flagship phone, highly recommended and it's WATERPROOF! No need to wait for an alternative version like Samsung and iPhone hasn't ever had that feature so, yeah. Great job Sony."

"398154","Sony Xperia Z5 E6653 3GB/32GB 23MP 5.2-inch 4G LTE Factory Unlocked (GOLD) - International Stock No Warranty",5,"Here is what I personally think of the Xperia Z5.I have to say this has to be the best phone I've ever used, the features are incredible and so is the hardware. I've been an iphone user for about 6 or 7 years, in all that time owning a galaxy s3 and having a horrible experience of it breaking the second week I had it, so to me it was too delicate and expensive. So just until a few months ago I had the ""all new"" iPhone 6 plus. Before that I had the I phone 5s and it was pretty solid and fast for the time. Well just after owning the I phone for about a month the camera stopped working so I had to send it out to Apple to get the camera fixed, turns out they sent me a new one. Well all was good for about two more months when one day I forgot my phone in my back pocket and sat down in my car and I shattered the screen and bent the thin aluminum housing.that was it after seven years it was over, it was time for something else.So on to the phone...Compared to the I phone this phone is way ahead of its league. Let me start of with what I've noticed in the week that I've owned the phone. When I go to you tube and choose the 1080p option it works flawlessly with zero buffering,as to the I phone I could never watch 1080p, it would never load. Another thing is the keyboard, it is spot on. It is rare if I ever press the wrong letter while I'm trying to type, where as the I phone I would ALWAYS press the wrong key, it was extremely frustrating. Another thing I like is the ability to choose from 8,16,20,23 mp depending on the type of picture your taking and they all come out extremely detailed. Plus the ability to record in 4K. So far I love it. I also like how everything is connected. If I set a reminder or appointment it will automatically sync with my account and I'll actually get an email. So far that's all I've discovered for now, this phone is packed full of features and options I haven't even had the time to take advantage of. All I can say is I'm more than happy I made the decision to switch and chose a great phone to replace it with."
"398155","Sony Xperia Z5 E6653 3GB/32GB 23MP 5.2-inch 4G LTE Factory Unlocked (GOLD) - International Stock No Warranty",5,"1. Beautiful design, looks absolutely premium.2. Camera: A huge upgrade from XPERIA Z3, I feel that it produces better photos than my LX-3 does.3. Removal of the lousy flip covers on Z3 makes the water-proof function more practical, I took it with me to Santa Monica beach and take pictures in the sea - no problem.What I don't like -1. Sometimes It can take almost 10 seconds to launch the camera.2. Battery life is not as good as Z3. My Z3 COMPACT has 70% power left after 5 p.m. and Z5 has only around 40% to 50% so it's burning almost twice of the battery.2. Overheating at the upper part of the phone (above the NFC logo), but it's acceptable as most of the time you won't be touching that area"

First I don't live in USA, I live in Ecuador, I bought the phone with the help of a relative. I received the phone in perfect conditions, no problems with hardware or software. The first two weeks I enjoyed a lot the phone. But two days ago, I had a terrible issue: the phone stopped working. The screen is in black, the LED of notifications doesn't work, the phone won't turn on. I'm not a novice in this kind of things, so I tryed to turn on the device. I've tryed in three different ways: firstable I tryed to hold on the power button with the +volume button for 10 seconds and the phone is supposed to vibrate but anything happens. My second option was the little OFF button which is located near from the sim card, I read that holding on the OFF button for 10 seconds can help but again anything happens, other sources say that you have to hold on the OFF button for 120 seconds, I've tryed but again, anything.Finally I tryed with the PC Companion, but when I start the process the PC doesn't recognize the phone, and it says that I have to hold on the power button with the +volume button, but again anything happens.I didn't do anything weird with the phone, just installing the most common apps, do some calls. But the phone just stopped working. It's obvious that is not the battery, I checked it before the phone died and the battery was in 80% of charge. As you can read, I tryed a lot of things but the phone don't want to come alive again. I don't think the problem is the screen because as I said, even the LED of notifications and the vibration have gone. I'm really mad about that. I'm searching for a special center here in my town, but I want to tell you my problem. I hope that someone can help me with this. Finally I want to show you that the phone is not broken or things like that. Thank you for reading and excuse me if I did somegrammatical mistakes."

"398167","Sony Xperia Z5 E6653 3GB/32GB 23MP 5.2-inch 4G LTE Factory Unlocked (GOLD) - International Stock No Warranty",5,"Finally a phone that works without any hiccups or issues. This phone simply works. I have not had any weird issues at all with this phone, and let me tell you, that is rare. Normally I'll find one nagging problem with a phone and it'll drive me crazy until I finally cave in and decide to purchase a new phone. So far, in using my Xperia Z5, I have not run into any weird situations like that. Overall I love the form factor of the phone, and the build quality is incredible. This phone simply feels well built. There is no creaking or play on the phone. This thing was engineered flawlessly and Sony has truly done a great job. Let's look at my overall take on the phone:Screen:Recently Android phones have seen a big push for larger and larger screens, but the Z5 decided to buck that trend and not offer a bigger screen or crazy resolution. Instead, Sony stuck with a smaller screen size of 5.2"" and a resolution of 1920 x 1080. Although in a battle of specs, this sounds bad, I can say the screen looks really nice. Colors are well balanced, and I have not had any issues in the sunlight with this phone.Waterproof design:The waterproofing also hasn't let me down. Sony does not recommend submerging the phone, but I can speak from experience, this will probably not damage the phone. I don't recommend doing this for two reasons though: 1- With some bad luck, water may actually damage the phone. 2- You can't really use this phone underwater.Battery life:As a moderate user, I need a phone that can last me throughout the day. This is actually one of the reasons most phones just don't make the cut for me. This phone actually manages to do a pretty respectable job of making it through the day. Screen on time caries between 5 hours and 6 hours, but that is what I'm usually getting most days. I have the phone set up to enable Stamina Mode, which saves a lot of battery once the phone hits 50%. This is different than the normal battery saving features that most phones have. Instead, Sony disables almost all background processes and only syncs when the screen is on and the phone is ""awake."" Basically, what this does is it allows the phone to enter a hibernation mode, if you will until the next time you use the phone. Calls and texts will come in, as will many things, but emails or other programs which use data will not sync until a set interval or until the screen wakes up. Overall, the phone will easily last a whole day from 6 am until about 10-11 pm.Camera:This part is hit or miss. It really depends what you're looking for and how picky you are with cameras. As a hobby photographer, I love to have a great camera. Taking a cell phone out and knowing it'll take great photos is a must for me, and Sony really sold this phone as having one of the best cameras out there. Sadly, this is rather misleading. Does the phone take good pics? Yes. Is it one of the best cameras? No. This camera struggles in the dark. If you turn off flash and take a picture in a poorly lit room, this camera kicks up the ISO and you get a blurry, noisy mess. In daylight, the camera works flawlessly. The nice thing about the camera is that it is a wide-angle lens, so you'll get much more of the image in the frame than you will with most other phones. If you are looking for a true manual mode, this just doesn't cut it. Sony has mind-boggingly integrated a terrible UI and limited what you can do to 8 Mp. I just don't understand what they are trying to do. Set the camera to superior auto, and it jumps back up to 23 Mp and takes great pics. The thing Sony just doesn't get it I don't need them to hold my hand. Let me set the camera to manual and get creative.Call quality and speakers:Call quality is good and people have not had issues hearing me. Actually, the only time this was a problem was after I had washed the phone. Water blocks the mic and people won't hear, but then again, this makes sense and shouldn't be an issue because when was the last time you made a call underwater or being dumped water on? Speakers are not the loudest, but they work well enough. If you're looking for an extremely loud phone, this isn't it. Sometimes I have a hard time hearing Waze over the radio, but I tend to have the radio a bit too loud sometimes anyways.Overall:The camera would have to be the one biggest disappointment. I think the battery life is good, and the design and feel of the phone is great. The minimal skin that Sony puts on the Z5 is also welcome, and Sony will be updating this device to the latest version of Android, but they do take a bit. Sony tends to update most of their phones, but they do take a bit to make sure everything works. With these ideas in mind, I definitely like the phone. In typical Sony fashion, they throw a bunch of features that you may or may not want, but if you find a device that supports a feature this phone has (LDAC is a great example of this), then it simply works. No headaches, no weird set up. This is what I wanted in a phone, and I'm pleased having purchased the Xperia Z5."

I chat with sony support and they told me this phone is a hong kong version so they can't help me. (Sorry for my bad english)The phone is beautiful the feel is really premium the back of the phone is so much better, is matte so you don't have fingerprints problems anymore and is anti scratch, the sound of the speakers are really good the speakers are in the front(i like that). the sound with the earbuds are excellent Sony has his own Equalizer (in sound settings) the sound is really good with earbuds.The screen is really good but is not the best, Sony has bad viewing angle and the screen is too glossy(still is a good screen maybe in top 5 screens). i think samsung S6 have better screen and better camera. The first few days the phone is little heat in the top corner because i used a lot installing and doing updates and playing with the phone , but later days you have no problems with the heat.The battery is a beast some days i come home with 60% and the charge is so fast, Sony call it quick charge.The volume buttons are in really bad spot, sometimes i dont know if my phone is upside down because the position of the volume are in the bottom really weird, took me a week master the volume :).Sony is really late with this phone because is not better in speed screen or camera than samsung S6 is so late to the market i think carriers is Usa don't want this phone.(review date) The sim card and memory slot are really difficult to take out at the beginning you have to check youtube to do it, then is easy, i like that you don't need a pin to change sim card so when i travel i can change sim card in the plane with no problem.So why i bought this phone ? i do a lot of exercise and i always have my phone in my pocket and usually the sweat kill my camera.(that happend with my last 2 phones) this phone is waterproof so i have no problem running or Jogging or in the gym and the sound is crazy on spotify the phone is really beautiful the camera is very good the android version is good, look almost like stock android there's some apps that you can't uninstall, you have to life with those apps :( (i hate that) I know samsung S6 is $150 cheaper but for my lifestyle is better for me Z5 i am really happy with the phone.

He gave me his z3 mini since I had issues with the new phone I had just purchased. I understand android is not for everyone but he likes it.The phone is a step up from the Z3. Runs faster and holds more internally with a slightly larger screen without the thickness of the phone. The battery light is an improvement, but as with all things, it depends on how it is used. The phone does heat up quite quickly while playing games, but that's only a minor detail. All in all, a good solid phone with a fair amount of customization options and themes."
"398214","Sony Xperia Z5 E6653 3GB/32GB 23MP 5.2-inch 4G LTE Factory Unlocked (GOLD) - International Stock No Warranty",3,"I'm not too impressed with the phone so far. The overall design is very similar to the Z3 except for the finger print scanner which is great. I like how the charge port is on the bottom of the phone without a cover unlike the Z3's side covered port.I took my Z3 all over the world where the battery life was excellent and the signal was great. I find traveling with the Z5 to not be up to par with the Z3. I feel like I'm constantly charging the Z5 and I have a harder time acquiring service. At home (in the US) my Z3 had full bars and good 4G LTE connection all over the state. With the Z5 I only get half bars and it drops calls (not often but compared to the Z3, which didn't drop calls, it's a little annoying). With the Z3 the charge would last a full day to a day and a half. Now I have to charge twice a day with the Z5. Not all the time depending on usage, but it's obvious the charge doesn't last as long as the Z3's.Also, the Z5 seems to overheat. More so than the Z3 did. Just turning it on seems to heat the phone. I don't have my Z3 anymore so I can't compare the two.I feel like I wasted my money buying a finger print scanner. Maybe I have a defective phone? Maybe service sucks in the US because it's an Asia model? Overall, I'm not impressed."

I was nervous, having only used an iPhone up to this point, but the Xperia app and the cord made to bridge the phones to jump info to the new Xperia made this phone a very worthy replacement for my old iPhone. I couldn't be more pleased. I haven't run down the battery yet, it handles everything I need it to do, and is a very attractive phone. The sound quality is something I was worried about -- worry not! The sound quality is every bit as good as my iPhone was, if not better. The android platform really isn't that hard to get used to on this phone either. I'm already spoiled rotten, no turning back."

And almost two month later, T-Mobile has the T-Mobile z, so I bought another one cause I need network. After that I did not change until Z3 cause I am afraid of the issue happened again. Z3 has the beautiful white, pure white. Then Z5 came, but the white one is silver. Finally I see this pink one. It looks very nice. I was worried about the network, too. But maybe because Z3 already has the set up in memory, the thing is I do not need to set up and is able to use. Really love it. I did not buy the premium because I think the size is a little bigger for me."

This phone heats UP big time! Especially after using for couple of minutes (just browsing and some Apping)!!! If you run Antutu, man, you probably can fry an egg on the nice etched back glass.However, you can't really blame on Sony, it's Qualcomm SD810's fault. But again, why do you want to use SD 810, Sony??? Just use the SD808! For God's sake, use SD801, who cares about 32 or 64-bit. So, it's kind of Sony's fault.Minus b**ching about SD810, the phone itself is great!Pros:- Great screen, beautiful color, and VERY bright.- Simple and nice UX- Camera focusing is fast, but images can be noisy indoor/low light- Very premium feel, wonderful design. Thumbs up for the back etched glass... No more fingerprints all over the phone!Cons:- Heat problem. Although Sony probably set a higher temperature threshold for apps to shut down by SW, you can still feel it.- Battery life isn't that great. I have a z3, and it seems to last longer and COOLER.- Volume bottom's location is a bit awkward.- Sony, can you just hire some image processing engineers from Apple? You have great image sensors. But, man, the color of photos looks really weird sometimes. Even Samsung's photo looks better than yours on their phones... And they are using stupid AMOLED.From a super Sony fan."

First of all let me note that I use a E6683(Dual SIm) and its from Hong Kong. The first thing I will say is YES the LTE does work in the US, be it T-mobile or AT&T actually any GSM carrier will do.Screen• The screen is really sharp even though it's just a 1080p, thanks to it X-reality. However if you were to compare this to a Galaxy S6 or any smartphone with a AMOLED display, I would say the AMOLED does produce more vibrant color. Pixel vise I highly doubt anyone can tell the different unless you hold the very very close to your eyes (which of course, not a lot of people will do that). I do think that reading on the Z5 is more comfortable thoughSound• Sony has a lot of commercial regarding about their ""Hi-res"" music and ""Hi-res"" player and I think they are right. The stereo front speaker is nice since you will rarely block it but don't get your hope on it since its not really that loud. I mean you wouldn't want to use it as an entertain system with a lot of people anyway. Next the headphone, I've seen a lot of review saying the sound quality isn't as good as the other smartphone out there, in this case I will have to take a different ground. I own a Sony MDR-1ADAC and the sound is amazing when pair with the Z5. I tried compare with it Galaxy S6 and to me I feel like there is clearly different quality in music. On the down side, you are require to have a Hi-res music quality otherwise the quality isn't that . . . .Performance• ""SoC 810 does it overheat ?"" my answer is ""It really depend"" If you're recording a 4K video then yes it will definitely heat up but so does the other smartphone. Gaming vice I think the Z5 is doing fantastic, the Z5 can run any game so far that I tried smoothly. It does though lag sometime when it heats up (rarely, like 1% ) and has low battery mode is activate. It definitely run smoother than my HTC oneM9+ haha.• Now everyday uses such as email, texting, web surfing, all of these are buttery smooth. In fact I would say any flagship is the same in this area, unless you came from an IOS which is a lot heck smoother.Camera• That hybrid focus ! Yes it focus really fast BUT it take like a WHILE to processing the image. If you came from a Galaxy S6 or even from an Iphone 5 you will notice a substantial different in time. Iphone took a picture in like a blink of an eye, while S6 is a little slower than that but still in a blink of an eye. But for the Z5 its like 1-2 second on camera processing after picture was taken which can be huge deal if you really need to get that picture. I would say the Z5 is more like a digital camera since it be ""hit"" then done. The image quality though I would say the Z5 is better compare to the S6 or Iphone 6 but its not really a by a big margin though. Also if you really want to take a professional picture, then any smartphone wouldn't do as of now. Overall I wouldn't sacrifice the 1-2 second for a little better camera, but if you can live with that, then I would just say go ahead.• Front camera is okay but wouldn't say it's the best out there in the market compare to like a selfie centred phone. It does produce a satisfy result though.Software• If you like Stock-Android then you will probably like this too. It ran almost identical to stock android except with the small app. There's a bloatware but you can un-install it or just disable it. The finger print scanner on this phone is superb, its super and way more accurate than the Iphone 6 or even the S6 (at least to me).• This is for people who has a PS4 and want it to use for a remote play. It work technically but don't expect the same experience from the TV also a good internet connection is require to a smooth remote play too. Unless you want to connect you Z5 to a Lan cable, which work haha (I did that :D)• The battery on this phone is last longing, you can expect a whole day or more with this phone. The charging is quite slow to me though even with the Qualcomm quick charge 2.0 but maybe I was just used to a tiny battery of an Iphone 6 and S6.Phone• The phone also come with expandable storage which could give you an 32GB boost in less than $50• The water proof and dust proof thingy isn't really a big deal if you're always careful around with your phone• The strap hooker or whatever it call, to me is something I really miss. With this I can use the phone without fear of dropping, I can even take a photo without fear of dropping the phone into a river, jungle, mountain or so whatever you can name it.OverallThe phone is a premium phone if you ask me but does it worth the price, I wouldn't say it worth it to buy this phone as of now. The music quality on this phone is superb if you use a Hi-res audio and headphone. The camera is also really good but take about 1-2 second longer than the IPhone or S6 to process the image. Heating isn't something you have to worry anymore, as per gaming it will eventually heat up after a while of playing but so does every phone. Overall I would say this is a great phone, it would be perfect for me if the camera processing is at least as fast as the S6"

The only reason I had to return the phone (and I still miss it although I only had it for a week) was that it does not connect to T-mobile's 4G LTE bands. I spoke with T-mobile and looked through various APN and Network mode settings, there was just no option for ""LTE"" connection despite the fact that it seems to have the hardware for the T-mobile's LTE bands.

Unfortunately, I am NOT satisfied at aaaalll and I tried SOO HARRD to love this phone. Sigh...When I first got this phone, it was overheating right out the box and the battery was running down so fast. It went from 50% to about 36% in less than an hour. Another great disappointment was that the phone kept overheating from me just going through the phone. There were no games and nothing was downloaded as yet. It was just me checking out the new phone. Yet I felt like I was playing a racing game from the amount of heat it gave off.Later, I tried updating it and each time the updates wouldn't finish. The phone would get so hot, I could not hold it! I had to pick it up from the bottom in a corner and that is not safe! I could not touch the upper 3/4 of the phone.So finally after about 2 days the phone finally accepted the system update. The overheating from menial tasks subsided but the battery life was still poor so I had stamina mode activated permanently to help it. I even downloaded a battery doctor to help support the horrid battery. I really wanted this phone to work out.Let me jump on the camera for a bit.. The camera quality is excellent. However, to my great disappointment, when I took a picture with the flash on in the night, it was HORRIBLEEEE. I tried flash in the day just to see how it would turn out.It was also a great disappointment.What happens is when the picture is taken with flash, the bottom half of it is faded into green or white. Then the entire picture appears translucent and blurry. This happens EVERY time I use the flash.Now, this problem is the worst of all... Everytime I get a call and I answer the call, the phone goes blank and unresponsive. I cannot hang up. I cannot put the phone on loudspeak. I cannot see how many minutes I have been talking for. NOTHING!!! I have to wait until the other person hangs up!!! Sometimes even after they hang up, I STILL can't use the phone until a few minutes after. This is madness.Oh and its the same problem if I dare to use the phone to call anyone. But what actually makes calling worse is, if the person I am calling does not answer, it goes rings out and goes to the answering machine over and over again because the screen stays blank and I cannot stop it. Then when I press the power button nothing happens. The answering machine and the ringing just keeps going while the screen stays blank.So, still determined, I called Sony Xperia support and I was told to repair the phone with the Xperia Companion. I did that. It took about 4 hours. So happily, I rebooted the phone and then... The same problem with the calls persisted -___-....That was the last straw, I didn't have the phone for even a month yet the amount of defects and problems I've had over this 2 weeks was unbelievable. I inquired earlier and was told this phone is new. I cannot believe that with the amount of problems I have experienced. I REALLYYY wanted to like this phone. I really did but good gosh, I've tried everything and stressed myself out in the process. I cannot do this anymore."

The phone came to North America in a reasonable amount of time, and it's packed with useful features. I can't really name them all, but some of my favorites include the 200GB expandable microSD slot, waterproof design without the annoying rubber plugs, superb audio volume and screen quality, optional 4K video recording mode, digital stabilization, up to 5 fingerprints can be saved for quick access, lanyard port for extreme sports enthusiasts, decent battery life (depending on power conservation mode), incredibly fast processor, etc. I was also pleasantly surprised to find that the phone doesn't overheat at all under normal use – which was one of my other points of hesitance. It might get a bit warm after recording in 4K or playing a graphically demanding game for a while, but that's the same even for DSLR's.One crucial thing to keep in mind, however, is this phone is most readily compatible with AT&T and T-Mobile networks in the United States. If you go to Japan, I believe it's Docomo and Softbank (AU has its own version of the Z5), and if you're in New Zealand then 2Degrees is the way to go."

"398533","Sony Xperia Z5 Premium Dual E6883 5.5"" 23MP 32GB Smartphone - International Version / No Warranty (Black)",5,"Okay, just so you know, I am what you might call an ""early adopter"" In other words I am a sucker for smartphones. Every time somone came out with something new I just had to have one for my own. Ever since I brought home my brand new first generation iPhone, I have always been enthralled with these little magical rectangles made of metal and glass. I have had every iteration of iPhone, right on up through the 6S. I have had three HTC's including the amazing M7 and M8. I have owned a OnePlus one, an LG V10 a Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge, and I still use my S7 Edge as a back up phone. But, I can honestly and unequivocally say that not a single one of them hold a candle to the Xperia Z5 Premium. The 4K display is amazing of course, and the camera is incredible, but what makes this phone stand out is that every little feature that it has works flawlessly. I liked my Galaxy phones but both of them would heat up, lock up, refuse to connect to my car via bluetooth, refuse to charge ...the list goes on. On the other hand, the iPhones worked perfectly, but the un-customizable UI just became so damned tedious after a while. Enter the Z5 Premium. It has none of the cartoonish color saturation and UI of the Galaxy models that the tekkies fawn over. The Z5 Premium just has a 4K display that is smoother, cleaner perfectly colored and blows your mind when you watch 4K media. Anybody who has ever seen a Sony Bravia HDTV as compared to a Samsung will know what I mean. The Sony makes the images look like they are recorded on smoothsilky 16mm film, while the Samsung's images ""pop out"" but look like they are recorded on soap opera videotape. Moreover, every single little feature that glitches or lags, or freezes the Samsung, the Z5 Premium handles without even breaking a sweat. The Z5 Premium's hardware feels ""premium"" in the hand and it's solid, minimalistic, thin bezeled design is pure art. Oh, and did I mention that it's water resistant? Yeah, customizable too. I read somewhere that the Samsung Galaxy S7 is the ""Lamborghini"" of smart phones. Let the kids have their ""Lamborghini"", I will happily keep my ""Aston Martin"" Xperia Z5 Premium.Sony Xperia Z5 Premium Dual E6883 5.5"" 23MP 32GB Smartphone - International Version / No Warranty (Black)"
"398534","Sony Xperia Z5 Premium Dual E6883 5.5"" 23MP 32GB Smartphone - International Version / No Warranty (Black)",5,"The product has exceeded my expectations. I've seen so many bad reviews about Sony's devices and this one in particular as well that I was afraid of purchasing this expensive device. I'm just loving that it has a lot of features other Android devices are far from having. I used to have a Samsung Galaxy SIII rooted with a lot of extra features that did not come with Samsung's Android.The only thing I really miss from my older device is the root feature I used to use a lot. I just don't root this one because of warranty issues and DRM keys issues. But don't think that most users will ever need that. Sony has made this with already awesome features."

Camera is pretty good... I like the way Sonys take photographs.Sound too is a plus. Many reviews speak about speaker quality. I for one rarely use the external speakers... I use Bluetooth all the time. I'm coming from a Samsung Galaxy s6 edge and found the edge attenuated Bluetooth too much. Sonys Bluetooth streaming is strong and rich.

The ONLY good thing about this product is the camera. The display and brightness is despicable. Even on the brightest setting it seems like it is only 50%. I get 75% battery usage in a day barely using it. I take it off the plug at 9am and it projects that it will die by 4pm. My phone is fully optimized on top of that. When I check my battery info it says my screen uses 40%-50% . How is that possible when I am working all day barely on my phone. I really wish I never got this phone. Its very glitchy, and absolute mess. I have less than 10 download apps. Nothing different than my last phone. This is crazy, the way this performs I would expect from a $200 smartphone. Sony really oversold the experience and expectations with this one."

Not cool.No manual, only in Chinese. Well there is Sonys webpage. If you pay 640 bucks for a phone you could expect more, at least some multilingual manual.The phone comes with a Chinese power plug and a US adapter. Charging worked ok. Just remember to plug the adapter in the right way....The phone itself is setup in Chinese. Yes you read right. Took me a while to figure out how to switch it to legible characters, ie English.When trying to order a nano sim card from ATT, they ask to call their customer service, for some reason unknown to me.

Google ""Sony z5 Premium camera tests""Laggy - Google ""Sony z5 Premium Lag issues""Apps freeze and crash often - Google ""Sony z5 Premium freezes""The thing I can't get over is the Bluetooth. Its at a low priority on the processes list I guess, so If you're connected to Bluetooth car, headset, speaker and do anything else, the music freezes and is choppy while you're using your other application. At first anyways.... Eventually music was like listening to a scratched CD. Skipping and freezing. Then today it just stopped. I can connect to devices with my Bluetooth, bu no audio is produced. This problem is super common with hopes of being fixed with the 6.0 update... but no luck. Of course Sony customer support offers 0 help aside from, turn it off and on or if you're not connecting with Sony products it must be a comparability problem and the other manufacturer's fault. Should have gone with the S7"

I've been babying it and taking care of the phone as much as possible, and in that time I've fallen in love. My personal experience is the UI is nice and clean, similar to stock Android with a few added extras, and it's very responsive. I know it's not 4K all the time, and until the Marshmallow update releases, there won't be much support as of yet, however the up scaling of videos in the YouTube app still look simply amazing. The camera isn't really want most hyped it up to be, but I find that it works well and edges out my Note 4 and my father's iPhone 6S Plus, which is perfect enough for me.From the general feel of the build quality, I'd have to mark Sony down as the ""Apple"" of Androids, since I haven't personally felt that the other Android devices did it for me. I tried the Note 5, S6 Edge Plus, iPhone 6S Plus, Nexus 6P, and multiple others, but the Xperia takes the cake in feeling the most premium to me. Calls sound crystal clear, and the front facing speakers, while not as powerful as some HTC or Motorola phones, still sound much better than my previous iPhone.All in all, love the device, hope Sony continues to push out updates for it in the future, and I may stick with them should they continue producing this type of quality into their devices."

Yes but its still worth the hype. Finger Print scanner on the Power key is fast and responsive every timeBattery Life is not exactly 48hrs but i keep everything on so i cant really benchmark.to achieve two days battery life, you have to enter stamina and ultra stamina mode which really turns the phone into a dumb large phone since you'll have to give up all the cool smart features for a very reduced battery consumption. the battery barely discharges if it is inactive and that gives me a comfort feel that i wont loose charge when the device is not in use"
"398573","Sony Xperia Z5 Premium E6853 5.5-Inch 4K UHD Display Factory Unlocked (BLACK) - International Stock No Warranty",3,"I have been switching from a phone to another for a while and the last phone I got was the Nexus 6P. I tried LG, Motorola, Samsung, HTC, iPhone, and Nexus 6P. I never gave Sony a chance, because I haven't seen them doing any major advertisements so I assumed it isn't a great phone. When I used the phone, I regret not buying Sony phones before. The phone is so user friendly and so clean of a software, even better than the pure Android like the ones, which comes in Nexus lineup.Basically you are buying quality !! a product that is well build and carefully crafted, and the software is perfectly modified.The only thing I don't like is the finger prints left on the back of the phone and the lack of the number of cases available to purchase.Update: Sadly I returned the phone, because I was getting Black Screen of Death during my calls. I can't do anything when I get it until the person I am talking to hang up then the screen turn back on. I tried all the fixes, but none of them worked, so I ended up returning it. I liked the phone so much, but I don't want to risk buying a phone that has a common issue since the Z2."

The fingerprint scanner works really amazing, much better than iphone 6s and galaxy S6. the screen is GORGEOUS, I can't explain it in words. the stereo speakers sounds very clear and super cool, but my old Xperia Z2 sounds a little louder than Z5 Premium. the led light is situated in the corner of the phone and is very small, for me, the led light of my old Z2 looks a lot better than this, positioned in the superior speaker and it was much larger than the Z5 one.The battery life is AMAZING and the quick charger works excelent, the phone charges completely in 1 hour approximately."

Overall I definitely like it better than the Z5. I'm sure it'll work well playing remote play with the Ps4 and ps1, gba and all the other emulators just like the Z5.

I think it is funny that other brands are just now water proofing their phones, Sony is way ahead of the curve in that aspect.

"398600","Sony Xperia Z5 Premium E6853 5.5-Inch 4K UHD Display Factory Unlocked (BLACK) - International Stock No Warranty",5,"This is my first ever Android Phone, having used BlackBerry since 2009. So most of my ""problems"" are just learning a new User Interface / Operating System (I'd have that problem regardless of what Android or Apple phone I switched to).One feature I didn't think I'd use is the fingerprint scanner. This scanner is accurate and trouble free. I love it. Compared to my wife's Note 5, it feels like a next generation technology (I don't tell her that). The USA Version of the regular Z5 has deleted this option. Big mistake, I'd get the international version of the Z5 regardless if I was getting the Premium or not. It's a very cool scanner, very impressed with the technology.I saw a few reviews saying that LTE doesn't work - it does. It doesn't display ""4GTLE"" it only displays ""4G"" but rest assured you're on LTE. I took a screenshot of a speed test using T-Mobile, USA but AT&T is also a GSM carrier and this phone has the bands for it as well.OK, I love the screen. I know that OLED is all the rage these days but I love this LCD screen because it can dim low in a dark room and can get very bright. The auto sensor works great on this phone too. The screen is beautiful.The camera is great! Coming from BlackBerry which always used subpar crappy cameras, I admit anything would have been an improvement but it takes great photos in line with my wife's Note 5 (probably better but we won't tell her).The front stereo speakers are fine. They are not as loud as one or two out there but are louder and clearer than many if not most.I love that it's water resistant.It looks beautiful. I got the Chrome but since I'm afraid to carry it naked and put a minimal transparent case on it, I'm wondering if I shouldn't have gone with the Gold. Any color choice is beautiful.As far as the 4K - The stock 4K video by Sony does look great but so does anything I'm viewing on here. I'd base my choice between Z5 or Z5 Premium based on what you prefer in phone size and screen size rather than 4K or not.I used to love BlackBerry because I liked carrying something different (they are very rare these days in the US) and I like this phone for the same reason. Everyone has either an Apple or a Samsung - but this Sony is something different. I really like it and recommend it.I intend on updating this review at the start of 2017 to give an update on how it works long term. But the initial quality is outstanding."

My last 2 phones have been iPhones and this phone is far better in every aspect. I've seen reviews of people complaining about the finger print scanner but I have not had any problems yet its extremely responsive to the touch. Also since I had read those reviews I simply used two Id fingerprint scanners for the same finger so that might have helped.

Some are great upgrades from my previous phone, the Z1.This is just personal preferences, but I liked the Walkman App before it turned to the Android Lollipop Music App.Lollipop is just not type. I will probably revert to KitKat because I love the UI and overall feel better than Lollipop's.The power button is slightly sunken. Unlike the Z1, where it was easily accessible with a slightly outward button.Lastly, and yes, this is was shocking for me as well. The screen.With a whopping 806 PPI (Pixels Per Inch) 4K screen, you would expect the display quality to be as clear as looking out a window. So unless I bought a faulty phone, I kid you not, the screen looks pixelated. Yes, you read that right. Pixelated.Now, I know that everything except the Album and Video apps are down-scaled to 1080P. So I tested the 4K photos and videos, and to my astonishment, there they are! Still looking pixelated, even at 4K. I had to look through a magnifying glass to see them up close. I compared my old Z1, my dad's Z Ultra and the Z5 Premium. Again big surprise, both my old Z1 and the Z ultra pixels can barely be seen, with very faint black lines separating the pixels, while on the Z5 Premium the lines were considerably much more noticeable.Looking at all three phones from a normal distance, the Z1 and Z Ultra's screens do not look pixelated at all, while my Z5, even from a fair distance, you can still faintly see the pixelation.Basically, I have phone with a 4K display, but it almost makes me feel like it has a WVGA display.Lastly, I've never seen a phone reflect dots from a turned off display before. My Z5 Premium for some reason reflects dots, pixels, I don't know what they are in a squared grid pattern whenever the screen reflects light. Whether its from the Sun or any regular light, you will clearly see them. Regardless if whether the phone is on or not.Conclusion.The phone itself is awesome. Great new features, great audio, superb built quality and respectable camera.It might just be my phone, its too early to tell, since a lot people don't own this phone yet, but make sure to check with others who own the phone and ask if they see pixelation or have a faulty displays in their Z5 Premium as well.[[ASIN:B0171GYNGW Sony Xperia Z5 Premium E6853 5.5-Inch 4K UHD Display Factory Unlocked (CHROME) - International Stock No Warranty]"

"398621","Sony Xperia Z5 Premium E6853 5.5-Inch 4K UHD Display Factory Unlocked (BLACK) - International Stock No Warranty",4,"So far this is the best phone I have ever owned. I'm coming from a Galaxy Note 3 due to the Note 5 not having expandable storage and disappointing me in almost every aspect.First off, after using this phone I immediately fell in love with the waterproof feature. I will never buy another phone that doesn't have resistance to water, I mean honestly the technology is there, if the big companies cant get on the train and get this feature I will simply stay away. I also was able to easily expand my storage by 128gb with a micro SD. The 4K display is something I could live without but it is a nice feature and I can't complain. Battery life is very good for this device I am able to fall asleep with 40% battery from a day of moderate use, wake up and use the phone till mid afternoon with no problems. Charging is pretty fast also. I can leave the phone and forget about it for about an hour and come back to a ton of battery life.I removed a star for the fingerprint scanner getting a slight scratch within the first month of use and rendering it un-usable. Would be nice to use it but not a whole lot I can do about it. I think the next phone I will get will have to have usb type c with super high speed data transfer. We shall see what the future holds."

"398625","Sony Xperia Z5 Premium E6853 5.5-Inch 4K UHD Display Factory Unlocked (BLACK) - International Stock No Warranty",5,"Probably the best phone in the US that no one has heard of unless you're a phone geek. I've had to work with phones for 10 years in the cellular industry and have seen many phones come and go. I have loved the recent Xperia series from Sony and always believe that they deliver the best products. In terms of phones, it's no secret that Sony has had a rocky history to say the least (Sony Ericsson partnership and a myriad of failures).I'll try and keep this short, but at least provide some more of a detailed review. Feel free to check the other versions of Z5 Premium (Chrome and Black) for others, but I notice the Gold version is sorely lacking any thorough review so here go:I've been using this phone for about month and don't typically review anything until I have had a chance to use it for more than a few days. First impressions can be misleading, so I let myself download apps, use throughout the day, take pictures, videos, etc and get a feel for the phone. I will say I have used a few other Xperias before. I am jumping from a Xperia Z1 I purchased in Japan about 2 years ago and loved that phone as well. Probably some Sony fanboy-ish going on here, but I will try and be as neutral as possible.Performance of the phone is fantastic. Everything moves very quick and smooth. Responds very well overall. One of my favorite features (yes it's nothing new, but performs so so well) is the fingerprint scanner. Like I said, I have worked in the cellular industry and I know the iPhone first brought this to the mainstream but I've really found myself using the fingerprint scanner a lot and the fact that the phone is larger, the scanner is actually a much easier way to unlock the screen than sliding up the unlock motion. And again, it just works so smooth!Perhaps my favorite part of this phone, and a big purchasing decision, is the camera. I have two little ones and whenever the family is out, I am typically default camera man, so there was a lot of debate with the wife as to whether I should invest in a good DSLR camera or buy the loaded Z5P phone. I haven't regretted my decision as the Z5P takes beautiful pictures, 23MP, though I find myself using the 20MP 16:9 format and even the Premium Auto mode is great for taking quick shots (using the quick wake up mode). Yes, it does take 4K video, which looks unbelievable. And Sony does have a little snapshot tool to take 8MP screenshots of 4K video stills if you so desire. The 4K SCREEN ON THE PHONE looks phenomenal. I've read a lot of tech sites instantly saying that the 4K screen is unnecessary and a gimmick, however to be honest, I'm not sure what screen they're looking at. I've put up the Z5P screen next to my Z1 (1080p) and for me personally I can definitely tell a difference. The Z5P is so much clearer and the colors are very vibrant (though not overly saturated). Also, the camera has a 1080p/60fps video mode which also works great. Lastly, the camera has an insanely fast autofocus, which does actually autofocus, which helps with quickshots. Again, camera alone was worth the purchase.Battery: Always a touchy issue with so many and always the quickest to get people to stop buying your product. With heavy usage, and again, from experience, I know what constitutes heavy, you can still EASILY get a days worth of usage on your phone. I have tried several times to intentionally kill my battery doing things that typically kill other phones instantly--biggies being streaming video, games, GPS, camera and the often under-appreciated phone calls/video(data) calls. I don't think people really know how much phone calls kill your battery, but again, tried to get it to under a day and it didn't really work. I would still have about 20% at the end (say 9-10pm) of the day. Now again, I don't have the luxury of literally sitting down from 8am-8pm doing nothing but that, but throughout the day, I would watch/play/listen/etc and still had enough battery to do more by the time I put the kids to bed. Also, the last few days I've been trying something else and seeing how the battery preserves itself. During work, I don't heavily use my phone (because, you know, I'm WORKING), but even at that with 2 email accounts synced up, and other various services running (mind you, no facebook, twitter or other SNS-sorry no social life :) I still do some messaging but still have about 80% at the end of day. I DO NOT charge the phone overnight, lose a couple more percentages and start day 2 with about 75-78%. I then continue to work again and continue to drain battery and again still have a moderate (about 65%) battery. Now again, by no means am I saying this is an end-all guide to the 5-day battery phone, but again, for practical usage for people who don't live on their phones 24/7 I can easily get 3 working days of usage on my phone, maybe 4 if I push it. Again many factors go into this, screen brightness, accounts, etc. but I have been thrilled with my battery life.Ok, I'm rambling too much so I'll wrap it up. Quickly wanted to address a negative:Bezel--never understood why people think this phone has larger bezels than others. I think there was someone who actually measured the % of screen that the bezels take up and Xperias actually have a better % than iPhones and some others. Now one thing I will note is the 3 touch buttons (back, home and apps) are taking up part of the 5.5"" screen. While others, like Samsung have the buttons underneath so you get a true full screen. Anyway, minor design gripe, but still more than enough real estate on the screen.Little extra here too, again, read about how some people thought it was such a novelty that the phone was water/dust proof rated yet kept the charging port open. If you have experience with Japanese phones, you probably know that waterproofing phones is very old news. Almost all Japanese phone manufacturers, Sony, Sharp, Kyocera, make all their phones waterproof because many Japanese take their phones in the bath with them. In fact, my wife has a basic Sharp Aquos from about 2-2 1/2 years ago that is also waterproof, but already had the open charging port design implemented. Again, just a little tidbit there about the novelty of waterproofing phones, so yes the charging port is open, but the phone is still sealed. I also can attest to this as I have used the phone for pictures in not only heavy rainfall but also at a waterpark (my little girl drenched my phone but totally fine).Alright, I'm done now. Hopefully this helped out and if you purchase it, ENJOY!"

Waterproof, scratch resistant, and fingerprints don't really show unless you really got greasy ones, fantastic display, great sound quality. I just found it a bit big to hold in my palm, and the volume toggle is not well placed as many have complained about....so why doesn't Sony change it? 4K pics are great and so is the camera, but don't think it's as good as a ""regular"" camera with a bigger lens. Plus, buildings and tress may ""bend"" a bit depending on your picture angle which is kinda like a cheaper point and shoot.

I was worried about getting this phone reading some reviews but I'm glad I went ahead with it. There is heating issue but only when you use the camera for a longer period but it cools down quick too.

Built strongly with metal bezel and chrome back, I invested in the Rhidon covers for the front and back and keep it in a leather holster when its on my belt.

Best display I ever seen on a phone.It's probably the coolest phone I ever picked up! I can tout the highest price I ever paid for a phone in my life by far, but it is worth it because it interests me.If you are tech savvy and like the challenge of customizing devices with their factory restrictions in mind, then first do your research on these models and then some, before jumping into it with utter confidence if it interests you.Thank you Sony.

"398651","Sony Xperia Z5 Premium E6853 5.5-Inch 4K UHD Display Factory Unlocked (BLACK) - International Stock No Warranty",5,"So far everything is working fine.Urgent info - The phone I received was configured in Chinese (Mandarin) so it needed to be reset in English which was a relatively easy task if you are familiar with the android OS.Next, in order to use any mobile data for at&t or T-mobile you must set your access point for each respective company. This is as simple as searching the APN names for either and setting it accordingly or calling technical support to get the APN designation.Notes - The phone is very slippery, I've never contemplated buying phone cases for previous phones but considering how nice this phone is I would hate to drop it. I am coming from a Sony Xperia Z(first gen) which was ergonomically superior.The camera is far superior than any other phone I've used with great clarity and fast enough to snap off some quick shots.As others have stated the sound key is not in a good position but it may be an issue of internal space. It works fine in the horizontal position which it seems more suited to. The screen is excellent with no flaws spotted yet.As with heat, I haven't noticed anything alarming. I've shot two 5 minute videos and it does get warm but nothing worse than what I've used before. It surprisingly gets hotter while on a call.Update- After a few weeks of use and the latest OS update, the heat has grown a bit but nothing concerning, The heat dissipates rather quickly when yo run you hand over it.Going back to the slipperiness. Man, its like trying to hold a ice cube sometimes. It really needs a case or rubberized bumper. I tried cleaning it with alcohol, but nothing helped.Do not update this phone to latest update. The first received OS system worked fine, there has been a few niggles with the latest software patch. Sometimes the screen will fail to rotate on apps, and will only start working again if you restart phone, or launch the camera and open a picture(only thing I've tested so far to get it to work). This has happened twice in the passed week and i don't know what is causing it, but it never happened before the update.Comparison against the new Samsung s7 edge. The edge feels significantly thinner and lighter and has more grip. This phone feels like a lead weight in comparison. This screen is a bit more vibrant in low light situations, but in daylight the edge is far superior. I personally like the bigger profile of this phone, but not when laying down trying to hold it in a elevated position. Simply too heavy without using two hands. I figured the problem with the flat blueish tinge is not an issue with the phone, but the actual OS, as it also appears to look similar on the Edge. The actual application boxes and menus are poorly colored on this OS. When viewing anything else, the color looks absolutely fine on both screens, with the Xperia having a slight edge in clarity and sharpness. The S7edge has a very smooth overlay and looks less pixelated in some cases. It's not until viewing documents and pictures/videos does the ppi of the sony stand out. The speakers on the xperia is superior in depth and direction but not as loud. The s7 edge does a better job suppressing bass which gives it a bit more clarity and loudness.The camera layout is better on the Xperia, but the edge beats it with smoothness and color reproduction. The default settings on the xperia is very bland, and takes some time setting it accordingly to get better money shots. The edge gives you a much more artistic profile strait out the box. The edge camera is also a bit faster, making it more stable. Video playback is better on the xperia given the flat edges and larger screen. I don't particular like the edge for watching videos given the curved sides. Lastly, contrary to my issues with the xperia being very slippery and heavy, i actually have a harder time grasping the edge do to the thin side profile, when scrolling through menus on the s7, it feels much more wobbly and loose in my hand.If weight is an issue i would go with the edge. This Xperia is a bigger fashion statement and the screen is slightly better. But i would say the mirror on the back of this phone yields more usefulness :). I've had three girls ask to use my phone and check out their faces with the mirror on the back."
"398652","Sony Xperia Z5 Premium E6853 5.5-Inch 4K UHD Display Factory Unlocked (BLACK) - International Stock No Warranty",5,"I absolutely LOVE THIS PHONE! I just did a ""forced upgrade"" from my previous phone, Sony Xperia Z1s to this, Sony Xperia Z5 Premium. The reason I say ""forced upgrade"" is due to the fact that my screen broke after about 2+ Years of service, I wouldn't have upgraded if it wasn't for that. Anyway I been having this phone on my radar since it was released, so I bought it. Seller shipped it quick, and it arrived ahead of time! :D The phone itself is awesome and the 4K is beautiful! The PS4 Remote Play feature is a HUGE PLUS! Works great, a little laggy at times but playable. The Chrome background is nice and camera is flawless. Phone is FAST! I received a Chinese Version of this phone, and I am using T-Mobile USA. The 4G LTE works but does not display, but with a Internet Speed Test you will see it is there. All in all, solid phone, and great purchase! 5 STARS!"

The box contained ear phones and a UCH-10 wall charger with US spec wall prongs with a USB cable. The phone connected to AT&T without incident but in order to get connected to mobile data, I had to download the specs. This is done though the phone settings.Very pleased with my purchase."

First, everything connected with T-mobile in new york, 4g lte, music is great with stereo and apt-x bluetooth,Hi-Res audio, 4k screen good. Now the bad, can't get this phone to work as a speaker phone so i don't have to keep it on my ear all the time also sound quality is not that great for phone calls. the battery barely last a day,so don't understand how they make claim of two days. So I'll give it a few day and make a decision on if i should return it because it cost to much to be having any problems. P.S (give u my verdict in a few days...)11/30- Lots of good features but the battery might be a deal breaker?... The battery really sucks for a premium phone and does not live up to it's claim...i mean if you turn everything off and don't use anything or the features it has, it last two days??? reminds me of HTC EVO i had years ago i had to buy an extended battery.....and the quick charger is not so quick. Might go back to note 4, last all day with no problems...like phone but pissed off with battery..12/1-I use this phone the same way i use my note 4, and have no problem with battery. but this phone barely last the whole day ..sending it back and will wait for z6, i brought this phone to use, not play how do you make battery last through the day"

"398682","Sony Xperia Z5 Premium E6853 5.5-Inch 4K UHD Display Factory Unlocked (BLACK) - International Stock No Warranty",3,"I'm a big Sony fan, and think they make great products, much more so than Samsung, LG or even HTC, and certainly on par with Apple. Sony products are well designed/engineered, solid build quality consistent with the long established reputation. Where as Samsung/LGs may have great specs. on paper and look good on the outside, their inside components are definitely lower quality in call quality, antenna reception or durability/design. Just remember there are no free lunches out there. Samsung LG is more like Honda/Toyota and will never be BMW/Mercedes. I have been using Sony smart mobile phone/tablets pretty much for the last 3 years now, and I'm hooked. From the Sony Xperia Z, to the Z Ultra, to the Z1s, Z3 smartphones, Z, Z2, Z3 tablet compact, to the Z4 tablet and now trying the Z5 premium. I have to say that While it's not Sony's fault in the SD810 processor, all the overheating issues are still true, no matter what Sony had tried, to engineer extra heatsinks to dissipate the extra heat generated by a horribly made Qualcomm SnapDragon 810. Qualcomm SD810 single handedly ruined this otherwise superior phone. From the 4k Screen, touch screen improvements, to the beautifully made premium look and feel, having all the makings of a topline product. In 90 degree+ ambient temperatures, normal use, no multimedia, the phone got hot enough that I can't take a call without a BT device, because putting it up against my face is too uncomfortably hot. Even though the phone doesn't shut down, but you'll feel like you're holding a hot potato in your hands and that's not good. This would have been a wonderful device, and potentially a top seller had it come with the SD820 chipset, what a combination that would be. This also explains why Sony decided to not sell any of the Z5s here in the US, as American tech savvy consumers will not likely put up with overheating issues. So I would say, if you love Sony's get the Z3s, no issues what so ever, or skip the Z5s and go straight to X series, but know you're no longer getting the best latest greatest from Sony with the Xperia Xs. Wish I had better news, but I'm struggling with upgrade choices as well."

But damn this thing is brittle, I don't put cases on my phones which was a huge mistake with this phone.I have had this phone for 3 months and already with normal wear and tear there are multiple visible scratches on the back and one on the glass on front of the phone. I have no idea how it got any of these scratches and non of my previous phones ever got a scratch on the glass. So now I don't know if it is waterproof as I don't know how deep the scratches go, and waterproof was a main quality when picking this phone.Also the Bluetooth is very sporadic when hooking to my car sometimes it works flawlessly other times I have to turn off the Bluetooth and turn it back on and resync with my car. Sometimes i have to do this multiple times. my previous phone didn't have this problem, the worse part about this is that it will play the audio through the phone which is muted so my audio books are playing in the background without me realizing it.There is also a Phantom touch that occurs on the top left randomly. so the menu on top will drop and raise and drop and raise. This is usually fixed by rubbing the top left of the phone but still annoying.The fingerprint scanner works about 40% of the time for no apparent reason.And the double tap to view screen is severely broken. This is the feature where double tapping the screen performs the same action as the power button. I had to disable this feature as it being in my pocket would randomly turn on the screen and just mash the dial buttons.On the plus side, it runs applications fairly well when I don't get the phantom touching going on and it hasn't butt dialed the cops yet. This is my first Sony phone and I probably will not be getting another one. Again this is all the things I have experienced in just 3 short months."

I carry with me a second cellphone (a cheap Samsung), both on t-mobile and the other phone has far much better signal all the time. This phone even struggles at times to find signal. I take really good care of this phone and now the headphones plug stopped working. Screen seems to have a false contact now and blinks all the time, making it extremely uncomfortable and annoying.Such a shame and disappointment. I might finally switch to iPhone or back to Galaxy.

"398714","Sony Xperia Z5 Premium E6853 5.5-Inch 4K UHD Display Factory Unlocked (BLACK) - International Stock No Warranty",5,"Robert here...I got my Z5 Premium this past Sunday and thus far, I absolutely LOVE this phone. After doing much research, I picked the single sim International version as it has capacity for faster download. I'm really impressed with the sound quality of this piece. I'd been using an old Droid3 as my Mp3 player and using a cheap ZTE Maven as my communicator with Cricket service. I had to take it to a Cricket store to get the mini sim cut to nano size (free). Being an E6853 vs the E6883, the product registration site wouldn't allow me to register so I had to call. It turns out mine was originally set for the Panamanian market. The young lady I spoke with, Alice, was very helpful with getting me set up for my 1 yr warranty.I chose the gold color and it is so beautiful. It's such a shame I have to cover it up with a TUDIA Slim-Fit MERGE case. The case actually is very nice though. I am really afraid of damaging this thing.I chose the Z5 Premium mostly for it's music handling prowess. This thing must have some Walkman genes in it. I think I found a replacement for my Zune with the cracked screen. I've read some iffy reviews regarding the fingerprint scanner but' I've not had any problem with it at all. It does not work when you first power up the phone and that's by design. The volume button location is a bit kooky but, I can get used to that. It seems a bit slow to sync with MediaPlayer. I'm gonna try and use a faster port. I've also heard of people complaining about a lack of image stability. Mine has it and it works very well. One cool thing I found with this being an unlocked phone is I'm able to use tethering on USB/Bluetooth and WiFi HotSpot with no restrictions.This is going to be a rolling review as I gain more experience with it so, I will update later.Update: 08/09/2016I've had my phone shut down/reboot on me twice. Both times it had been in my front jeans pocket. I bet it overheated and went into protection. Thinking back now, I wonder if this is why I've had so much trouble with my android phones. I've had them reboot on me before and this Xperia Z5 Premium is the first one that's performed the same after. I think I like that. I'm still going to work on that pocket thing though. Everything else is perfect so far."
"398715","Sony Xperia Z5 Premium E6853 5.5-Inch 4K UHD Display Factory Unlocked (BLACK) - International Stock No Warranty",5,"Switched from iPhone's iOS to Android and thought I'd try Sony's Z5, best decision ever! The phone arrived in 2 business days, put on the extra screen protector and an ultra-thin case (both purchased through Amazon), switched my SIM card over and it worked right out of the box. I noticed later that I wasn't able to setup Exchange mail for my work and the solution was to take it in to my carrier i.e. TMobile and have them enter their setup/configuration in the phone and this fixed all other lingering issues (as far as communication is concerned). The resolution on this thing is out of this world (I didn't realize it had a 4K screen until colleagues and friends who looked at the display marveled at the sharp and crisp display).I'm still getting used to Android 5.0 though (6 is not available for this phone yet, but soon is the rumor). I haven't found a push to talk button, but installed Dragon and it somewhat works like Siri.So far, the phone is a beast, worth every penny. The charger though takes forever to charger, I purchased an additional Sony charger on Amazon: OEM Sony Micro USB Charger (EP880+EC803) and this charges the phone much faster so maybe the Z5 shipped with a cheaper charger, I don't know.Anyway, I'm happy with this phone and purchased additional memory in case I need it,"

Also Don't has finally decided to get rid of the port covers except for the one where the SIM and microSDcard go in but that isn't an issue because it won't ever be opened.

"398731","Sony Xperia Z5 Premium E6853 5.5-Inch 4K UHD Display Factory Unlocked (BLACK) - International Stock No Warranty",5,"Let me start off by saying this phone is breathtaking, from the head turning design to the 3840 x 2160 resolution screen.-A few thoughts-Display: Before this phone I have never seen 4K resolution before with my own eyes so I only could imagine what it'll look like. Coming from my former Sony Xperia™ Z3 Dual I could always record video in 4K but never could see it because what the smartphone displayed was only 1920 x 1080P (1080p) so after receiving this phone and after downloading a few 4K videos and photos I can say I was not disappointed one bit it actually far pass my expectations! Colors pop, blacks are true and the Triluminos / X-Reaility technology brings it all together.Design: just got this Smartphone and already countless compliments, glass front and back the back isn't just ""mirror like"" it is a mirror! Which I find very useful when taking a 23mp selfie but it'll grab up fingerprints like crazy I find my self having to clean it off a few times a day but it's not a problem for me becuase I always clean my phones repeatedly anyways. The chrome framework is amazing and I love they put the two front facing speakers back on the edge of the screen like they used to have it in the Sony Xperia™ Z2 models very simplistic. I didn't not like the two speaker placements on the Z3 models, on the bottom left side you'll find a laser cut (Xperia) logo and 2 thumbs up for keeping the lanyard/charm part in the design!Features: Sony Xperia™ Z5 Premium is the Smartphone I decided to get over all the other premium Smartphones is because it offers so much more for my needs that the others simply just doesn't. Being able to turn on my PlayStation 4 from anywhere and play my games with a Dualshock 4 controller and play all my console games on the go is great. Holding the power button to show the (Record Screen) Option and livestream my gameplay right off my phone with no added application is good all on the WORLDS FIRST 5.5in 4K display. I've tested a lot of highly graphical games on here and it is a huge improvement over my old Z3 Dual, games run great! Have never overheated once. I gamed for over 8hrs and the battery life is so good, but watching videos a lot can drop the battery life pretty quick I'm guessing becuase it will upscale 1080P resolution to 1260P.Overall the shipping was fast the packaging was great in the box I got a pair of standard Sony earbuds, USB/Micro USB cable, wall adapter (not quick charge 2.0 which the phone do support), booklets. I have no complaints."
"398732","Sony Xperia Z5 Premium E6853 5.5-Inch 4K UHD Display Factory Unlocked (BLACK) - International Stock No Warranty",5,"I love this phone its super fast and the chrome is so nice just get it. Side note for those like me that have T-MOBILE IT DOES HAVE FULL 4G LTE do not put the APN settings by your self there is an option to DOWNLOAD INTERNET SETTINGS if you do this you will get LTE if you put them in your self you will just get HSPA+.

Everything was new in its package and well protected with bubble wrap in the box. I have had the phone for about 2 weeks and so far I am extremely happy with it. My last 2 phones have been iPhones and this phone is far better in every aspect. I've seen reviews of people complaining about the finger print scanner but I have not had any problems yet its extremely responsive to the touch. Also since I had read those reviews I simply used two Id fingerprint scanners for the same finger so that might have helped.

"398750","Sony Xperia Z5 Premium E6853 5.5-Inch 4K UHD Display Factory Unlocked (BLACK) - International Stock No Warranty",5,"This is my first ever Android Phone, having used BlackBerry since 2009. So most of my ""problems"" are just learning a new User Interface / Operating System (I'd have that problem regardless of what Android or Apple phone I switched to).One feature I didn't think I'd use is the fingerprint scanner. This scanner is accurate and trouble free. I love it. Compared to my wife's Note 5, it feels like a next generation technology (I don't tell her that). The USA Version of the regular Z5 has deleted this option. Big mistake, I'd get the international version of the Z5 regardless if I was getting the Premium or not. It's a very cool scanner, very impressed with the technology.I saw a few reviews saying that LTE doesn't work - it does. It doesn't display ""4GTLE"" it only displays ""4G"" but rest assured you're on LTE. I took a screenshot of a speed test using T-Mobile, USA but AT&T is also a GSM carrier and this phone has the bands for it as well.OK, I love the screen. I know that OLED is all the rage these days but I love this LCD screen because it can dim low in a dark room and can get very bright. The auto sensor works great on this phone too. The screen is beautiful.The camera is great! Coming from BlackBerry which always used subpar crappy cameras, I admit anything would have been an improvement but it takes great photos in line with my wife's Note 5 (probably better but we won't tell her).The front stereo speakers are fine. They are not as loud as one or two out there but are louder and clearer than many if not most.I love that it's water resistant.It looks beautiful. I got the Chrome but since I'm afraid to carry it naked and put a minimal transparent case on it, I'm wondering if I shouldn't have gone with the Gold. Any color choice is beautiful.As far as the 4K - The stock 4K video by Sony does look great but so does anything I'm viewing on here. I'd base my choice between Z5 or Z5 Premium based on what you prefer in phone size and screen size rather than 4K or not.I used to love BlackBerry because I liked carrying something different (they are very rare these days in the US) and I like this phone for the same reason. Everyone has either an Apple or a Samsung - but this Sony is something different. I really like it and recommend it.I intend on updating this review at the start of 2017 to give an update on how it works long term. But the initial quality is outstanding."

I think it is funny that other brands are just now water proofing their phones, Sony is way ahead of the curve in that aspect.

I've been babying it and taking care of the phone as much as possible, and in that time I've fallen in love. My personal experience is the UI is nice and clean, similar to stock Android with a few added extras, and it's very responsive. I know it's not 4K all the time, and until the Marshmallow update releases, there won't be much support as of yet, however the up scaling of videos in the YouTube app still look simply amazing. The camera isn't really want most hyped it up to be, but I find that it works well and edges out my Note 4 and my father's iPhone 6S Plus, which is perfect enough for me.From the general feel of the build quality, I'd have to mark Sony down as the ""Apple"" of Androids, since I haven't personally felt that the other Android devices did it for me. I tried the Note 5, S6 Edge Plus, iPhone 6S Plus, Nexus 6P, and multiple others, but the Xperia takes the cake in feeling the most premium to me. Calls sound crystal clear, and the front facing speakers, while not as powerful as some HTC or Motorola phones, still sound much better than my previous iPhone.All in all, love the device, hope Sony continues to push out updates for it in the future, and I may stick with them should they continue producing this type of quality into their devices."

Yes but its still worth the hype. Finger Print scanner on the Power key is fast and responsive every timeBattery Life is not exactly 48hrs but i keep everything on so i cant really benchmark.to achieve two days battery life, you have to enter stamina and ultra stamina mode which really turns the phone into a dumb large phone since you'll have to give up all the cool smart features for a very reduced battery consumption. the battery barely discharges if it is inactive and that gives me a comfort feel that i wont loose charge when the device is not in use"

I tried LG, Motorola, Samsung, HTC, iPhone, and Nexus 6P. I never gave Sony a chance, because I haven't seen them doing any major advertisements so I assumed it isn't a great phone. When I used the phone, I regret not buying Sony phones before. The phone is so user friendly and so clean of a software, even better than the pure Android like the ones, which comes in Nexus lineup.Basically you are buying quality !! a product that is well build and carefully crafted, and the software is perfectly modified.The only thing I don't like is the finger prints left on the back of the phone and the lack of the number of cases available to purchase.Update: Sadly I returned the phone, because I was getting Black Screen of Death during my calls. I can't do anything when I get it until the person I am talking to hang up then the screen turn back on. I tried all the fixes, but none of them worked, so I ended up returning it. I liked the phone so much, but I don't want to risk buying a phone that has a common issue since the Z2."

The fingerprint scanner works really amazing, much better than iphone 6s and galaxy S6. the screen is GORGEOUS, I can't explain it in words. the stereo speakers sounds very clear and super cool, but my old Xperia Z2 sounds a little louder than Z5 Premium. the led light is situated in the corner of the phone and is very small, for me, the led light of my old Z2 looks a lot better than this, positioned in the superior speaker and it was much larger than the Z5 one.The battery life is AMAZING and the quick charger works excelent, the phone charges completely in 1 hour approximately."

Even today I like it I am tempted to get a new Sony Phone but they aren't making them with the 4k Screen so I have declined to upgrade as of yet. The Camera is great. Remember Sony uses a full size pocket camera sensors in their phones they work great. Plus it is Water/Dirt/Dust Proof. I have taken it in the pool and at the beach, no problems. Just washed it off wit tap water after going into salt water."
"398785","Sony Xperia Z5 Premium E6853 5.5-Inch 4K UHD Display Factory Unlocked (BLACK) - International Stock No Warranty",5,"Probably the best phone in the US that no one has heard of unless you're a phone geek. I've had to work with phones for 10 years in the cellular industry and have seen many phones come and go. I have loved the recent Xperia series from Sony and always believe that they deliver the best products. In terms of phones, it's no secret that Sony has had a rocky history to say the least (Sony Ericsson partnership and a myriad of failures).I'll try and keep this short, but at least provide some more of a detailed review. Feel free to check the other versions of Z5 Premium (Chrome and Black) for others, but I notice the Gold version is sorely lacking any thorough review so here go:I've been using this phone for about month and don't typically review anything until I have had a chance to use it for more than a few days. First impressions can be misleading, so I let myself download apps, use throughout the day, take pictures, videos, etc and get a feel for the phone. I will say I have used a few other Xperias before. I am jumping from a Xperia Z1 I purchased in Japan about 2 years ago and loved that phone as well. Probably some Sony fanboy-ish going on here, but I will try and be as neutral as possible.Performance of the phone is fantastic. Everything moves very quick and smooth. Responds very well overall. One of my favorite features (yes it's nothing new, but performs so so well) is the fingerprint scanner. Like I said, I have worked in the cellular industry and I know the iPhone first brought this to the mainstream but I've really found myself using the fingerprint scanner a lot and the fact that the phone is larger, the scanner is actually a much easier way to unlock the screen than sliding up the unlock motion. And again, it just works so smooth!Perhaps my favorite part of this phone, and a big purchasing decision, is the camera. I have two little ones and whenever the family is out, I am typically default camera man, so there was a lot of debate with the wife as to whether I should invest in a good DSLR camera or buy the loaded Z5P phone. I haven't regretted my decision as the Z5P takes beautiful pictures, 23MP, though I find myself using the 20MP 16:9 format and even the Premium Auto mode is great for taking quick shots (using the quick wake up mode). Yes, it does take 4K video, which looks unbelievable. And Sony does have a little snapshot tool to take 8MP screenshots of 4K video stills if you so desire. The 4K SCREEN ON THE PHONE looks phenomenal. I've read a lot of tech sites instantly saying that the 4K screen is unnecessary and a gimmick, however to be honest, I'm not sure what screen they're looking at. I've put up the Z5P screen next to my Z1 (1080p) and for me personally I can definitely tell a difference. The Z5P is so much clearer and the colors are very vibrant (though not overly saturated). Also, the camera has a 1080p/60fps video mode which also works great. Lastly, the camera has an insanely fast autofocus, which does actually autofocus, which helps with quickshots. Again, camera alone was worth the purchase.Battery: Always a touchy issue with so many and always the quickest to get people to stop buying your product. With heavy usage, and again, from experience, I know what constitutes heavy, you can still EASILY get a days worth of usage on your phone. I have tried several times to intentionally kill my battery doing things that typically kill other phones instantly--biggies being streaming video, games, GPS, camera and the often under-appreciated phone calls/video(data) calls. I don't think people really know how much phone calls kill your battery, but again, tried to get it to under a day and it didn't really work. I would still have about 20% at the end (say 9-10pm) of the day. Now again, I don't have the luxury of literally sitting down from 8am-8pm doing nothing but that, but throughout the day, I would watch/play/listen/etc and still had enough battery to do more by the time I put the kids to bed. Also, the last few days I've been trying something else and seeing how the battery preserves itself. During work, I don't heavily use my phone (because, you know, I'm WORKING), but even at that with 2 email accounts synced up, and other various services running (mind you, no facebook, twitter or other SNS-sorry no social life :) I still do some messaging but still have about 80% at the end of day. I DO NOT charge the phone overnight, lose a couple more percentages and start day 2 with about 75-78%. I then continue to work again and continue to drain battery and again still have a moderate (about 65%) battery. Now again, by no means am I saying this is an end-all guide to the 5-day battery phone, but again, for practical usage for people who don't live on their phones 24/7 I can easily get 3 working days of usage on my phone, maybe 4 if I push it. Again many factors go into this, screen brightness, accounts, etc. but I have been thrilled with my battery life.Ok, I'm rambling too much so I'll wrap it up. Quickly wanted to address a negative:Bezel--never understood why people think this phone has larger bezels than others. I think there was someone who actually measured the % of screen that the bezels take up and Xperias actually have a better % than iPhones and some others. Now one thing I will note is the 3 touch buttons (back, home and apps) are taking up part of the 5.5"" screen. While others, like Samsung have the buttons underneath so you get a true full screen. Anyway, minor design gripe, but still more than enough real estate on the screen.Little extra here too, again, read about how some people thought it was such a novelty that the phone was water/dust proof rated yet kept the charging port open. If you have experience with Japanese phones, you probably know that waterproofing phones is very old news. Almost all Japanese phone manufacturers, Sony, Sharp, Kyocera, make all their phones waterproof because many Japanese take their phones in the bath with them. In fact, my wife has a basic Sharp Aquos from about 2-2 1/2 years ago that is also waterproof, but already had the open charging port design implemented. Again, just a little tidbit there about the novelty of waterproofing phones, so yes the charging port is open, but the phone is still sealed. I also can attest to this as I have used the phone for pictures in not only heavy rainfall but also at a waterpark (my little girl drenched my phone but totally fine).Alright, I'm done now. Hopefully this helped out and if you purchase it, ENJOY!"

Never bought an Apple, never thought following the crowd was the best way to go. Dollar to Dollar, Sony beats Apple. Waterproof, scratch resistant, and fingerprints don't really show unless you really got greasy ones, fantastic display, great sound quality. I just found it a bit big to hold in my palm, and the volume toggle is not well placed as many have complained about....so why doesn't Sony change it? 4K pics are great and so is the camera, but don't think it's as good as a ""regular"" camera with a bigger lens. Plus, buildings and tress may ""bend"" a bit depending on your picture angle which is kinda like a cheaper point and shoot. But, then again, it's a very small lens and so you will get some grainy pictures as well regardless of the megapixels."

Some are great upgrades from my previous phone, the Z1.This is just personal preferences, but I liked the Walkman App before it turned to the Android Lollipop Music App.Lollipop is just not type. I will probably revert to KitKat because I love the UI and overall feel better than Lollipop's.The power button is slightly sunken. Unlike the Z1, where it was easily accessible with a slightly outward button.Lastly, and yes, this is was shocking for me as well. The screen.With a whopping 806 PPI (Pixels Per Inch) 4K screen, you would expect the display quality to be as clear as looking out a window. So unless I bought a faulty phone, I kid you not, the screen looks pixelated. Yes, you read that right. Pixelated.Now, I know that everything except the Album and Video apps are down-scaled to 1080P. So I tested the 4K photos and videos, and to my astonishment, there they are! Still looking pixelated, even at 4K. I had to look through a magnifying glass to see them up close. I compared my old Z1, my dad's Z Ultra and the Z5 Premium. Again big surprise, both my old Z1 and the Z ultra pixels can barely be seen, with very faint black lines separating the pixels, while on the Z5 Premium the lines were considerably much more noticeable.Looking at all three phones from a normal distance, the Z1 and Z Ultra's screens do not look pixelated at all, while my Z5, even from a fair distance, you can still faintly see the pixelation.Basically, I have phone with a 4K display, but it almost makes me feel like it has a WVGA display.Lastly, I've never seen a phone reflect dots from a turned off display before. My Z5 Premium for some reason reflects dots, pixels, I don't know what they are in a squared grid pattern whenever the screen reflects light. Whether its from the Sun or any regular light, you will clearly see them. Regardless if whether the phone is on or not.Conclusion.The phone itself is awesome. Great new features, great audio, superb built quality and respectable camera.It might just be my phone, its too early to tell, since a lot people don't own this phone yet, but make sure to check with others who own the phone and ask if they see pixelation or have a faulty displays in their Z5 Premium as well.[[ASIN:B0171GYNGW Sony Xperia Z5 Premium E6853 5.5-Inch 4K UHD Display Factory Unlocked (CHROME) - International Stock No Warranty]"

I'm coming from a Galaxy Note 3 due to the Note 5 not having expandable storage and disappointing me in almost every aspect.First off, after using this phone I immediately fell in love with the waterproof feature. I will never buy another phone that doesn't have resistance to water, I mean honestly the technology is there, if the big companies cant get on the train and get this feature I will simply stay away. I also was able to easily expand my storage by 128gb with a micro SD. The 4K display is something I could live without but it is a nice feature and I can't complain. Battery life is very good for this device I am able to fall asleep with 40% battery from a day of moderate use, wake up and use the phone till mid afternoon with no problems. Charging is pretty fast also. I can leave the phone and forget about it for about an hour and come back to a ton of battery life.I removed a star for the fingerprint scanner getting a slight scratch within the first month of use and rendering it un-usable. Would be nice to use it but not a whole lot I can do about it. I think the next phone I will get will have to have usb type c with super high speed data transfer. We shall see what the future holds."

Super fast camera with the best image sensor I've seen (also excellent in low light), a super sharp display-even in sunny conditions, super snappy operation and just an overall premium feel.

It ran a bit sluggish, in addition, out of the box the battery was horrible, and I am coming from the Sony Xperia Z3 which I only had to charge once a day. I returned the S7 $800 paperweight that T-Mobile attempted to charge me and decided to purchase the Xperia Z5 since I loved the Z3 so much, but with some of the negative reviews I almost did not purchased the phone. I am so happy that I did not listen to the negative reviews and did it. It has been less than 24hours and this phone is absolutely amazing! I have it running on T-Mobile’s sim card and the service is great, no overheating, in addition I purchased a solid case to keep this amazing phone protected. I think that this is the best phone on the market right now and I wish that people would provide accurate feedback so that others who want to take a chance will also have an amazing experience as I am having. Please, if you are thinking about this phone and already know how solid Sony is, don’t get despair by the negative reviews, take a chance on a brand that you know and get the phone! Life is too short to just settle for anything, treat yourself and live your life!"
"398991","Sony Xperia Z5 Unlocked Phone - Retail Packaging - Gold",5,"Coming from a Galaxy S3 (with Zerolemon extended battery) that lasted 3+ years, the difference between the two phones is night and day. Definitely larger, less curvy, and thinner. The Z5 feels very premium if not a little on the fragile side. I've heard reports in the past (especially with the Z3) of the screens self-cracking, so I wasn't going to take any chances with this phone. I also ordered a tempered glass screen protector and a clear TPU case and threw those on before anything else.It's only been a few days, and these are my observations thus far:Spent the first two days playing with the Z5 and updating it. An update was available right out of the box. This can be done either through the phone itself or by connecting it to the computer and installing Sony's Xperia Companion software (which I didn't mind.) There were a lot of features to play with. Won't be getting bored any time soon. One thing to note: the volume buttons are on the lower-right side of the phone, as opposed to the Galaxy S3's upper-left side. It takes some getting used to. Some have said that it's simply poor placement, but it's really not that bad. It might be annoying if you're right-handed, but I could see left-handers having an easier time. It's left-hander friendly! And for the record, I could care less about the lack of fingerprint scanner support. I don't think it's a needed feature, and definitely not a deal-breaker. My S3 didn't have one, so I don't believe I'm missing out.Today was my first real day of having it in my pocket while at work. I don't wear tight pants, but the phone is thinner than what I'm used to, so I remained aware of the potential of it bending in my pocket. I charged the phone overnight to 100%. As of this writing (around 4:13 PM), I'm down to 76%. Granted, I wasn't using the camera heavily or playing any games yet or had the screen on for a prolonged period of time. But as it stands, I can easily get two days out of this thing.Here's something of interest: I guess Android 6.0 has a feature called ""Double-tap to Wake"", where you can simply double-tap the display and it'll come on so you can unlock the device from there. Very nice feature! I always think that I'm wearing down the power button with the constant screen turning on and off. BUT, over the course of the work day and having the phone in my pocket, I noticed on two occasions that the flashlight mode was shining in my pocket. Somehow, it enabled itself in my pocket and I know I locked the device. I also noticed that my bluetooth was on, and I had no recollection of turning that on as well. I suspect that the ""Double-tap to Wake"" feature is so sensitive that it's turning on in my pocket, sliding around, and sliding the notification bar down and pressing random settings off and on. Even in my pocket, the screen must be very sensitive! There's apparently a ""Glove mode"" that makes it easier to interact with the screen while wearing gloves. This mode was turned off. I've since turned off the ""Double-tap to Wake"" feature. I'll report back if I'm still having issues with this."

All the basic performance requirements of a phone at the price point were met. After a few months of use, there have been some significant issues and I am now at a point where I need to replace the device all together. This is really disappointing because I usually get 2 to 3 product cycles out of a phone;I bought this to replace my S5 Galaxy. Here is a chronological list of issues developing1) 1 week - Blue tooth connectivity/call prioritization. Improved after system update2) 1 month - Overheating issues &coating on lens started to scratch off... The camera quality suffered as a result.3) 2 months - Vertical lines in the display when first turned on, that would fade away.4) 3 months - Vertical lines became like looking through a mesh, eventually the screen completely failed. It just displays lines and shades.I hope this helps, don't make the same mistake: buy a Samsung S7"

I didn't really care about or want the finger print scanner so I am not torn up about that. The phone itself is understated ""chic"" I suppose. Its solid in the hand, has a nice little loop notch which was an unexpected surprise that will probably go unused here.I am particularly impressed with the headphone output on this phone. resolution and quality of output are on par with an HTC One M8. The M8 has the edge in absolute power output but this phone is capable of making good use of a Tidal account on the go. Has enough power to drive the Shure Srh-1840 to uncomfortable levels. Doesn't seem to mind hte ultra-low impedance of the Shure SE846 although absolute refinement of sound seems to take a slight hit compared to the HTC one M8. Four hours of Tidal streaming @ CD quality seemed to eat about 10% of the phones battery driving the SRH-1840 and the screen mostly off which I consider to be another solid showing.Especially for the money, I feel its quite a nice device."

"399014","Sony Xperia Z5 Unlocked Phone - Retail Packaging - Gold",2,"Coming from a Z3, I had very very high expectations, but due to the recent development of a flickering display issue, I decided to give the Z5 a chance.Within 3 hours of arrival, and fresh off a system update, the phone was shutting down the camera app due to thermal issues, and I was getting notifications about temperature problems. Whether I was taking 8mp images or 60fps full hd, same problem. If a phone's primary advertising feature is its camera's capabilities, those features should work.The display has a very odd tint to it, making whites appear red/purple, and giving other colors a weird cast, regardless of the xreality settings...maybe they put too much red in their Triluminos display technology...Adjusting the color calibration brings it closer to white, but gives things a greyish cast as well.While attempting to charge the phone using the supplied adapter, it was discharging faster than it could charge...all I was doing was downloading apps through google play, and had the screen on.Maybe I just got a dud, but Sony support killed it for me when their only solution was to check the return policy of the store from which I purchased, and then get sarcastic with me when I asked if that's all they were able to suggest.If this were priced as a midrange phone, I'd be more lenient, but at more than half a grand this is just unacceptable.Given that Sony has shuddered direct US sales of this phone, and their support is all overseas, I think I'm done with Sony Mobile. Too bad, too, cause the Z3 really was incredible."

"399026","Sony Xperia Z5 Unlocked Phone - Retail Packaging - Gold",1,"Severe fever"
"399027","Sony Xperia Z5 Unlocked Phone - Retail Packaging - Gold",4,"I was looking for a phone that had an aluminum body and was water resistant. I also wanted an unlocked phone because I do tend to leave the states every once and a while. I've had it about a month now and I am very please with it - the phone feels solid in your hand, it has a great weight to it. The camera is AWESOME with the quick auto-focus feature, the pictures are beautiful with a 23MP camera. The battery life is pretty good too, and it charges pretty quickly when using the factory charger, so if you're on the go you can squeeze in a few hours of battery life with 15 minutes of charging.I was a little apprehensive that the screen isn't gorilla glass; my screens tend to crack over time, which is why a screen protector and case were a MUST! This phone is SOLID, it does have a little software quirks since it is unlocked - like a 'Cell Information' notification that can be a bit of a pain to keep off the notification bar (If you want to remove it you have to go to Settings->Sound and Notifications->App Notifications->Cell Information->click on the i in a circle-> Force Stop -- the notification will come back upon restart); a small Snapchat quirk that makes you do a bit of extra work to get to the right screen (some of the menu options dont function on certain screens, you have to go to the main camera screen before being able to see other people's stories). I am sure there are other small app quirks too, but these small quirks are easy for me to look over for a great water-resistant aluminum bodied unlocked smartphone that costs under 500 bucks. Recommended for those that like solid unlocked android phones. Slap a screen protector on it, get a case, and live yo life like a boss with a new phone."

"399032","Sony Xperia Z5 Unlocked Phone - Retail Packaging - Gold",2,"Awesome phone. The camera is probably one of the best available. Only problem is that it is the most delicate mobile phone on the market. The phone fell out of my pants pocket, and even with a case, the screen cracked. I have had iPhones and Galaxy phones in the past that have survived many falls with zero issues, but this Sony was unable to endure one fall. Sony has a great product, but they cheaped out on the screen. I called Sony to see if I could pay them for the repair, taking full responsibility for the drop, but the phone rep stated that they do not do out-of-warranty work for US customers."

And i don't blame sony for this. for couple of years, Android cellphones industry is in static situation and nothing new or awesome is coming out. every renowned brand's flagship phones are circling around, camera, water proof, sound, finger prints, resolution etc. nothing special or extra ordinary coming out. i gave 4 stars because battery life is not improved, i was expecting better performance in battery life."

"399039","Sony Xperia Z5 Unlocked Phone - Retail Packaging - Gold",5,"I'm a big gamer, and I don't need to go over those features for you for the thousandth time, but after deciding not to upgrade to the Sony Xperia Z3 or Z3+ due to the heating issues, and a couple other reasons, I drooled over the Xperia Z5 specs for months waiting to buy this phone in the U.S. with a warranty. I finally got it through Amazon, and this phone is absolutely blazing fast! However the number the Sony Guy provided me to purchase an additional warranty didn't pan out, I still feel this phone deserves a full 5 star review. The camera, the graphics, the power, The playstation integration for gamers, this phone is exactly what I have been waiting for to upgrade for my trusty Xperia Play R800 and I couldn't be happier. Unless of course it slid out into a PlayStation controller like the old R800's but the display, camera, and about everything else make this phone so vastly superior in every aspect. I'm not even mad the U.S. version didn't get a finger print scanner as there is a ton of apps for that, and that wasn't a selling point anyways for me. I am in love all over again with another great Xperia!"
"399040","Sony Xperia Z5 Unlocked Phone - Retail Packaging - Gold",5,"I have used Xperia z5 for one week now.Super camera. I now don't need to carry compact camera with me. Just aim and shoot with my Z5. Focus fast and no more blurry pictures. Display is sharp and clear even under bright California sky. Phone function is as great as expected. Web browsing is fast... I don't use my I-pad anymore. Sorry, I had to move to AT&T from Verizon... more than 15 years loyal customer."
"399041","Sony Xperia Z5 Unlocked Phone - Retail Packaging - Gold",4,"Loving the phone so far. However reception isn't that great in certain areas. The camera is phenomenal for a phone."
"399042","Sony Xperia Z5 Unlocked Phone - Retail Packaging - Gold",5,"I absolutely love this phone! Huge upgrade from the Sony Xperia Z3V that I previously was using, so it is actually my first time using Lollipop and also many other features that the Z5 has to offer. Buttery Smooth performance along with speed and the camera is just amazing, so many great things about this phone that I can go on about. I have read that people are upset about Sony not including the fingerprint scanner from the power button which to me is not a big deal since I have not yet to use it on my previous devices so I honestly could care less of the feature and I also doubt that I would ever use it if it was included. However this phone is great and I am enjoying it."
"399043","Sony Xperia Z5 Unlocked Phone - Retail Packaging - Gold",5,"I am impressed with the quality of this phone,The Xperia Z5 display excellent color reproduction and sharpness, has an excellent image, the glass screen feels sturdy, the software and hardware environment respond quickly and smooth, I have been using continuously and has no overheating by the continued use of streaming as z3,The Xperia Z5 is very well put together, with Gorilla Glass 4 on the front and back, an aluminum frame and rubber bumpers on the corners to help absorb shock if the phone is dropped,The camera has truly excellent auto-focus,regarding the battery of sony phone I do not see a big difference compared to other phones like Samsung or IPhone S6,but The biggest departure in design terms, is the look of the power button. Sony’s trademark protruding chrome-effect circle, which has been around for years, has now been replaced by an elongated lozenge, slightly inset from the edge to prevent you accidentally pressing it.I particularly recommend this phone to a friend."
"399044","Sony Xperia Z5 Unlocked Phone - Retail Packaging - Gold",5,"Upgraded to this phone from a T-Mobile Xperia Z (3 1/2 years old) which was locked; therefore I'm using the unlocked Z5 on T-Mobile and have not had any issues. I have a LTE signal on the device. One of the biggest pros for the phone is that its nearly stock android and all apps except a few can be removed completely from the device (for example i was able to remove the Google+ app which i was unable to do before). The phone is fast and fluid and i have not had any lagg on it. For me the camera is superb but I'm not a big photographer unless I'm at a concert or something. The auto-focus is extremely fast to where i don't even see it focus unless i manually use my finger to focus on a particular item. No regrets with my purchase"
"399045","Sony Xperia Z5 Unlocked Phone - Retail Packaging - Gold",5,"Received the phone yesterday and it is as expected. I haven't gotten the device soaked yet but it is fast, runs cool, and the display looks great even in direct daylight. Didn't get outrageously warm and the battery life looks like it will outperform what reviews led me to expect. I didn't really care about or want the finger print scanner so I am not torn up about that. The phone itself is understated ""chic"" I suppose. Its solid in the hand, has a nice little loop notch which was an unexpected surprise that will probably go unused here.I am particularly impressed with the headphone output on this phone. resolution and quality of output are on par with an HTC One M8. The M8 has the edge in absolute power output but this phone is capable of making good use of a Tidal account on the go. Has enough power to drive the Shure Srh-1840 to uncomfortable levels. Doesn't seem to mind hte ultra-low impedance of the Shure SE846 although absolute refinement of sound seems to take a slight hit compared to the HTC one M8. Four hours of Tidal streaming @ CD quality seemed to eat about 10% of the phones battery driving the SRH-1840 and the screen mostly off which I consider to be another solid showing.Especially for the money, I feel its quite a nice device."
"399046","Sony Xperia Z5 Unlocked Phone - Retail Packaging - Gold",3,"Wifi and service sucks through this phone for some reason. Probably won't buy another one."
"399047","Sony Xperia Z5 Unlocked Phone - Retail Packaging - Gold",4,"Even when this item is sold as ""New"" the box was open and dirty, as when it has been manipulated by several hands, the cell phone plastic cover was from other cell phone because it was shorter and in different shape. When I turned on the cell it started to update some apps, which is normal, and it was trying to update the software version, the cell phone tried several times without success, I had to do it using my computer. Definitely not recommended for people who likes products just ""plug and play"". The cell phone by itself is really good."
"399048","Sony Xperia Z5 Unlocked Phone - Retail Packaging - Gold",5,"I have only had Sony cell phones for over 10 years. Nice phone and very happy with this purchase."

"399057","Sony Xperia Z5 Unlocked Phone - Retail Packaging - White",5,"Extremely happy with this phone. It was finally time to upgrade from my Xperia TL, and when I got a chance to try out the Z5 I was more than satisfied. I'm on a family plan with phones including an Iphone 6 and a Samsung Galaxy 7, and I definitely preferred the Z5. Super fast camera with the best image sensor I've seen (also excellent in low light), a super sharp display-even in sunny conditions, super snappy operation and just an overall premium feel. I hope that Sony can get their issues with US carriers sorted out because more people should have access to the excellent Xperia line of phones."
"399058","Sony Xperia Z5 Unlocked Phone - Retail Packaging - White",5,"Love it. Got here quick works flawlessly. No complaints about the phone. Takes a bit to get used to from iPhone and typing/browsing still annoying but everything else superior. Doubt I'll be going back to iPhone."
"399059","Sony Xperia Z5 Unlocked Phone - Retail Packaging - White",1,"I have been a loyal Sony Xperia Z1S and Z3 user and wanted to upgrade to the Z5. Xperia Z5 crashed repeatedly during startup process and then continued to do so with minimal use, even trying to open main menu screens. Factory reset did not fix anything. Returned it within a day and I'll have to wait for the next model to see if they ironed out the kinks."
"399060","Sony Xperia Z5 Unlocked Phone - Retail Packaging - White",5,"Seller 100% recommended. He complied with everything. !!!"
"399061","Sony Xperia Z5 Unlocked Phone - Retail Packaging - White",5,"I felt obligated to leave a feedback because some of the negative and inaccurate reviews users were leaving led me to believe that this phone was not a good buy. I just had the all great and mighty Samsung S7 and I absolutely hated the phone! It ran a bit sluggish, in addition, out of the box the battery was horrible, and I am coming from the Sony Xperia Z3 which I only had to charge once a day. I returned the S7 $800 paperweight that T-Mobile attempted to charge me and decided to purchase the Xperia Z5 since I loved the Z3 so much, but with some of the negative reviews I almost did not purchased the phone. I am so happy that I did not listen to the negative reviews and did it. It has been less than 24hours and this phone is absolutely amazing! I have it running on T-Mobile’s sim card and the service is great, no overheating, in addition I purchased a solid case to keep this amazing phone protected. I think that this is the best phone on the market right now and I wish that people would provide accurate feedback so that others who want to take a chance will also have an amazing experience as I am having. Please, if you are thinking about this phone and already know how solid Sony is, don’t get despair by the negative reviews, take a chance on a brand that you know and get the phone! Life is too short to just settle for anything, treat yourself and live your life!"
"399062","Sony Xperia Z5 Unlocked Phone - Retail Packaging - White",5,"Coming from a Galaxy S3 (with Zerolemon extended battery) that lasted 3+ years, the difference between the two phones is night and day. Definitely larger, less curvy, and thinner. The Z5 feels very premium if not a little on the fragile side. I've heard reports in the past (especially with the Z3) of the screens self-cracking, so I wasn't going to take any chances with this phone. I also ordered a tempered glass screen protector and a clear TPU case and threw those on before anything else.It's only been a few days, and these are my observations thus far:Spent the first two days playing with the Z5 and updating it. An update was available right out of the box. This can be done either through the phone itself or by connecting it to the computer and installing Sony's Xperia Companion software (which I didn't mind.) There were a lot of features to play with. Won't be getting bored any time soon. One thing to note: the volume buttons are on the lower-right side of the phone, as opposed to the Galaxy S3's upper-left side. It takes some getting used to. Some have said that it's simply poor placement, but it's really not that bad. It might be annoying if you're right-handed, but I could see left-handers having an easier time. It's left-hander friendly! And for the record, I could care less about the lack of fingerprint scanner support. I don't think it's a needed feature, and definitely not a deal-breaker. My S3 didn't have one, so I don't believe I'm missing out.Today was my first real day of having it in my pocket while at work. I don't wear tight pants, but the phone is thinner than what I'm used to, so I remained aware of the potential of it bending in my pocket. I charged the phone overnight to 100%. As of this writing (around 4:13 PM), I'm down to 76%. Granted, I wasn't using the camera heavily or playing any games yet or had the screen on for a prolonged period of time. But as it stands, I can easily get two days out of this thing.Here's something of interest: I guess Android 6.0 has a feature called ""Double-tap to Wake"", where you can simply double-tap the display and it'll come on so you can unlock the device from there. Very nice feature! I always think that I'm wearing down the power button with the constant screen turning on and off. BUT, over the course of the work day and having the phone in my pocket, I noticed on two occasions that the flashlight mode was shining in my pocket. Somehow, it enabled itself in my pocket and I know I locked the device. I also noticed that my bluetooth was on, and I had no recollection of turning that on as well. I suspect that the ""Double-tap to Wake"" feature is so sensitive that it's turning on in my pocket, sliding around, and sliding the notification bar down and pressing random settings off and on. Even in my pocket, the screen must be very sensitive! There's apparently a ""Glove mode"" that makes it easier to interact with the screen while wearing gloves. This mode was turned off. I've since turned off the ""Double-tap to Wake"" feature. I'll report back if I'm still having issues with this."

The camera is AWESOME with the quick auto-focus feature, the pictures are beautiful with a 23MP camera. The battery life is pretty good too, and it charges pretty quickly when using the factory charger, so if you're on the go you can squeeze in a few hours of battery life with 15 minutes of charging.I was a little apprehensive that the screen isn't gorilla glass; my screens tend to crack over time, which is why a screen protector and case were a MUST! This phone is SOLID, it does have a little software quirks since it is unlocked - like a 'Cell Information' notification that can be a bit of a pain to keep off the notification bar (If you want to remove it you have to go to Settings->Sound and Notifications->App Notifications->Cell Information->click on the i in a circle-> Force Stop -- the notification will come back upon restart); a small Snapchat quirk that makes you do a bit of extra work to get to the right screen (some of the menu options dont function on certain screens, you have to go to the main camera screen before being able to see other people's stories). I am sure there are other small app quirks too, but these small quirks are easy for me to look over for a great water-resistant aluminum bodied unlocked smartphone that costs under 500 bucks. Recommended for those that like solid unlocked android phones. Slap a screen protector on it, get a case, and live yo life like a boss with a new phone."

"399092","Sony Xperia Z5 Unlocked Phone - Retail Packaging - White",5,"The best phone I've had since my XPERIA Z3! Sony knows how to make a beautiful, speedy, and premium-looking device. If you're looking for an Android-based phone, look no further, the XPERIA Z5 is the best I've had yet!"
"399093","Sony Xperia Z5 Unlocked Phone - Retail Packaging - White",2,"Awesome phone. The camera is probably one of the best available. Only problem is that it is the most delicate mobile phone on the market. The phone fell out of my pants pocket, and even with a case, the screen cracked. I have had iPhones and Galaxy phones in the past that have survived many falls with zero issues, but this Sony was unable to endure one fall. Sony has a great product, but they cheaped out on the screen. I called Sony to see if I could pay them for the repair, taking full responsibility for the drop, but the phone rep stated that they do not do out-of-warranty work for US customers."

"399097","Sony Xperia Z5 Unlocked Phone - Retail Packaging - White",4,"i am a loyal Sony fan, using Sony phones since their W series of walkman phones, W700, W750I W850i, and then used xperia Z1, Z2, Z3, and now i got my hands on Xperia Z5. first of all i must confess xperia Z2 was the best xperia series phone till now. as far as Z5 is concerned, it is a typical Sony phone with awesome camera, 4k video, brilliant walkman and unbelievable bright resolution, but having said that, there is no WOW factor. nothing EXTRA ORDINARY new. And i don't blame sony for this. for couple of years, Android cellphones industry is in static situation and nothing new or awesome is coming out. every renowned brand's flagship phones are circling around, camera, water proof, sound, finger prints, resolution etc. nothing special or extra ordinary coming out. i gave 4 stars because battery life is not improved, i was expecting better performance in battery life."

"399100","Sony Xperia Z5 Unlocked Phone - Retail Packaging - White",5,"I'm a big gamer, and I don't need to go over those features for you for the thousandth time, but after deciding not to upgrade to the Sony Xperia Z3 or Z3+ due to the heating issues, and a couple other reasons, I drooled over the Xperia Z5 specs for months waiting to buy this phone in the U.S. with a warranty. I finally got it through Amazon, and this phone is absolutely blazing fast! However the number the Sony Guy provided me to purchase an additional warranty didn't pan out, I still feel this phone deserves a full 5 star review. The camera, the graphics, the power, The playstation integration for gamers, this phone is exactly what I have been waiting for to upgrade for my trusty Xperia Play R800 and I couldn't be happier. Unless of course it slid out into a PlayStation controller like the old R800's but the display, camera, and about everything else make this phone so vastly superior in every aspect. I'm not even mad the U.S. version didn't get a finger print scanner as there is a ton of apps for that, and that wasn't a selling point anyways for me. I am in love all over again with another great Xperia!"
"399101","Sony Xperia Z5 Unlocked Phone - Retail Packaging - White",5,"I have used Xperia z5 for one week now.Super camera. I now don't need to carry compact camera with me. Just aim and shoot with my Z5. Focus fast and no more blurry pictures. Display is sharp and clear even under bright California sky. Phone function is as great as expected. Web browsing is fast... I don't use my I-pad anymore. Sorry, I had to move to AT&T from Verizon... more than 15 years loyal customer."
"399102","Sony Xperia Z5 Unlocked Phone - Retail Packaging - White",4,"Loving the phone so far. However reception isn't that great in certain areas. The camera is phenomenal for a phone."
"399103","Sony Xperia Z5 Unlocked Phone - Retail Packaging - White",5,"I absolutely love this phone! Huge upgrade from the Sony Xperia Z3V that I previously was using, so it is actually my first time using Lollipop and also many other features that the Z5 has to offer. Buttery Smooth performance along with speed and the camera is just amazing, so many great things about this phone that I can go on about. I have read that people are upset about Sony not including the fingerprint scanner from the power button which to me is not a big deal since I have not yet to use it on my previous devices so I honestly could care less of the feature and I also doubt that I would ever use it if it was included. However this phone is great and I am enjoying it."
"399104","Sony Xperia Z5 Unlocked Phone - Retail Packaging - White",5,"I am impressed with the quality of this phone,The Xperia Z5 display excellent color reproduction and sharpness, has an excellent image, the glass screen feels sturdy, the software and hardware environment respond quickly and smooth, I have been using continuously and has no overheating by the continued use of streaming as z3,The Xperia Z5 is very well put together, with Gorilla Glass 4 on the front and back, an aluminum frame and rubber bumpers on the corners to help absorb shock if the phone is dropped,The camera has truly excellent auto-focus,regarding the battery of sony phone I do not see a big difference compared to other phones like Samsung or IPhone S6,but The biggest departure in design terms, is the look of the power button. Sony’s trademark protruding chrome-effect circle, which has been around for years, has now been replaced by an elongated lozenge, slightly inset from the edge to prevent you accidentally pressing it.I particularly recommend this phone to a friend."
"399105","Sony Xperia Z5 Unlocked Phone - Retail Packaging - White",5,"Upgraded to this phone from a T-Mobile Xperia Z (3 1/2 years old) which was locked; therefore I'm using the unlocked Z5 on T-Mobile and have not had any issues. I have a LTE signal on the device. One of the biggest pros for the phone is that its nearly stock android and all apps except a few can be removed completely from the device (for example i was able to remove the Google+ app which i was unable to do before). The phone is fast and fluid and i have not had any lagg on it. For me the camera is superb but I'm not a big photographer unless I'm at a concert or something. The auto-focus is extremely fast to where i don't even see it focus unless i manually use my finger to focus on a particular item. No regrets with my purchase"
"399106","Sony Xperia Z5 Unlocked Phone - Retail Packaging - White",5,"Received the phone yesterday and it is as expected. I haven't gotten the device soaked yet but it is fast, runs cool, and the display looks great even in direct daylight. Didn't get outrageously warm and the battery life looks like it will outperform what reviews led me to expect. I didn't really care about or want the finger print scanner so I am not torn up about that. The phone itself is understated ""chic"" I suppose. Its solid in the hand, has a nice little loop notch which was an unexpected surprise that will probably go unused here.I am particularly impressed with the headphone output on this phone. resolution and quality of output are on par with an HTC One M8. The M8 has the edge in absolute power output but this phone is capable of making good use of a Tidal account on the go. Has enough power to drive the Shure Srh-1840 to uncomfortable levels. Doesn't seem to mind hte ultra-low impedance of the Shure SE846 although absolute refinement of sound seems to take a slight hit compared to the HTC one M8. Four hours of Tidal streaming @ CD quality seemed to eat about 10% of the phones battery driving the SRH-1840 and the screen mostly off which I consider to be another solid showing.Especially for the money, I feel its quite a nice device."
"399107","Sony Xperia Z5 Unlocked Phone - Retail Packaging - White",1,"This review is after 3 months of ownership:The first few weeks I was pleased with the phone in general. All the basic performance requirements of a phone at the price point were met. After a few months of use, there have been some significant issues and I am now at a point where I need to replace the device all together. This is really disappointing because I usually get 2 to 3 product cycles out of a phone;I bought this to replace my S5 Galaxy. Here is a chronological list of issues developing1) 1 week - Blue tooth connectivity/call prioritization. Improved after system update2) 1 month - Overheating issues &coating on lens started to scratch off... The camera quality suffered as a result.3) 2 months - Vertical lines in the display when first turned on, that would fade away.4) 3 months - Vertical lines became like looking through a mesh, eventually the screen completely failed. It just displays lines and shades.I hope this helps, don't make the same mistake: buy a Samsung S7"
"399108","Sony Xperia Z5 Unlocked Phone - Retail Packaging - White",1,"I've always been a fan of Sony but after this purchase my opinion changed! I just bought it in May 13th and for no reason it stopped working yesterday. It had 50% battery life and out of the blue it just blacked out and I was never able to turn it on again. I am in U.S. for a limited period of time to visit my family and it is so frustrating because all the memories I had with my family in this trip were gone with the phone.I would like to know what Amazon is going to do about it because I am leaving the country in a week and I feel completely deceived."

"399118","Sony Xperia Z5 Unlocked Phone - Retail Packaging - White",4,"Even when this item is sold as ""New"" the box was open and dirty, as when it has been manipulated by several hands, the cell phone plastic cover was from other cell phone because it was shorter and in different shape. When I turned on the cell it started to update some apps, which is normal, and it was trying to update the software version, the cell phone tried several times without success, I had to do it using my computer. Definitely not recommended for people who likes products just ""plug and play"". The cell phone by itself is really good."

"399127","Sony Xperia Z5 Unlocked Phone - Retail Packaging - White",5,"Extremely happy with this phone. It was finally time to upgrade from my Xperia TL, and when I got a chance to try out the Z5 I was more than satisfied. I'm on a family plan with phones including an Iphone 6 and a Samsung Galaxy 7, and I definitely preferred the Z5. Super fast camera with the best image sensor I've seen (also excellent in low light), a super sharp display-even in sunny conditions, super snappy operation and just an overall premium feel. I hope that Sony can get their issues with US carriers sorted out because more people should have access to the excellent Xperia line of phones."
"399128","Sony Xperia Z5 Unlocked Phone - Retail Packaging - White",5,"Love it. Got here quick works flawlessly. No complaints about the phone. Takes a bit to get used to from iPhone and typing/browsing still annoying but everything else superior. Doubt I'll be going back to iPhone."
"399129","Sony Xperia Z5 Unlocked Phone - Retail Packaging - White",1,"I have been a loyal Sony Xperia Z1S and Z3 user and wanted to upgrade to the Z5. Xperia Z5 crashed repeatedly during startup process and then continued to do so with minimal use, even trying to open main menu screens. Factory reset did not fix anything. Returned it within a day and I'll have to wait for the next model to see if they ironed out the kinks."
"399130","Sony Xperia Z5 Unlocked Phone - Retail Packaging - White",5,"Seller 100% recommended. He complied with everything. !!!"
"399131","Sony Xperia Z5 Unlocked Phone - Retail Packaging - White",5,"I felt obligated to leave a feedback because some of the negative and inaccurate reviews users were leaving led me to believe that this phone was not a good buy. I just had the all great and mighty Samsung S7 and I absolutely hated the phone! It ran a bit sluggish, in addition, out of the box the battery was horrible, and I am coming from the Sony Xperia Z3 which I only had to charge once a day. I returned the S7 $800 paperweight that T-Mobile attempted to charge me and decided to purchase the Xperia Z5 since I loved the Z3 so much, but with some of the negative reviews I almost did not purchased the phone. I am so happy that I did not listen to the negative reviews and did it. It has been less than 24hours and this phone is absolutely amazing! I have it running on T-Mobile’s sim card and the service is great, no overheating, in addition I purchased a solid case to keep this amazing phone protected. I think that this is the best phone on the market right now and I wish that people would provide accurate feedback so that others who want to take a chance will also have an amazing experience as I am having. Please, if you are thinking about this phone and already know how solid Sony is, don’t get despair by the negative reviews, take a chance on a brand that you know and get the phone! Life is too short to just settle for anything, treat yourself and live your life!"
"399132","Sony Xperia Z5 Unlocked Phone - Retail Packaging - White",5,"Coming from a Galaxy S3 (with Zerolemon extended battery) that lasted 3+ years, the difference between the two phones is night and day. Definitely larger, less curvy, and thinner. The Z5 feels very premium if not a little on the fragile side. I've heard reports in the past (especially with the Z3) of the screens self-cracking, so I wasn't going to take any chances with this phone. I also ordered a tempered glass screen protector and a clear TPU case and threw those on before anything else.It's only been a few days, and these are my observations thus far:Spent the first two days playing with the Z5 and updating it. An update was available right out of the box. This can be done either through the phone itself or by connecting it to the computer and installing Sony's Xperia Companion software (which I didn't mind.) There were a lot of features to play with. Won't be getting bored any time soon. One thing to note: the volume buttons are on the lower-right side of the phone, as opposed to the Galaxy S3's upper-left side. It takes some getting used to. Some have said that it's simply poor placement, but it's really not that bad. It might be annoying if you're right-handed, but I could see left-handers having an easier time. It's left-hander friendly! And for the record, I could care less about the lack of fingerprint scanner support. I don't think it's a needed feature, and definitely not a deal-breaker. My S3 didn't have one, so I don't believe I'm missing out.Today was my first real day of having it in my pocket while at work. I don't wear tight pants, but the phone is thinner than what I'm used to, so I remained aware of the potential of it bending in my pocket. I charged the phone overnight to 100%. As of this writing (around 4:13 PM), I'm down to 76%. Granted, I wasn't using the camera heavily or playing any games yet or had the screen on for a prolonged period of time. But as it stands, I can easily get two days out of this thing.Here's something of interest: I guess Android 6.0 has a feature called ""Double-tap to Wake"", where you can simply double-tap the display and it'll come on so you can unlock the device from there. Very nice feature! I always think that I'm wearing down the power button with the constant screen turning on and off. BUT, over the course of the work day and having the phone in my pocket, I noticed on two occasions that the flashlight mode was shining in my pocket. Somehow, it enabled itself in my pocket and I know I locked the device. I also noticed that my bluetooth was on, and I had no recollection of turning that on as well. I suspect that the ""Double-tap to Wake"" feature is so sensitive that it's turning on in my pocket, sliding around, and sliding the notification bar down and pressing random settings off and on. Even in my pocket, the screen must be very sensitive! There's apparently a ""Glove mode"" that makes it easier to interact with the screen while wearing gloves. This mode was turned off. I've since turned off the ""Double-tap to Wake"" feature. I'll report back if I'm still having issues with this."

"399134","Sony Xperia Z5 Unlocked Phone - Retail Packaging - White",3,"Phone is good and has good uniformity over other Android phone, but falls short of iPhone uniformity.

I did the MM software update, 6.0. set it up for my needs and have used it since. I have had zero problems, zero overheating. It is much faster & has better battery life than my Samsung.

"399144","Sony Xperia Z5 Unlocked Phone - Retail Packaging - White",3,"Very good phone everything is very quick and easy to use and I have had no problems so far.Edit: After a long time of use I began to notice that if you use 4k or full hd 60fps recording the phone gets extremely hot and overheats. Actually no its not just those two even if you open or use an app for a long time it overheats and this is a problem i've noticed in all xperia phones which is disappoint considering I absolutely love everything else about them. If this issue is fixed then this phone would be perfect but other than that nothing else has gave me problems."
"399145","Sony Xperia Z5 Unlocked Phone - Retail Packaging - White",2,"Coming from a Z3, I had very very high expectations, but due to the recent development of a flickering display issue, I decided to give the Z5 a chance.Within 3 hours of arrival, and fresh off a system update, the phone was shutting down the camera app due to thermal issues, and I was getting notifications about temperature problems. Whether I was taking 8mp images or 60fps full hd, same problem. If a phone's primary advertising feature is its camera's capabilities, those features should work.The display has a very odd tint to it, making whites appear red/purple, and giving other colors a weird cast, regardless of the xreality settings...maybe they put too much red in their Triluminos display technology...Adjusting the color calibration brings it closer to white, but gives things a greyish cast as well.While attempting to charge the phone using the supplied adapter, it was discharging faster than it could charge...all I was doing was downloading apps through google play, and had the screen on.Maybe I just got a dud, but Sony support killed it for me when their only solution was to check the return policy of the store from which I purchased, and then get sarcastic with me when I asked if that's all they were able to suggest.If this were priced as a midrange phone, I'd be more lenient, but at more than half a grand this is just unacceptable.Given that Sony has shuddered direct US sales of this phone, and their support is all overseas, I think I'm done with Sony Mobile. Too bad, too, cause the Z3 really was incredible."

"399154","Sony Xperia ZL C6502 Unlocked Android Phone--U.S. Warranty (Black)",5,"It's a very good phone. I totally satisfied with its performance.Recommended for others people about this phone.BRs,Thoang"
"399155","Sony Xperia ZL C6502 Unlocked Android Phone--U.S. Warranty (Black)",4,"Overall a great phone. While some may be put off by the aging software, Sony's tight user experience makes up for it in my mind. The hardware, while not the best available anymore, is still certainly top of the line and more than adequate for anything you might throw at it. The build quality is fantastic and the audio output sound quality in comparison to my old HTC One X is phenomenal(that phone did not sound good at all and had some awful white noise that was always present when listening to music).The only reason I didn't give this phone a full five stars is because of the screen, but I don't have a problem with the viewing angles as some people do. My problem is that it appears easier to scratch then the other smart phones I've seen recently and appears to scratch easier then my old HTC did. The camera is also fairly good and I think it has more accurate color portrayal them some other phones do(no fake over saturation). The Sony Xperia skin on top of android is very light as well and if you mix it with a launcher app it is very pleasant. The included music playing application works perfectly and it very easy to use. Far better than the experiences I've had with other companies included software.If you want a good quality phone that is a little more unique then some and aren't after the very latest in hardware/software I feel like this is a good solid, reliable, choice."

"399157","Sony Xperia ZL C6502 Unlocked Android Phone--U.S. Warranty (Black)",5,"A 5 inch incredible display in a small footprint plus so many great features that really add up to make this a fantastic smartphone. My last phone was the Nexus 4 and although it is very fast and worked well in general, the really average to bad camera got me to start looking into phones that come with good cameras. I read a lot of reviews and did a ton of research and ended up deciding on the ZL. Glad I did. The camera is really a huge improvement and colors jump out with great resolution plus the camera software is point and shoot caliber, I am very happy with the camera. Beyond that I didn't expect much but the screen is sooo much better than the Nexus 4 it is shocking! Esp for videos with the Bravia 2 engine built in, it really is amazing and has to be seen. On top of that the FM radio is a nice plus and the IR Blaster is interesting as it actually works with my non Sony TV. Bonus. The inclusion of the SD card is another huge plus, already it has really come in handy. In conclusion I truly never though I would end up with a Sony phone but am so happy with this purchase. It looks and feels really high end with a lot of little touches that add up..."

"399168","Sony Xperia ZL C6502 Unlocked Android Phone--U.S. Warranty (Black)",4,"A great phone overall but it's kind of hard to get used to the front facing camera. Beautiful display and feels great in the hand."
"399169","Sony Xperia ZL C6502 Unlocked Android Phone--U.S. Warranty (Black)",1,"Recieved the brand new phone only to find out the hard way that no micro sim inserted into the sim card slot works at all. I Get the message No Sim Card-Emergency calls only. My service provider tried every micro sim they had and none worked. I even tried my sisters micro sim.AV House is the seller by the way. Please do not buy anything from these people."

The black n rough back cover is really cool which I really like n it has such a great display, am giving it a 4 star because it's media volume seems a little too low without earphones"
"399171","Sony Xperia ZL C6502 Unlocked Android Phone--U.S. Warranty (Black)",5,"The reason i bought this phone was do to its uniqueness. FIRST THING THIS PHONE HAS NO BLOATWARE. It works with t-mobile, at&t and other prepaid just make sure you have the right sim(band) frequency. It has an amazing 13mp back camera and a decent front camera,(It does not lag like other phone when recording or shooting pictures). I thought it was lte but i chose the wrong model its not a big deal since i have wifi everywhere. For me the battery lasts me about 7-9 hours a day regular usage. I cant complain about the brightness in day light for me its fine for other its the end of the world. Also the phone is very easy to use"
"399172","Sony Xperia ZL C6502 Unlocked Android Phone--U.S. Warranty (Black)",3,"this is more of a question than a review, i bought this phone last November, we are now in March 2014, i have started to get a freezing problem on this phone and was wondering if anyone else has been experiencing it as well, the phone has not gotten wet or fell, and i only have regular social media apps installed on it, jellybean 4.3 update has been sent out but i have not gotten that update yet in my country, i am just bombed out by the fact this phone freezes on me, performing simple tasks such as answering calls, or even opening the album to view photos, the only way to unfreeze the phone is to open the flap in the back to press the ""off"" button, yes ive tried PC companion, yes ive tried sony's support forum/customerservice/support center, all to no reconcile, this phone should not be freezing like this, its a quad core phone, anyone has any ideas or possible resolve? the phone freezes randomly one day it will be fine, and then another, it will just freeze just like that (getting a lil hot) it's really frustrating, i actually still like the phone, at 3 stars, any advice or tips would be appreciated,"

"399175","Sony Xperia ZL C6502 Unlocked Android Phone--U.S. Warranty (Black)",4,"I chose to give 4 because the person whom I gifted this item to, was very happy with it. First hand I noticed the screen is really high resolution, which is what you would expect when you cram 1080p on a mobile phone screen. UI felt smooth to the touch. Games I played were smooth and I really enjoyed playing them on this screen. Latest android OS seems solid. Overall, satisfied with the product. Glad that my gift was turned out to be a good one."
"399176","Sony Xperia ZL C6502 Unlocked Android Phone--U.S. Warranty (Black)",5,"I really had a high spectative about this phone, the screen is so bright (i used a medium level for battery life), the transicions are so smooth, the launcher that i use (Nova) run perfectly, HD widgets no problems, the camera is perfect, the sound is clear and loud, well the five star is quiet enough for me, if i found some ""issue"" is the weight (i came from own a ARC S). But its taste matter."

"399179","Sony Xperia ZL C6502 Unlocked Android Phone--U.S. Warranty (Black)",5,"I absolutely love my Xperia ZL, it might not be as ""top dog"" as a GS4 but its competitiveness is certainly close behind and for a price that you definitely cant complain with as the device hold so much feature for a little above average user. The only real issue i find with the device is the battery power which i really think should be improved and i don't know if its just me but sometimes whenever the device is charging the touch seem a bit slow at responsiveness and getting to the camera app from the lock screen or even on an unlocked screen by long pressing the dedicated button is a bit slow but none-the-less it gets you there but other than those two obvious flaws i found so far it is absolutely fantastic and i love it, was definitely not a disappointment. I would recommend getting the Xperia Z or ZL without hesitating if your on a $500 budget and want something great and unlocked but cant find that extra $150 USD to reach for a GS4 or HTC One because you'll love it unless you're just downright biased at performance."
"399180","Sony Xperia ZL C6502 Unlocked Android Phone--U.S. Warranty (Black)",1,"Phone freezes up a lot. Regret the purchase and I only use this phone just for phone calls. The camera says its a 13 mb but performs like a 6mb"
"399181","Sony Xperia ZL C6502 Unlocked Android Phone--U.S. Warranty (Black)",4,"Base on some commends on the web, sounded like this one would work with T-Mobile's LTE. Well I give it a shot. So far, I have tried to enable different radio software and all I got is HSPA+. But the HSPA+ is faster than my Galaxy Nexus. Good news is, this phone works with my $5.00 Tzone plan. Will T-mobile stop it in a few days.... time will tell.The speaker is loud, but not clear like the HTC one. I like the screen size and it's very stylish. For $50 more, I would get the C6506 with LTE instead."
"399182","Sony Xperia ZL C6502 Unlocked Android Phone--U.S. Warranty (Black)",5,"Over the last few years I've used several devices ranging from the OG Droid, Droid 2, and the Samsung Galaxy Nexus. I was on the market to purchase a new phone because I was looking for cheaper service and all of my phones were on Verizon's network. I've always been a Sony fanboy, and I already own their Tablet S, PSP, PS3, and Vaio. The Xperia ZL Allowed for seamless integration between them all, and shares data and media between them easily. The phone is comfortable to hold and doesn't feel too light or heavy. I opted for the ZL over the Z because i wanted the physical camera button, and I wasn't a huge fan of all the flaps that Sony had used on the Z to make it waterproof. The Camera quality is amazing and all of the filters and add-ons have been fun to use. Sony adds a slight skin on top of Jelly Bean 4.2, but only so that icons and transitions have been a little stylized, making it an easy transition from my Nexus device. I ditched my data plan with Verizon, and am using a call & txt plan with Red Pocket Mobile. I'm reliant on wi-fi for data, but surprisingly it hasn't been a problem. I would definitely recommend this phone to others who love a pretty screen, a good camera(13mp), and value a quality build."
"399183","Sony Xperia ZL C6502 Unlocked Android Phone--U.S. Warranty (Black)",5,"Battery is pretty decent in stamina mode. Wish I could customize the notification light though.

"399186","Sony Xperia ZL C6502 Unlocked Android Phone--U.S. Warranty (Black)",5,"The phone is fast with no hickups, looks great, the screen is very sharp, it's small for its screen size, and battery life is much better than I expected for a 5"" phone. Stamina mode makes a big difference. Despite playing games and browsing websites, it's not unusual for me to have 45% battery left after a 16 hour day. I haven't been able to upgrade to android 4.3 using Sony bridge, but since 4.4 will be released within a month I will wait until then to revisit this issue so see whether it's a problematic fix or I'm just doing something wrong. I would highly recommend this phone."

"399191","Sony Xperia ZL C6502 Unlocked Android Phone--U.S. Warranty (Black)",4,"This is my first Android phone after switching from an Iphone 4. I was able to pick up how to use it really easily and over all I prefer it. This phone is easy to use and its very powerful. The built in memory is plenty for Apps and there is an easy port to add an SD Card. switching the phone to my carrier was simple too, all It took was to slip in the sim card (this applies for AT&T) as it was the same size as the one for the Iphone. the Xperia support program that you can install to the PC took a bit of work, as long as you go to Computer and install from the phone not the site you should be fine. Get a screen protector, the screen is very large so there is alot of potential for scratches. The only major complaint that I have is that there is no Physical Home button but there is a portion of the screen that serves as the home button. also the power button is on the right side so that could take some adjustment. I have not tested its ability to function in water so dont ask"

"399208","Sony Xperia ZL LTE C6506 Unlocked Android Phone - US Warranty - (Black)",5,"The Sony Xperia ZL, a sibling of the much hyped Sony Xperia Z in the rest of the world, it's a great Android smartphone. Size wise it is similar to the earlier generation Xperia Ion so it is amazing engineers at Sony are able to pack a massive 5 inch screen into the tiny body. Though perhaps because of the sheer size of the screen, the front facing camera is placed at an awkward position which makes any kind of video calls funky.Feature wise this phone can give the Galaxy S4 a run for its money.Sony has been making great phones since separated from the failed joint venture with Ericsson. Unfortunately, the marketing arm doesn't seem to know a thing or two about the US mobile market. This phone is priced competitively with other ""unlocked"" devices like iPhone and Galaxy S4, but in the US there is almost no meaningful market for ""unlocked"" devices. US consumers are so accustomed to device pricing with network subsidies from 2-year contracts they will scream at $500+ price tags for smartphones even though that is how much these phones are priced outside the US."
"399209","Sony Xperia ZL LTE C6506 Unlocked Android Phone - US Warranty - (Black)",5,"I was looking for a phone that would work equally well on ATT and T Mobil networks. This one fits the bill and will function on both the ATT lte network and T Moblil's new lte network. Overall, this phone performs very well. While a longer battery life would be nice, it does a very good job of managing what it has and I can generally count on 2 full days between charges.The IPS screen is sharp and bright. Video playback is smooth. NFC provided some surprising benefits in managing the phones configuration as well as file transfers etc. Given the breadth of function this phone is a good value."

"399212","Sony Xperia ZL LTE C6506 Unlocked Android Phone - US Warranty - (Black)",5,"Technologist and early adopter here (sort of). Sony has made a great product with the Xperia ZL. I did my research and upgraded from a 2yr old Samsung Galaxy S2 which was starting to freeze and just being a complete inconvenience. The Xperia ZL is a gorgeous phone with lots of very cool features (check out the tech specs from any reputable site). Battery life is good (with the Stamina mode), doesn't feel cheap or commonplace to hold, and not a whole lot of bloatware to whine about. Love it!"

"399216","Sony Xperia ZL LTE C6506 Unlocked Android Phone - US Warranty - (Black)",5,"This is perhaps the best phone I've yet had when you consider it's feature-set and design both independently and compared to it's contemporary peers.Between the small bezel and frame housing a 5"" screen, the extensive LTE support and usual high-end specs -- 1.5GHz snapdragon, 2GB memory, 12MPixel camera, 2370mAh battery -- it's an impressive piece of hardware. The industrial design is just sexy, in my opinion. I do wish it had the waterproofing of the Z or ZR, but this is a worthy trade-off in my mind for it's smaller size, especially considering my usage.I've heard a few complaints that it shipped with the Snapdragon APQ8064 processor clocked @ 1.5 and while I'll take any processor improvement I can get (Snapdragon 800 would be great), so far the UI is smooth and 1080p x264/AVC videos run well. Frankly, these phones summed over a normal usage pattern spend most of their times down-clocked, so the extra head room is only seen in edge-cases. And in the long-term, as Android advances it seems to be most sensitive to memory capacity, which all these phones have 2GB of.So, I very much like this phone. In hardware terms it's fantastic. I have no complaints and as long as Sony keeps up the quick work in porting over new Android revisions, I'll be happy."
"399217","Sony Xperia ZL LTE C6506 Unlocked Android Phone - US Warranty - (Black)",5,"By far the best smartphone I've ever had. Or used. Its not that any one feature stands out, but everything is high quality and works flawlessly. The only thing better might be the xperia z, but for those of us who don't use tmobile that doesn't help much. Other phones might have one feature with better specs, but you lose nothing overall with this one. Great video and picture quality. The viewing angle problem reported by others is greatly exaggerated. It depends more on the quality of the media being viewed."

"399221","Sony Xperia ZL LTE C6506 Unlocked Android Phone - US Warranty - (Black)",5,"This is a great phone. I had upgraded from the Xperia TL and this phone screen is bigger and in my opinion runs faster and smoother. The phone is presently running on Kit Kat. Only small issue is that it came with the language set on Spanish out of the box."
"399222","Sony Xperia ZL LTE C6506 Unlocked Android Phone - US Warranty - (Black)",4,"Good phone, not the fastest Xperia.Support many frequency bands.Not water resistant."
"399223","Sony Xperia ZL LTE C6506 Unlocked Android Phone - US Warranty - (Black)",1,"Pros:- Top quality graphics and resolution, with great viewing angle- Fast processor- Good quality sound- Small footprint considering size of monitor- Good battery life when using power management toolsCons:- For an unlocked, non-carrier, full-price phone, Sony did not have any problems loading this thing up with useless bloatware- Inefficient use of processor, much slower than phones with a fraction of the processing power- Screen protector (shatter guard), not a scratch protector. No mention of this on Sony's documentation or website, even the retail outlets who sell this phone identify this as a scratch protector, which is already bonded to the screen. It's anything but. This pre-bonded ""screen protector"" is very, very soft and designed to prevent breaking or shattering of the screen if dropped, but will pick up scratches and get cloudy very easy if an aftermarket scratch cover is not placed on top of it. This would be good to know from the documentation, and in advance. Once it's all scratched up, there is not much that can be done without voiding the warranty. If peeled off, the Sony logo comes off with it, and the warranty is void. Moreover, Sony does not sell a replacement for this. You're stuck with an ugly cloudy, scratched up screen, or a phone with no warranty- The phone worked okay out of the box, but consistently got worse after multiple firmware updates. Some issues include: Randomly powering on/off every 10 minutes (until fixed with yet another firmware update), consistent locked screens, screen jitter, loss of touch and hardware buttons. Sometimes this phone locks up and cannot be re-booted because both the power button and touch screen become disabled. The Solution, wait for the battery to die to reboot (cannot remove the battery), or use Sony's PC companion to recover and lose all data. During a lock up, data cannot even be backed up using the USB or PC Companion software. I keep it backed up when it's working properly, and keep my phone numbers on the external SD card, because I've had to wipe it and re-install the OS so many times. I can't wait 2 or 3 days for the battery to die to use my phoneUPDATE: I downgraded this to a 1-star because it continues to be a HUGE disappoint. It randomly overheats and can burn through a full charge in 20 minutes or less. It continues to randomly reboot. Sometimes it will not recharge, just starts beeping and going in and out of recharge mode. After the last Sony (forced) software upgrade, all the settings were again set to default, with more bloatware, and more problems. It also won't keep my preferences. For example, if I change the clock style on the main screen, the next day it re-sets to another style. This phone is an absolute nightmare!"

"399227","Sony Xperia ZL LTE C6506 Unlocked Android Phone - US Warranty - (Black)",2,"Bought this for a friend who I had given a phone I wanted back but never sent this one to her. After it sat for a few weeks I decided to give it a test run. Connectivity is fine and while the scratch mentioned in the add is there I already knew about Sony's beautiful screens. The problems began when I made my first call. The person could not hear me. So I hung up and tried again,same. Called another person, same result switched over to speaker phone to complete the call. So obviously the microphone is not working correctly. Now after about 6 days of use for web browsing the phone no longer recognizes all power cords/usb had to try multiple before finding one that it would respond too. Needless to say happy I procrastinated in sending this phone to someone else."
"399228","Sony Xperia ZL LTE C6506 Unlocked Android Phone - US Warranty - (Black)",4,"The phone looks great, it works well, and the infrared port that allows it to be used as a remote control for so many devices is priceless. That being said, the speaker volume is very weak. I tried watching sports live, and it was difficult to hear anything if there were people nearby engaged in normal conversation. All of that I had read about in other reviews, so I am not surprised.What has surprised me very negatively, to the point that I almost give the phone a 3-star rating, is the ""Gesture typing"". What Sony calls their version of Swype. I have used Swype in a smaller screen (an LG myTouch) and a much larger screen (Kindle Fire HDX 8.9"") for about two years, and BOTH are superior simply because they do not pretend to know more than you know about what you are typing.It annoys the hell out of me how it displays the word that you actually mean to type, and the instant you lift your finger it changes it to something else, absolutely different, for reasons totally unknown to me. For instance, I try to Swype ""Delaware"", and this thing simply comes up with ""Eyewear"", or ""Eldar"", or ""Else"" or a number of other words. Had I read about this I would NOT have bought this phone."

It has everything you can wish for a smartphone but the hardware has serious issues. The unit I receive keeps on getting unresponsive from sleep mode after about 20 to 30 minutes of sleep. Pressing the power button will not wake it up. Suggestions regarding pressing the Vol+ and Power button didn't help. It seems like it just crashed while in sleep mode so the only recourse is open the back panel which holds the SIM and Sd card and press the Reset button for several seconds till it vibrates and restarts. I've tried upgrading the firmware to different versions (4.2.2, 4.3, 4.4) to no avail. I ended up returning it after two days of battling the issue. The placement of the protruding power button on the side is also a very bad placement if you are using a holster case as the side of any holster case will tend to press the Power button."
"399232","Sony Xperia ZL LTE C6506 Unlocked Android Phone - US Warranty - (Black)",2,"One day before the end of the return period this phone stopped charging and I had to return it. Thank goodness it was within the return window, because looking through the reviews here it seems that I definitely didn't want to have to deal with Sony customer service.What I do worry about? I couldn't delete all my private info off the phone because, as I mentioned, it stopped working. Argh.As for the phone before its unexpected and early demise? It was fine. I liked the Walkman sound. I liked the quality manufacturing feel. It was, however, too heavy. I first started regretting my purchase when I was out with a friend and we decided to view movie previews. My phone would not play the video without stopping to load. Her iphone, sitting right next to me, played the movie without hesitation. I thought it was likely the Family Mobile network (I think she was using Verizon), and it might have been, but after a month of using the phone I think it was probably also the phone itself. Other reviews have commented that it isn't good for watching video.I ended up buying a Moto X. I also found out about Republic Wireless, so I'll be saving money on my monthly bill too (note that you can't use an unlocked GSM phone purchased here on Amazon with that network - it's CDMA and the phones they sell are modified for their service). The Moto X cost me $100 less than the Xperia ZL, and it totally blows the Xperia out of the water as far as I'm concerned. It's lightweight and lightening fast with all sorts of amazing features (my favorite: you can talk to the phone without unlocking it and it will do what you say, so you don't need to have it in your hands to make a call or listen to music or whatever). I'm actually GLAD my Xperia died so I had the opportunity to buy a phone that I love. I also thank Amazon for their reasonable and responsive return policy."

"399247","Sony Xperia ZL LTE C6506 Unlocked Android Phone - US Warranty - (Black)",1,"Claimed to be new, but it's an open box item, even worse, can't power onwaste of time"
"399248","Sony Xperia ZL LTE C6506 Unlocked Android Phone - US Warranty - (Black)",5,"This is one of the best phones I've had. Thin, fast, excellent camera, large screen. Though the screen is large it is the same size as the Lumia 920 I owned. The battery life is short, on heavy use only last 4 hours, on average use can last almost all day. It comes with a Sony back up feature that backs up an ""image"" of the phone into the microSD card. The PC interface is also very useful.I wish the headphone set that comes with it would be of better quality. The front facing camera placement is odd."
"399249","Sony Xperia ZL LTE C6506 Unlocked Android Phone - US Warranty - (Black)",5,"I was afraid that the red color might be too bright- it isn't. It has a dull anodized aluminum look and the shade of red is just right. The phone looks great and I am glad I didn't go for the tepid white or the faceless but neutral black (black even costs a lot more on amazon, for some reason).It updated as soon as I got it to 4.1.2 with some fixes and late June, another update took it to 4.2.2. The phone has radio capable of HSPA+ and LTE on almost all network operators in the USA, at least. The battery life is average for the phone on usage; the standby life is pretty good. The screen is gorgeous. The Sony customization is minimal and I like the themes it ships with. It has nice walkman, album and video ( and reader) apps. Call and sound Q are good. You can receive calls without unlocking.The phone is worth the money. I had considered HTC one (google play) edition for its hardware/build quality but it does not have 1700 Mhz support for HSPA. The samsung S4 (google play) costs $100 more and offers nothing for it.I hope Sony will keep updates coming at the same regularity."
"399250","Sony Xperia ZL LTE C6506 Unlocked Android Phone - US Warranty - (Black)",4,"This product,I have to return, so far my instinct works...when in doubt about a certain item, return for it will just become a headche in the end."
"399251","Sony Xperia ZL LTE C6506 Unlocked Android Phone - US Warranty - (Black)",5,"I just love Sony phones. This my 3rd Sony phone. Earlier I was using xperia ray and it was too a sneak peace developed by Sony. But with 5' display, 1080p and stunning Camera I couldn't resist to buy xperia Z. Initially I thought to buy Xperia Z but due to lack of 4G LTE support in US I decided to go with Xperia ZL. But now I don't feel any regret.Only one concern is about battery life. Sony could have done better. Nevertheless on new power management app you can rely on."
"399252","Sony Xperia ZL LTE C6506 Unlocked Android Phone - US Warranty - (Black)",5,"I used Xperia Ray then went to iPhone4 after that choose Galaxy SIII then change operating system bought Nokia Lumia 920. Everything was right except lacking of applications in WP system I came back to Android and was waiting for something Stylist and has good features. Finally I found Sony Xperia Zl and the best part of it I can use any network.I'm now using SIMPLE MOBILE and it's wroking great.So far no problem. Love the phone."
"399253","Sony Xperia ZL LTE C6506 Unlocked Android Phone - US Warranty - (Black)",4,"I love the phone, but I am not blown away by it. The complaints about the screen angles are overblown, it looks just fine - yes you will experience wash outs frequently, but really you're usually looking straight at the phone anyway.The phone feels solid as a rock, unlike my old beloved SGS2. It's also a fair bit heavier, but overall does not feel heavyThere is noticeable jitter and lag occasionally. However on the whole the phone flies through tasks, you won't think to yourself ""ah man, slow phone"".People pan the battery life, but I find it quite good. It's easy to get over a day of power out of it with medium usageI had it not even two weeks and already had a nasty drop. The front and back look great, but surprisingly the metal edges dent and scratch very easily, so I recommend some kind of protective case, even a minimal one. Sadly mine still hasn't arrived yet... dang.The white looks damn classy in person. Finger-on-screen feel is better than any other phone I've ownedSide note:Be ready to frog-march AT&T through your LTE activation process. This isn't anything to do with the phone obviously, but I spent a good 5+ hours with their support before they pulled their heads out of their butt and activated LTE properly. Be clear and be persistent if you are on AT&T and buying this phone."
"399254","Sony Xperia ZL LTE C6506 Unlocked Android Phone - US Warranty - (Black)",5,"I found it to be a great phone, great screen, great performance, excellent camera (in good light conditions), Sony additions to Android don't bother or even are good, solid construction... to summarize, I really recommend this phone.The only bad thing is that the screen has some small scratches by just putting it into my pocket, by itself, with nothing else in the same that you could say caused them."
"399255","Sony Xperia ZL LTE C6506 Unlocked Android Phone - US Warranty - (Black)",5,"There are better reviews than I could do written elsewhere, just wanted to comment a little.I have it rooted and the bootloader unlocked, running PACMan ROM(CM10.1 based) perfectly fine.If you have decent headphones the output on this tends to be a little quiet.It comes with a screen protector pre-installed. (but it still scratches easy, I ended up buying another one and plopping it on top)Once again, it's red. When I ordered this I didn't realize until a couple days later when I was looking at the order that it was, in fact, red and not black as I thought.I wasn't attached to it being black so it still looks good.Battery will last about 5 hours of non-stop video watching, or 20+ hours(I haven't gone past that yet) if you're not really using your phone much for anything(like maybe 30-60 minutes of sporadic screen usage for messaging or something in the whole day at minimum brightness)I don't see what the big fuss about viewing angles is, it doesn't render it unreadable or anything... It's not even bothersome if I'm watching a video.T-Mobile just started rolling out LTE in Los Angeles so I've been picking that up around town, I'm able to reach speeds of almost 30/10 in some areas.Overall, coming from a Samsung Exhibit II 4G aka Galaxy Exhibit 4G, I'm fairly happy with this purchase.08/14/13 Update: Still going strong, running Illusion ROM now. Also wanted to comment that if you want to use this phone on T-Mobile it's as simple as ordering a mini-SIM card from them and putting it in.(Obviously you need service too) If you already have a T-Mobile SIM card then you can take it to any T-Mobile store and they will resize it for you, otherwise it costs about $20 to get a replacement SIM.11/13/13 Update: Everything's good in Sonyland, I'm now running Omni ROM which has great performance so far, I've combined it with Xposed Framework + Modules to get back the features that are missing from other ROMs, everything works great. Battery life is pretty decent so far, depends on how much I use the screen and whether I'm on mobile data or not. If I'm at home all day on Wifi and not using my phone much besides listening to some stuff now and then and some socializing, I'm at 46% after 14 hours.Now, in the real world, when I'm working and out and about, I tend to get about 8-10 hours before I hit the 20% mark, but personally I use my phone a lot when I'm working for various things, Wifi hotspot and Wifi analyzer are probably the most draining, along with using the screen more simply to look stuff up. Some people might fare better, but even still in an age where you can find an outlet anywhere, and car chargers are fairly cheap, I don't really see any reason to be worried about the battery, unless you plan on watching videos all day, in which case you can expect the same 5 hour battery life as the Galaxy S4.Myself, I carry a 12000mAH(claimed) backup battery when I need to charge while working around since I don't like leaving my phone to sit by an outlet(plus it looks a little janky), but the only times I've truly needed this are during a convention where there was poor mobile data reception and wifi was outrageously priced, thus forcing my phone to work probably twice as hard to maintain a decent connection, thus draining the battery faster than normal.Also, I have to exclaim about the build quality on this phone as it seems to be really quite solid, due to various mishaps my phone has fallen a couple of times onto concrete from probably 3-4 feet with just some minor cosmetic damage mostly on the bottom left corner, what was really surprising was the second time I dropped it, now keep in mind I have a Skinomi screen protector which has kind of a soft springy feel to it, the second time I dropped it the phone had landed flat on it's face, when I picked it up I was amazed to see not a single scratch of damage. My running theory is that the screen protector absorbed most of the shock, but even still, whatever Sony did with this phone seems to be alright.So far though, my biggest gripe is whatever amp they used on the phone is simply not powerful enough. For the earpiece it seems to be more than adequate, but I often find myself wishing to be able to raise the volume past maximum during a call on speakerphone, and the headphone out is just simply not powerful enough for most headphones.Now, after almost half a year, would I recommend this phone to people? Maybe. If you want more accessories or stronger developer support, the Nexus 5 is a fine choice along with the Galaxy S4 and LG G2. If you want a great phone that compliments class and is different compared to most people, I would strongly suggest the ZL. If you want a phone that's waterproof, you should probably be looking at the Xperia Z or Z1 not the ZL.In the end it comes down to preference, You have the Nexus 5 which is quite nice albeit lacking any sort of excitement and a microSD slot, the Galaxy S4 which is more expensive and everybody and their mothers have one(though the replaceable battery is quite nice), the LG G2 which is pretty much the Nexus 5 but with a bigger battery and with LG's software mods, then you have the Xperia Z1 which is just a second generation Z, and finally the HTC One which not only is similar in price to the S4 but it also lacks a microSD slot.And then the ZL itself, expensive yes, but not too expensive, different from the majority in design, yet similar in performance(for the most part), if anything, the ZL is a jack of all trades, master of none, managing to exceed at not exceeding, which sounds kind of dumb but if you have the phone it kind of makes sense, it's simply a good phone, nothing more, nothing less.Honestly the most surprising part of this phone is that the battery isn't removeable, considering the Xperia ZR, which is also waterproof mind you, does include this feature.Here's hoping to a new ZL for 2014 that can truly set a name for itself.04/28/14 Update: New builds of 4.4 ROMs for this phone have been pretty damn good at managing battery life, I usually expect my phone to last at least 8-12 hours during a normal workday, though I think my record so far is 35 hours, which was staying home for 2 days and using my phone only for some podcast listening.Performance feels smoother with newer ROMs, hoping to better battery and performance once the Sony official 4.4 ROM is out.I've gone through various screen protectors at this point, mostly to experiment, I still think Skinomi is the best at actually protecting your screen but it can sometimes make the screen look a little funny.A little bit of the paint on the back has scratched off but I think that's from the fall it took before, I just never noticed.Everything else on the phone is still in perfect, functioning order."
"399256","Sony Xperia ZL LTE C6506 Unlocked Android Phone - US Warranty - (Black)",4,"Bought this phone over the Galaxy S4 because of its being a true international 4G phone and its FM radio, which the galaxy does not have. The worst thing about this phone is it camera, absolutely lame images, my old 8MP C905 produces better images than this. It does get a bit warm especially when surfing the net. Other than that this is an awesome phone, the viewing angles are not as bad as most reviews make them out to be, the colours just get washed out a bit. Its fast and snappy, just a bit of stutter at times I find, but this can be fixed with an update. If you want a true international phone this is it."

"399261","Sony Xperia ZL LTE C6506 Unlocked Android Phone - US Warranty - (Black)",2,"I got two of these back in 2013. Looked great. Got compliments everywhere I went but then it started getting several random issues. It suddenly stopped charging while I was in the carribean for vacation. Amazon was kind enough to let me exchange. The new one ended up having the same issue in a couple weeks. Sony advised me to only use their charger adapter and cable which is ridiculous. I consider myself tech savvy and I managed to use android sdk and reset the phone via my l laptop. Since then I have only used Sony charger without charging issues but the phone has numerous other issues. I still use one of the phones as my secondary phone. After the latest updates, most of the issues I had got resolved but created other new issues. I would never ever buy a Sony phone again. Looks very classy though, build quality is great. Dropped the phone few times, not a scratch on the screen. The sides started peeling off after 2 years but I wouldn't complain as 2 yrs is a long time for cell phone. The software and hardware bugs makes this phone a 2 star instead of the 5 star it could otherwise earned."

"399271","Sony Xperia ZL LTE C6506 Unlocked Android Phone - US Warranty - (Black)",1,"The phone didn't work properly straight from the package. It was obvious that this device wasn't tested since it was refurbished and you would think that would be taken care of prior.

"399272","Sony Xperia ZL LTE C6506 Unlocked Android Phone - US Warranty - (Black)",1,"The Xperia ZL is a great piece of technology. Fast processor, excellent HD screen, reasonable battery life.Alas, for reasons unclear to me at present, the phone died within 60 days of purchase.When I say ""died"", please allow me to be more specific. I'm fairly tech-savvy, and do not remotely give up at the first sign of trouble. Alas, this phone beat me.Seemingly at random one afternoon, the phone's touch-screen stopped responding to input. So...that pretty much means the phone is, for all intents and purposes...dead. I attempted the following basic solutions:1) Factory Reset2) ""Repair"" option on the Sony Bridge / desktop app3) Reinstall OS / Flash OSUnfortunately, none of these worked. The phone, even after reinstalling the drivers and firmware, continue to be unresponsive on the touch-screen.I spoke to Sony's warranty department. And unfortunately, since I'm in Europe at the moment where the specific LTE model is not sold...I'm basically out of luck. No suggestions from Sony, other than to ship it back to a regional repair site in North America.So in the end...I spend a good $600 or so...on a phone that functioned...for about 60 days.Unfortunately, Sony's entire Z-line of products seems to be plagues with several ""instant death"" problems. Unfortunately what I experienced is not uncommon. Just dig around google a bit; you'll see.So...if you'd like to pay $10/day for a phone on average...that will become a brick within 60 days...well, look no further."
"399273","Sony Xperia ZL LTE C6506 Unlocked Android Phone - US Warranty - (Black)",5,"This phone works like a charm! Sony out did themselves with this one!

"399275","Sony Xperia ZL LTE C6506 Unlocked Android Phone - US Warranty - (Black)",2,"This is my first Android phone and it's not a bad phone but the battery life is very poor. It would not last a whole day if I were to use continuously, especially watching movies."
"399276","Sony Xperia ZL LTE C6506 Unlocked Android Phone - US Warranty - (Black)",5,"Fantastic Smartphone, has almost everything I need, and the only I'm missing is something most people wouldn't -and that is a dual-SIM option. I've had the C6502 version before with the alledged installed pressure sensor (as per SONY's own white papers!!) it wasn't, though. SONY, in the meantime took it out of the white papers.The one this review refers to, however, is the C6506, which is the one with LTE instead of the pressure sensor. It is really a great phone hardwarewise. SONY have the ""companion"" software in place which helps you to stay up to date with your phone along with some other services. The transfer software didn't work, so I started installing from scratch which I didn't expect. But then again, this is software which you wouldn't need all the time anyway and therefore shouldn't diminish the value of this great hardware.This phone is one of the few smartphones that has the T-Mobile 3G AWS (1700) band on board. It truly is a phone that you can use with most of its features worldwide!If I have anything that could be improved then it is the phone reception. My HTC Incredible S which I had before, has better reception. About everything else onboard my new SONY Xperia ZL (C6506) is so much better, and it still has a valuable SD card slot on board, which the NEXUS does not have -a political Google decision as they want you to use their online storage.I highly recommend this smartphone. It soon is slotted to obtain the latest Android (Kitkat)."

"399278","Sony Xperia ZL LTE C6506 Unlocked Android Phone - US Warranty - (Red)",5,"The Sony Xperia ZL, a sibling of the much hyped Sony Xperia Z in the rest of the world, it's a great Android smartphone. Size wise it is similar to the earlier generation Xperia Ion so it is amazing engineers at Sony are able to pack a massive 5 inch screen into the tiny body. Though perhaps because of the sheer size of the screen, the front facing camera is placed at an awkward position which makes any kind of video calls funky.Feature wise this phone can give the Galaxy S4 a run for its money.Sony has been making great phones since separated from the failed joint venture with Ericsson. Unfortunately, the marketing arm doesn't seem to know a thing or two about the US mobile market. This phone is priced competitively with other ""unlocked"" devices like iPhone and Galaxy S4, but in the US there is almost no meaningful market for ""unlocked"" devices. US consumers are so accustomed to device pricing with network subsidies from 2-year contracts they will scream at $500+ price tags for smartphones even though that is how much these phones are priced outside the US."
"399279","Sony Xperia ZL LTE C6506 Unlocked Android Phone - US Warranty - (Red)",5,"I was looking for a phone that would work equally well on ATT and T Mobil networks. This one fits the bill and will function on both the ATT lte network and T Moblil's new lte network. Overall, this phone performs very well. While a longer battery life would be nice, it does a very good job of managing what it has and I can generally count on 2 full days between charges.The IPS screen is sharp and bright. Video playback is smooth. NFC provided some surprising benefits in managing the phones configuration as well as file transfers etc. Given the breadth of function this phone is a good value."

I did my research and upgraded from a 2yr old Samsung Galaxy S2 which was starting to freeze and just being a complete inconvenience. The Xperia ZL is a gorgeous phone with lots of very cool features (check out the tech specs from any reputable site). Battery life is good (with the Stamina mode), doesn't feel cheap or commonplace to hold, and not a whole lot of bloatware to whine about. Love it!"

"399285","Sony Xperia ZL LTE C6506 Unlocked Android Phone - US Warranty - (Red)",5,"I ultimately returned the phone to get something cheaper but this phone is every bit as good as a gs4 or htc one. I liked the fact that no one else I knew had one. The camera and screen are amazing."
"399286","Sony Xperia ZL LTE C6506 Unlocked Android Phone - US Warranty - (Red)",5,"This is perhaps the best phone I've yet had when you consider it's feature-set and design both independently and compared to it's contemporary peers.Between the small bezel and frame housing a 5"" screen, the extensive LTE support and usual high-end specs -- 1.5GHz snapdragon, 2GB memory, 12MPixel camera, 2370mAh battery -- it's an impressive piece of hardware. The industrial design is just sexy, in my opinion. I do wish it had the waterproofing of the Z or ZR, but this is a worthy trade-off in my mind for it's smaller size, especially considering my usage.I've heard a few complaints that it shipped with the Snapdragon APQ8064 processor clocked @ 1.5 and while I'll take any processor improvement I can get (Snapdragon 800 would be great), so far the UI is smooth and 1080p x264/AVC videos run well. Frankly, these phones summed over a normal usage pattern spend most of their times down-clocked, so the extra head room is only seen in edge-cases. And in the long-term, as Android advances it seems to be most sensitive to memory capacity, which all these phones have 2GB of.So, I very much like this phone. In hardware terms it's fantastic. I have no complaints and as long as Sony keeps up the quick work in porting over new Android revisions, I'll be happy."
"399287","Sony Xperia ZL LTE C6506 Unlocked Android Phone - US Warranty - (Red)",5,"By far the best smartphone I've ever had. Or used. Its not that any one feature stands out, but everything is high quality and works flawlessly. The only thing better might be the xperia z, but for those of us who don't use tmobile that doesn't help much. Other phones might have one feature with better specs, but you lose nothing overall with this one. Great video and picture quality. The viewing angle problem reported by others is greatly exaggerated. It depends more on the quality of the media being viewed."

"399290","Sony Xperia ZL LTE C6506 Unlocked Android Phone - US Warranty - (Red)",4,"A monster of a phone for the price, if you don't want to move onto the z3 or the smaller z3 compact, this is a great choice"
"399291","Sony Xperia ZL LTE C6506 Unlocked Android Phone - US Warranty - (Red)",5,"This is a great phone. I had upgraded from the Xperia TL and this phone screen is bigger and in my opinion runs faster and smoother. The phone is presently running on Kit Kat. Only small issue is that it came with the language set on Spanish out of the box."
"399292","Sony Xperia ZL LTE C6506 Unlocked Android Phone - US Warranty - (Red)",4,"Good phone, not the fastest Xperia.Support many frequency bands.Not water resistant."
"399293","Sony Xperia ZL LTE C6506 Unlocked Android Phone - US Warranty - (Red)",1,"Pros:- Top quality graphics and resolution, with great viewing angle- Fast processor- Good quality sound- Small footprint considering size of monitor- Good battery life when using power management toolsCons:- For an unlocked, non-carrier, full-price phone, Sony did not have any problems loading this thing up with useless bloatware- Inefficient use of processor, much slower than phones with a fraction of the processing power- Screen protector (shatter guard), not a scratch protector. No mention of this on Sony's documentation or website, even the retail outlets who sell this phone identify this as a scratch protector, which is already bonded to the screen. It's anything but. This pre-bonded ""screen protector"" is very, very soft and designed to prevent breaking or shattering of the screen if dropped, but will pick up scratches and get cloudy very easy if an aftermarket scratch cover is not placed on top of it. This would be good to know from the documentation, and in advance. Once it's all scratched up, there is not much that can be done without voiding the warranty. If peeled off, the Sony logo comes off with it, and the warranty is void. Moreover, Sony does not sell a replacement for this. You're stuck with an ugly cloudy, scratched up screen, or a phone with no warranty- The phone worked okay out of the box, but consistently got worse after multiple firmware updates. Some issues include: Randomly powering on/off every 10 minutes (until fixed with yet another firmware update), consistent locked screens, screen jitter, loss of touch and hardware buttons. Sometimes this phone locks up and cannot be re-booted because both the power button and touch screen become disabled. The Solution, wait for the battery to die to reboot (cannot remove the battery), or use Sony's PC companion to recover and lose all data. During a lock up, data cannot even be backed up using the USB or PC Companion software. I keep it backed up when it's working properly, and keep my phone numbers on the external SD card, because I've had to wipe it and re-install the OS so many times. I can't wait 2 or 3 days for the battery to die to use my phoneUPDATE: I downgraded this to a 1-star because it continues to be a HUGE disappoint. It randomly overheats and can burn through a full charge in 20 minutes or less. It continues to randomly reboot. Sometimes it will not recharge, just starts beeping and going in and out of recharge mode. After the last Sony (forced) software upgrade, all the settings were again set to default, with more bloatware, and more problems. It also won't keep my preferences. For example, if I change the clock style on the main screen, the next day it re-sets to another style. This phone is an absolute nightmare!"

I returned it within two weeks.1) PerformancePerformance on this device was sub-par. Despite the specs, it was always lagging and stuttering.2) User ExperienceSony felt the need to reinvent the wheel and create their own interface. There are always two or three additional items I had to touch before getting to what I need. In fact, I couldn't get mobile data to work until I found an obscure setting to enable a mobile internet connection.3) The ScreenNot only is there not any gorilla glass or anything of the kind, this screen seems to attract scratches.

"399297","Sony Xperia ZL LTE C6506 Unlocked Android Phone - US Warranty - (Red)",2,"Bought this for a friend who I had given a phone I wanted back but never sent this one to her. After it sat for a few weeks I decided to give it a test run. Connectivity is fine and while the scratch mentioned in the add is there I already knew about Sony's beautiful screens. The problems began when I made my first call. The person could not hear me. So I hung up and tried again,same. Called another person, same result switched over to speaker phone to complete the call. So obviously the microphone is not working correctly. Now after about 6 days of use for web browsing the phone no longer recognizes all power cords/usb had to try multiple before finding one that it would respond too. Needless to say happy I procrastinated in sending this phone to someone else."
"399298","Sony Xperia ZL LTE C6506 Unlocked Android Phone - US Warranty - (Red)",5,"This is one of the best phones I've had. Thin, fast, excellent camera, large screen. Though the screen is large it is the same size as the Lumia 920 I owned. The battery life is short, on heavy use only last 4 hours, on average use can last almost all day. It comes with a Sony back up feature that backs up an ""image"" of the phone into the microSD card. The PC interface is also very useful.I wish the headphone set that comes with it would be of better quality. The front facing camera placement is odd."
"399299","Sony Xperia ZL LTE C6506 Unlocked Android Phone - US Warranty - (Red)",5,"I was afraid that the red color might be too bright- it isn't. It has a dull anodized aluminum look and the shade of red is just right. The phone looks great and I am glad I didn't go for the tepid white or the faceless but neutral black (black even costs a lot more on amazon, for some reason).It updated as soon as I got it to 4.1.2 with some fixes and late June, another update took it to 4.2.2. The phone has radio capable of HSPA+ and LTE on almost all network operators in the USA, at least. The battery life is average for the phone on usage; the standby life is pretty good. The screen is gorgeous. The Sony customization is minimal and I like the themes it ships with. It has nice walkman, album and video ( and reader) apps. Call and sound Q are good. You can receive calls without unlocking.The phone is worth the money. I had considered HTC one (google play) edition for its hardware/build quality but it does not have 1700 Mhz support for HSPA. The samsung S4 (google play) costs $100 more and offers nothing for it.I hope Sony will keep updates coming at the same regularity."
"399300","Sony Xperia ZL LTE C6506 Unlocked Android Phone - US Warranty - (Red)",4,"This product,I have to return, so far my instinct works...when in doubt about a certain item, return for it will just become a headche in the end."
"399301","Sony Xperia ZL LTE C6506 Unlocked Android Phone - US Warranty - (Red)",5,"I just love Sony phones. This my 3rd Sony phone. Earlier I was using xperia ray and it was too a sneak peace developed by Sony. But with 5' display, 1080p and stunning Camera I couldn't resist to buy xperia Z. Initially I thought to buy Xperia Z but due to lack of 4G LTE support in US I decided to go with Xperia ZL. But now I don't feel any regret.Only one concern is about battery life. Sony could have done better. Nevertheless on new power management app you can rely on."
"399302","Sony Xperia ZL LTE C6506 Unlocked Android Phone - US Warranty - (Red)",5,"I used Xperia Ray then went to iPhone4 after that choose Galaxy SIII then change operating system bought Nokia Lumia 920. Everything was right except lacking of applications in WP system I came back to Android and was waiting for something Stylist and has good features. Finally I found Sony Xperia Zl and the best part of it I can use any network.I'm now using SIMPLE MOBILE and it's wroking great.So far no problem. Love the phone."
"399303","Sony Xperia ZL LTE C6506 Unlocked Android Phone - US Warranty - (Red)",4,"I love the phone, but I am not blown away by it. The complaints about the screen angles are overblown, it looks just fine - yes you will experience wash outs frequently, but really you're usually looking straight at the phone anyway.The phone feels solid as a rock, unlike my old beloved SGS2. It's also a fair bit heavier, but overall does not feel heavyThere is noticeable jitter and lag occasionally. However on the whole the phone flies through tasks, you won't think to yourself ""ah man, slow phone"".People pan the battery life, but I find it quite good. It's easy to get over a day of power out of it with medium usageI had it not even two weeks and already had a nasty drop. The front and back look great, but surprisingly the metal edges dent and scratch very easily, so I recommend some kind of protective case, even a minimal one. Sadly mine still hasn't arrived yet... dang.The white looks damn classy in person. Finger-on-screen feel is better than any other phone I've ownedSide note:Be ready to frog-march AT&T through your LTE activation process. This isn't anything to do with the phone obviously, but I spent a good 5+ hours with their support before they pulled their heads out of their butt and activated LTE properly. Be clear and be persistent if you are on AT&T and buying this phone."
"399304","Sony Xperia ZL LTE C6506 Unlocked Android Phone - US Warranty - (Red)",5,"I found it to be a great phone, great screen, great performance, excellent camera (in good light conditions), Sony additions to Android don't bother or even are good, solid construction... to summarize, I really recommend this phone.The only bad thing is that the screen has some small scratches by just putting it into my pocket, by itself, with nothing else in the same that you could say caused them."
"399305","Sony Xperia ZL LTE C6506 Unlocked Android Phone - US Warranty - (Red)",5,"There are better reviews than I could do written elsewhere, just wanted to comment a little.I have it rooted and the bootloader unlocked, running PACMan ROM(CM10.1 based) perfectly fine.If you have decent headphones the output on this tends to be a little quiet.It comes with a screen protector pre-installed. (but it still scratches easy, I ended up buying another one and plopping it on top)Once again, it's red. When I ordered this I didn't realize until a couple days later when I was looking at the order that it was, in fact, red and not black as I thought.I wasn't attached to it being black so it still looks good.Battery will last about 5 hours of non-stop video watching, or 20+ hours(I haven't gone past that yet) if you're not really using your phone much for anything(like maybe 30-60 minutes of sporadic screen usage for messaging or something in the whole day at minimum brightness)I don't see what the big fuss about viewing angles is, it doesn't render it unreadable or anything... It's not even bothersome if I'm watching a video.T-Mobile just started rolling out LTE in Los Angeles so I've been picking that up around town, I'm able to reach speeds of almost 30/10 in some areas.Overall, coming from a Samsung Exhibit II 4G aka Galaxy Exhibit 4G, I'm fairly happy with this purchase.08/14/13 Update: Still going strong, running Illusion ROM now. Also wanted to comment that if you want to use this phone on T-Mobile it's as simple as ordering a mini-SIM card from them and putting it in.(Obviously you need service too) If you already have a T-Mobile SIM card then you can take it to any T-Mobile store and they will resize it for you, otherwise it costs about $20 to get a replacement SIM.11/13/13 Update: Everything's good in Sonyland, I'm now running Omni ROM which has great performance so far, I've combined it with Xposed Framework + Modules to get back the features that are missing from other ROMs, everything works great. Battery life is pretty decent so far, depends on how much I use the screen and whether I'm on mobile data or not. If I'm at home all day on Wifi and not using my phone much besides listening to some stuff now and then and some socializing, I'm at 46% after 14 hours.Now, in the real world, when I'm working and out and about, I tend to get about 8-10 hours before I hit the 20% mark, but personally I use my phone a lot when I'm working for various things, Wifi hotspot and Wifi analyzer are probably the most draining, along with using the screen more simply to look stuff up. Some people might fare better, but even still in an age where you can find an outlet anywhere, and car chargers are fairly cheap, I don't really see any reason to be worried about the battery, unless you plan on watching videos all day, in which case you can expect the same 5 hour battery life as the Galaxy S4.Myself, I carry a 12000mAH(claimed) backup battery when I need to charge while working around since I don't like leaving my phone to sit by an outlet(plus it looks a little janky), but the only times I've truly needed this are during a convention where there was poor mobile data reception and wifi was outrageously priced, thus forcing my phone to work probably twice as hard to maintain a decent connection, thus draining the battery faster than normal.Also, I have to exclaim about the build quality on this phone as it seems to be really quite solid, due to various mishaps my phone has fallen a couple of times onto concrete from probably 3-4 feet with just some minor cosmetic damage mostly on the bottom left corner, what was really surprising was the second time I dropped it, now keep in mind I have a Skinomi screen protector which has kind of a soft springy feel to it, the second time I dropped it the phone had landed flat on it's face, when I picked it up I was amazed to see not a single scratch of damage. My running theory is that the screen protector absorbed most of the shock, but even still, whatever Sony did with this phone seems to be alright.So far though, my biggest gripe is whatever amp they used on the phone is simply not powerful enough. For the earpiece it seems to be more than adequate, but I often find myself wishing to be able to raise the volume past maximum during a call on speakerphone, and the headphone out is just simply not powerful enough for most headphones.Now, after almost half a year, would I recommend this phone to people? Maybe. If you want more accessories or stronger developer support, the Nexus 5 is a fine choice along with the Galaxy S4 and LG G2. If you want a great phone that compliments class and is different compared to most people, I would strongly suggest the ZL. If you want a phone that's waterproof, you should probably be looking at the Xperia Z or Z1 not the ZL.In the end it comes down to preference, You have the Nexus 5 which is quite nice albeit lacking any sort of excitement and a microSD slot, the Galaxy S4 which is more expensive and everybody and their mothers have one(though the replaceable battery is quite nice), the LG G2 which is pretty much the Nexus 5 but with a bigger battery and with LG's software mods, then you have the Xperia Z1 which is just a second generation Z, and finally the HTC One which not only is similar in price to the S4 but it also lacks a microSD slot.And then the ZL itself, expensive yes, but not too expensive, different from the majority in design, yet similar in performance(for the most part), if anything, the ZL is a jack of all trades, master of none, managing to exceed at not exceeding, which sounds kind of dumb but if you have the phone it kind of makes sense, it's simply a good phone, nothing more, nothing less.Honestly the most surprising part of this phone is that the battery isn't removeable, considering the Xperia ZR, which is also waterproof mind you, does include this feature.Here's hoping to a new ZL for 2014 that can truly set a name for itself.04/28/14 Update: New builds of 4.4 ROMs for this phone have been pretty damn good at managing battery life, I usually expect my phone to last at least 8-12 hours during a normal workday, though I think my record so far is 35 hours, which was staying home for 2 days and using my phone only for some podcast listening.Performance feels smoother with newer ROMs, hoping to better battery and performance once the Sony official 4.4 ROM is out.I've gone through various screen protectors at this point, mostly to experiment, I still think Skinomi is the best at actually protecting your screen but it can sometimes make the screen look a little funny.A little bit of the paint on the back has scratched off but I think that's from the fall it took before, I just never noticed.Everything else on the phone is still in perfect, functioning order."
"399306","Sony Xperia ZL LTE C6506 Unlocked Android Phone - US Warranty - (Red)",4,"Bought this phone over the Galaxy S4 because of its being a true international 4G phone and its FM radio, which the galaxy does not have. The worst thing about this phone is it camera, absolutely lame images, my old 8MP C905 produces better images than this. It does get a bit warm especially when surfing the net. Other than that this is an awesome phone, the viewing angles are not as bad as most reviews make them out to be, the colours just get washed out a bit. Its fast and snappy, just a bit of stutter at times I find, but this can be fixed with an update. If you want a true international phone this is it."

Would have been a good deal if not for that, but I thought this whole transaction was a waste of time for all involved and could have been avoided."
"399322","Sony Xperia ZL LTE C6506 Unlocked Android Phone - US Warranty - (Red)",1,"The Xperia ZL is a great piece of technology. Fast processor, excellent HD screen, reasonable battery life.Alas, for reasons unclear to me at present, the phone died within 60 days of purchase.When I say ""died"", please allow me to be more specific. I'm fairly tech-savvy, and do not remotely give up at the first sign of trouble. Alas, this phone beat me.Seemingly at random one afternoon, the phone's touch-screen stopped responding to input. So...that pretty much means the phone is, for all intents and purposes...dead. I attempted the following basic solutions:1) Factory Reset2) ""Repair"" option on the Sony Bridge / desktop app3) Reinstall OS / Flash OSUnfortunately, none of these worked. The phone, even after reinstalling the drivers and firmware, continue to be unresponsive on the touch-screen.I spoke to Sony's warranty department. And unfortunately, since I'm in Europe at the moment where the specific LTE model is not sold...I'm basically out of luck. No suggestions from Sony, other than to ship it back to a regional repair site in North America.So in the end...I spend a good $600 or so...on a phone that functioned...for about 60 days.Unfortunately, Sony's entire Z-line of products seems to be plagues with several ""instant death"" problems. Unfortunately what I experienced is not uncommon. Just dig around google a bit; you'll see.So...if you'd like to pay $10/day for a phone on average...that will become a brick within 60 days...well, look no further."

"399326","Sony Xperia ZL LTE C6506 Unlocked Android Phone - US Warranty - (Red)",5,"Fantastic Smartphone, has almost everything I need, and the only I'm missing is something most people wouldn't -and that is a dual-SIM option. I've had the C6502 version before with the alledged installed pressure sensor (as per SONY's own white papers!!) it wasn't, though. SONY, in the meantime took it out of the white papers.The one this review refers to, however, is the C6506, which is the one with LTE instead of the pressure sensor. It is really a great phone hardwarewise. SONY have the ""companion"" software in place which helps you to stay up to date with your phone along with some other services. The transfer software didn't work, so I started installing from scratch which I didn't expect. But then again, this is software which you wouldn't need all the time anyway and therefore shouldn't diminish the value of this great hardware.This phone is one of the few smartphones that has the T-Mobile 3G AWS (1700) band on board. It truly is a phone that you can use with most of its features worldwide!If I have anything that could be improved then it is the phone reception. My HTC Incredible S which I had before, has better reception. About everything else onboard my new SONY Xperia ZL (C6506) is so much better, and it still has a valuable SD card slot on board, which the NEXUS does not have -a political Google decision as they want you to use their online storage.I highly recommend this smartphone. It soon is slotted to obtain the latest Android (Kitkat)."

"399331","Sony Xperia ZL LTE C6506 Unlocked Android Phone - US Warranty - (Red)",2,"I got two of these back in 2013. Looked great. Got compliments everywhere I went but then it started getting several random issues. It suddenly stopped charging while I was in the carribean for vacation. Amazon was kind enough to let me exchange. The new one ended up having the same issue in a couple weeks. Sony advised me to only use their charger adapter and cable which is ridiculous. I consider myself tech savvy and I managed to use android sdk and reset the phone via my l laptop. Since then I have only used Sony charger without charging issues but the phone has numerous other issues. I still use one of the phones as my secondary phone. After the latest updates, most of the issues I had got resolved but created other new issues. I would never ever buy a Sony phone again. Looks very classy though, build quality is great. Dropped the phone few times, not a scratch on the screen. The sides started peeling off after 2 years but I wouldn't complain as 2 yrs is a long time for cell phone. The software and hardware bugs makes this phone a 2 star instead of the 5 star it could otherwise earned."

"399349","Sony Xperia ZL LTE C6506 Unlocked Android Phone - US Warranty - (White)",5,"The Sony Xperia ZL, a sibling of the much hyped Sony Xperia Z in the rest of the world, it's a great Android smartphone. Size wise it is similar to the earlier generation Xperia Ion so it is amazing engineers at Sony are able to pack a massive 5 inch screen into the tiny body. Though perhaps because of the sheer size of the screen, the front facing camera is placed at an awkward position which makes any kind of video calls funky.Feature wise this phone can give the Galaxy S4 a run for its money.Sony has been making great phones since separated from the failed joint venture with Ericsson. Unfortunately, the marketing arm doesn't seem to know a thing or two about the US mobile market. This phone is priced competitively with other ""unlocked"" devices like iPhone and Galaxy S4, but in the US there is almost no meaningful market for ""unlocked"" devices. US consumers are so accustomed to device pricing with network subsidies from 2-year contracts they will scream at $500+ price tags for smartphones even though that is how much these phones are priced outside the US."

This one fits the bill and will function on both the ATT lte network and T Moblil's new lte network. Overall, this phone performs very well. While a longer battery life would be nice, it does a very good job of managing what it has and I can generally count on 2 full days between charges.The IPS screen is sharp and bright. Video playback is smooth. NFC provided some surprising benefits in managing the phones configuration as well as file transfers etc. Given the breadth of function this phone is a good value."

"399353","Sony Xperia ZL LTE C6506 Unlocked Android Phone - US Warranty - (White)",5,"Technologist and early adopter here (sort of). Sony has made a great product with the Xperia ZL. I did my research and upgraded from a 2yr old Samsung Galaxy S2 which was starting to freeze and just being a complete inconvenience. The Xperia ZL is a gorgeous phone with lots of very cool features (check out the tech specs from any reputable site). Battery life is good (with the Stamina mode), doesn't feel cheap or commonplace to hold, and not a whole lot of bloatware to whine about. Love it!"

"399357","Sony Xperia ZL LTE C6506 Unlocked Android Phone - US Warranty - (White)",5,"This is perhaps the best phone I've yet had when you consider it's feature-set and design both independently and compared to it's contemporary peers.Between the small bezel and frame housing a 5"" screen, the extensive LTE support and usual high-end specs -- 1.5GHz snapdragon, 2GB memory, 12MPixel camera, 2370mAh battery -- it's an impressive piece of hardware. The industrial design is just sexy, in my opinion. I do wish it had the waterproofing of the Z or ZR, but this is a worthy trade-off in my mind for it's smaller size, especially considering my usage.I've heard a few complaints that it shipped with the Snapdragon APQ8064 processor clocked @ 1.5 and while I'll take any processor improvement I can get (Snapdragon 800 would be great), so far the UI is smooth and 1080p x264/AVC videos run well. Frankly, these phones summed over a normal usage pattern spend most of their times down-clocked, so the extra head room is only seen in edge-cases. And in the long-term, as Android advances it seems to be most sensitive to memory capacity, which all these phones have 2GB of.So, I very much like this phone. In hardware terms it's fantastic. I have no complaints and as long as Sony keeps up the quick work in porting over new Android revisions, I'll be happy."
"399358","Sony Xperia ZL LTE C6506 Unlocked Android Phone - US Warranty - (White)",5,"By far the best smartphone I've ever had. Or used. Its not that any one feature stands out, but everything is high quality and works flawlessly. The only thing better might be the xperia z, but for those of us who don't use tmobile that doesn't help much. Other phones might have one feature with better specs, but you lose nothing overall with this one. Great video and picture quality. The viewing angle problem reported by others is greatly exaggerated. It depends more on the quality of the media being viewed."

Other than that I have no issues with the mobile. The operation was fast and smooth. May be my problem was I dropped the phone couple of times."

"399362","Sony Xperia ZL LTE C6506 Unlocked Android Phone - US Warranty - (White)",2,"I got two of these back in 2013. Looked great. Got compliments everywhere I went but then it started getting several random issues. It suddenly stopped charging while I was in the carribean for vacation. Amazon was kind enough to let me exchange. The new one ended up having the same issue in a couple weeks. Sony advised me to only use their charger adapter and cable which is ridiculous. I consider myself tech savvy and I managed to use android sdk and reset the phone via my l laptop. Since then I have only used Sony charger without charging issues but the phone has numerous other issues. I still use one of the phones as my secondary phone. After the latest updates, most of the issues I had got resolved but created other new issues. I would never ever buy a Sony phone again. Looks very classy though, build quality is great. Dropped the phone few times, not a scratch on the screen. The sides started peeling off after 2 years but I wouldn't complain as 2 yrs is a long time for cell phone. The software and hardware bugs makes this phone a 2 star instead of the 5 star it could otherwise earned."

No mention of this on Sony's documentation or website, even the retail outlets who sell this phone identify this as a scratch protector, which is already bonded to the screen. It's anything but. This pre-bonded ""screen protector"" is very, very soft and designed to prevent breaking or shattering of the screen if dropped, but will pick up scratches and get cloudy very easy if an aftermarket scratch cover is not placed on top of it. This would be good to know from the documentation, and in advance. Once it's all scratched up, there is not much that can be done without voiding the warranty. If peeled off, the Sony logo comes off with it, and the warranty is void. Moreover, Sony does not sell a replacement for this. You're stuck with an ugly cloudy, scratched up screen, or a phone with no warranty- The phone worked okay out of the box, but consistently got worse after multiple firmware updates. Some issues include: Randomly powering on/off every 10 minutes (until fixed with yet another firmware update), consistent locked screens, screen jitter, loss of touch and hardware buttons. Sometimes this phone locks up and cannot be re-booted because both the power button and touch screen become disabled. The Solution, wait for the battery to die to reboot (cannot remove the battery), or use Sony's PC companion to recover and lose all data. During a lock up, data cannot even be backed up using the USB or PC Companion software. I keep it backed up when it's working properly, and keep my phone numbers on the external SD card, because I've had to wipe it and re-install the OS so many times. I can't wait 2 or 3 days for the battery to die to use my phoneUPDATE: I downgraded this to a 1-star because it continues to be a HUGE disappoint. It randomly overheats and can burn through a full charge in 20 minutes or less. It continues to randomly reboot. Sometimes it will not recharge, just starts beeping and going in and out of recharge mode. After the last Sony (forced) software upgrade, all the settings were again set to default, with more bloatware, and more problems. It also won't keep my preferences. For example, if I change the clock style on the main screen, the next day it re-sets to another style. This phone is an absolute nightmare!"

The voice recognition for auto dialing.... it often does not understand regardless of how clear I speak... it also gets stuck - I have to shut the phone down to reset that function. Otherwise it seems like a nice phone so far."
"399400","Sony Xperia ZL LTE C6506 Unlocked Android Phone - US Warranty - (White)",5,"This is one of the best phones I've had. Thin, fast, excellent camera, large screen. Though the screen is large it is the same size as the Lumia 920 I owned. The battery life is short, on heavy use only last 4 hours, on average use can last almost all day. It comes with a Sony back up feature that backs up an ""image"" of the phone into the microSD card. The PC interface is also very useful.I wish the headphone set that comes with it would be of better quality. The front facing camera placement is odd."
"399401","Sony Xperia ZL LTE C6506 Unlocked Android Phone - US Warranty - (White)",5,"I was afraid that the red color might be too bright- it isn't. It has a dull anodized aluminum look and the shade of red is just right. The phone looks great and I am glad I didn't go for the tepid white or the faceless but neutral black (black even costs a lot more on amazon, for some reason).It updated as soon as I got it to 4.1.2 with some fixes and late June, another update took it to 4.2.2. The phone has radio capable of HSPA+ and LTE on almost all network operators in the USA, at least. The battery life is average for the phone on usage; the standby life is pretty good. The screen is gorgeous. The Sony customization is minimal and I like the themes it ships with. It has nice walkman, album and video ( and reader) apps. Call and sound Q are good. You can receive calls without unlocking.The phone is worth the money. I had considered HTC one (google play) edition for its hardware/build quality but it does not have 1700 Mhz support for HSPA. The samsung S4 (google play) costs $100 more and offers nothing for it.I hope Sony will keep updates coming at the same regularity."
"399402","Sony Xperia ZL LTE C6506 Unlocked Android Phone - US Warranty - (White)",4,"This product,I have to return, so far my instinct works...when in doubt about a certain item, return for it will just become a headche in the end."
"399403","Sony Xperia ZL LTE C6506 Unlocked Android Phone - US Warranty - (White)",5,"I just love Sony phones. This my 3rd Sony phone. Earlier I was using xperia ray and it was too a sneak peace developed by Sony. But with 5' display, 1080p and stunning Camera I couldn't resist to buy xperia Z. Initially I thought to buy Xperia Z but due to lack of 4G LTE support in US I decided to go with Xperia ZL. But now I don't feel any regret.Only one concern is about battery life. Sony could have done better. Nevertheless on new power management app you can rely on."
"399404","Sony Xperia ZL LTE C6506 Unlocked Android Phone - US Warranty - (White)",5,"I used Xperia Ray then went to iPhone4 after that choose Galaxy SIII then change operating system bought Nokia Lumia 920. Everything was right except lacking of applications in WP system I came back to Android and was waiting for something Stylist and has good features. Finally I found Sony Xperia Zl and the best part of it I can use any network.I'm now using SIMPLE MOBILE and it's wroking great.So far no problem. Love the phone."
"399405","Sony Xperia ZL LTE C6506 Unlocked Android Phone - US Warranty - (White)",4,"I love the phone, but I am not blown away by it. The complaints about the screen angles are overblown, it looks just fine - yes you will experience wash outs frequently, but really you're usually looking straight at the phone anyway.The phone feels solid as a rock, unlike my old beloved SGS2. It's also a fair bit heavier, but overall does not feel heavyThere is noticeable jitter and lag occasionally. However on the whole the phone flies through tasks, you won't think to yourself ""ah man, slow phone"".People pan the battery life, but I find it quite good. It's easy to get over a day of power out of it with medium usageI had it not even two weeks and already had a nasty drop. The front and back look great, but surprisingly the metal edges dent and scratch very easily, so I recommend some kind of protective case, even a minimal one. Sadly mine still hasn't arrived yet... dang.The white looks damn classy in person. Finger-on-screen feel is better than any other phone I've ownedSide note:Be ready to frog-march AT&T through your LTE activation process. This isn't anything to do with the phone obviously, but I spent a good 5+ hours with their support before they pulled their heads out of their butt and activated LTE properly. Be clear and be persistent if you are on AT&T and buying this phone."
"399406","Sony Xperia ZL LTE C6506 Unlocked Android Phone - US Warranty - (White)",5,"I found it to be a great phone, great screen, great performance, excellent camera (in good light conditions), Sony additions to Android don't bother or even are good, solid construction... to summarize, I really recommend this phone.The only bad thing is that the screen has some small scratches by just putting it into my pocket, by itself, with nothing else in the same that you could say caused them."
"399407","Sony Xperia ZL LTE C6506 Unlocked Android Phone - US Warranty - (White)",5,"There are better reviews than I could do written elsewhere, just wanted to comment a little.I have it rooted and the bootloader unlocked, running PACMan ROM(CM10.1 based) perfectly fine.If you have decent headphones the output on this tends to be a little quiet.It comes with a screen protector pre-installed. (but it still scratches easy, I ended up buying another one and plopping it on top)Once again, it's red. When I ordered this I didn't realize until a couple days later when I was looking at the order that it was, in fact, red and not black as I thought.I wasn't attached to it being black so it still looks good.Battery will last about 5 hours of non-stop video watching, or 20+ hours(I haven't gone past that yet) if you're not really using your phone much for anything(like maybe 30-60 minutes of sporadic screen usage for messaging or something in the whole day at minimum brightness)I don't see what the big fuss about viewing angles is, it doesn't render it unreadable or anything... It's not even bothersome if I'm watching a video.T-Mobile just started rolling out LTE in Los Angeles so I've been picking that up around town, I'm able to reach speeds of almost 30/10 in some areas.Overall, coming from a Samsung Exhibit II 4G aka Galaxy Exhibit 4G, I'm fairly happy with this purchase.08/14/13 Update: Still going strong, running Illusion ROM now. Also wanted to comment that if you want to use this phone on T-Mobile it's as simple as ordering a mini-SIM card from them and putting it in.(Obviously you need service too) If you already have a T-Mobile SIM card then you can take it to any T-Mobile store and they will resize it for you, otherwise it costs about $20 to get a replacement SIM.11/13/13 Update: Everything's good in Sonyland, I'm now running Omni ROM which has great performance so far, I've combined it with Xposed Framework + Modules to get back the features that are missing from other ROMs, everything works great. Battery life is pretty decent so far, depends on how much I use the screen and whether I'm on mobile data or not. If I'm at home all day on Wifi and not using my phone much besides listening to some stuff now and then and some socializing, I'm at 46% after 14 hours.Now, in the real world, when I'm working and out and about, I tend to get about 8-10 hours before I hit the 20% mark, but personally I use my phone a lot when I'm working for various things, Wifi hotspot and Wifi analyzer are probably the most draining, along with using the screen more simply to look stuff up. Some people might fare better, but even still in an age where you can find an outlet anywhere, and car chargers are fairly cheap, I don't really see any reason to be worried about the battery, unless you plan on watching videos all day, in which case you can expect the same 5 hour battery life as the Galaxy S4.Myself, I carry a 12000mAH(claimed) backup battery when I need to charge while working around since I don't like leaving my phone to sit by an outlet(plus it looks a little janky), but the only times I've truly needed this are during a convention where there was poor mobile data reception and wifi was outrageously priced, thus forcing my phone to work probably twice as hard to maintain a decent connection, thus draining the battery faster than normal.Also, I have to exclaim about the build quality on this phone as it seems to be really quite solid, due to various mishaps my phone has fallen a couple of times onto concrete from probably 3-4 feet with just some minor cosmetic damage mostly on the bottom left corner, what was really surprising was the second time I dropped it, now keep in mind I have a Skinomi screen protector which has kind of a soft springy feel to it, the second time I dropped it the phone had landed flat on it's face, when I picked it up I was amazed to see not a single scratch of damage. My running theory is that the screen protector absorbed most of the shock, but even still, whatever Sony did with this phone seems to be alright.So far though, my biggest gripe is whatever amp they used on the phone is simply not powerful enough. For the earpiece it seems to be more than adequate, but I often find myself wishing to be able to raise the volume past maximum during a call on speakerphone, and the headphone out is just simply not powerful enough for most headphones.Now, after almost half a year, would I recommend this phone to people? Maybe. If you want more accessories or stronger developer support, the Nexus 5 is a fine choice along with the Galaxy S4 and LG G2. If you want a great phone that compliments class and is different compared to most people, I would strongly suggest the ZL. If you want a phone that's waterproof, you should probably be looking at the Xperia Z or Z1 not the ZL.In the end it comes down to preference, You have the Nexus 5 which is quite nice albeit lacking any sort of excitement and a microSD slot, the Galaxy S4 which is more expensive and everybody and their mothers have one(though the replaceable battery is quite nice), the LG G2 which is pretty much the Nexus 5 but with a bigger battery and with LG's software mods, then you have the Xperia Z1 which is just a second generation Z, and finally the HTC One which not only is similar in price to the S4 but it also lacks a microSD slot.And then the ZL itself, expensive yes, but not too expensive, different from the majority in design, yet similar in performance(for the most part), if anything, the ZL is a jack of all trades, master of none, managing to exceed at not exceeding, which sounds kind of dumb but if you have the phone it kind of makes sense, it's simply a good phone, nothing more, nothing less.Honestly the most surprising part of this phone is that the battery isn't removeable, considering the Xperia ZR, which is also waterproof mind you, does include this feature.Here's hoping to a new ZL for 2014 that can truly set a name for itself.04/28/14 Update: New builds of 4.4 ROMs for this phone have been pretty damn good at managing battery life, I usually expect my phone to last at least 8-12 hours during a normal workday, though I think my record so far is 35 hours, which was staying home for 2 days and using my phone only for some podcast listening.Performance feels smoother with newer ROMs, hoping to better battery and performance once the Sony official 4.4 ROM is out.I've gone through various screen protectors at this point, mostly to experiment, I still think Skinomi is the best at actually protecting your screen but it can sometimes make the screen look a little funny.A little bit of the paint on the back has scratched off but I think that's from the fall it took before, I just never noticed.Everything else on the phone is still in perfect, functioning order."
"399408","Sony Xperia ZL LTE C6506 Unlocked Android Phone - US Warranty - (White)",4,"Bought this phone over the Galaxy S4 because of its being a true international 4G phone and its FM radio, which the galaxy does not have. The worst thing about this phone is it camera, absolutely lame images, my old 8MP C905 produces better images than this. It does get a bit warm especially when surfing the net. Other than that this is an awesome phone, the viewing angles are not as bad as most reviews make them out to be, the colours just get washed out a bit. Its fast and snappy, just a bit of stutter at times I find, but this can be fixed with an update. If you want a true international phone this is it."

"399412","Sony Xperia ZL LTE C6506 Unlocked Android Phone - US Warranty - (White)",5,"Very satisfied with this phone. One of the great functions is the remote control via infrared that allow you to control many devices.

"399413","Sony Xperia ZL LTE C6506 Unlocked Android Phone - US Warranty - (White)",1,"The phone didn't work properly straight from the package. It was obvious that this device wasn't tested since it was refurbished and you would think that would be taken care of prior. Would have been a good deal if not for that, but I thought this whole transaction was a waste of time for all involved and could have been avoided."
"399414","Sony Xperia ZL LTE C6506 Unlocked Android Phone - US Warranty - (White)",1,"The Xperia ZL is a great piece of technology. Fast processor, excellent HD screen, reasonable battery life.Alas, for reasons unclear to me at present, the phone died within 60 days of purchase.When I say ""died"", please allow me to be more specific. I'm fairly tech-savvy, and do not remotely give up at the first sign of trouble. Alas, this phone beat me.Seemingly at random one afternoon, the phone's touch-screen stopped responding to input. So...that pretty much means the phone is, for all intents and purposes...dead. I attempted the following basic solutions:1) Factory Reset2) ""Repair"" option on the Sony Bridge / desktop app3) Reinstall OS / Flash OSUnfortunately, none of these worked. The phone, even after reinstalling the drivers and firmware, continue to be unresponsive on the touch-screen.I spoke to Sony's warranty department. And unfortunately, since I'm in Europe at the moment where the specific LTE model is not sold...I'm basically out of luck. No suggestions from Sony, other than to ship it back to a regional repair site in North America.So in the end...I spend a good $600 or so...on a phone that functioned...for about 60 days.Unfortunately, Sony's entire Z-line of products seems to be plagues with several ""instant death"" problems. Unfortunately what I experienced is not uncommon. Just dig around google a bit; you'll see.So...if you'd like to pay $10/day for a phone on average...that will become a brick within 60 days...well, look no further."
"399415","Sony Xperia ZL LTE C6506 Unlocked Android Phone - US Warranty - (White)",5,"This phone works like a charm! Sony out did themselves with this one!

"399418","Sony Xperia ZL LTE C6506 Unlocked Android Phone - US Warranty - (White)",5,"Fantastic Smartphone, has almost everything I need, and the only I'm missing is something most people wouldn't -and that is a dual-SIM option. I've had the C6502 version before with the alledged installed pressure sensor (as per SONY's own white papers!!) it wasn't, though. SONY, in the meantime took it out of the white papers.The one this review refers to, however, is the C6506, which is the one with LTE instead of the pressure sensor. It is really a great phone hardwarewise. SONY have the ""companion"" software in place which helps you to stay up to date with your phone along with some other services. The transfer software didn't work, so I started installing from scratch which I didn't expect. But then again, this is software which you wouldn't need all the time anyway and therefore shouldn't diminish the value of this great hardware.This phone is one of the few smartphones that has the T-Mobile 3G AWS (1700) band on board. It truly is a phone that you can use with most of its features worldwide!If I have anything that could be improved then it is the phone reception. My HTC Incredible S which I had before, has better reception. About everything else onboard my new SONY Xperia ZL (C6506) is so much better, and it still has a valuable SD card slot on board, which the NEXUS does not have -a political Google decision as they want you to use their online storage.I highly recommend this smartphone. It soon is slotted to obtain the latest Android (Kitkat)."

"399420","Sony Xperia ZR C5502 Unlocked GSM IP58-Certified WaterProof Smartphone w/ 13MP Camera and Dust Resistant - White",1,"Bluetooth and wifi HARDWARE problems out of the box. no fix for it, google it before purchasing! (pushing on the back case clips back in the component to make it temporarily work)This review is based on a four day experience with the phone on at&t, I am a power user so I had plenty of time to get frustrated with it.PROS: Great size, sd card slot, camera button, battery life, notification light/bar, water resistant (I would never try to claim water proof on an electronic device), great specs.CONS: EXTREMELY washed out and over saturated screen, bluetooth and wifi do not work on my particular device and is a common problem, 0.3 megapixel front facing camera (should have just excluded it as its useless), volume button location should be above power button.I will start out by saying I chose this phone because I only use phones that are able to be used one handed. This one stretches the capabilities of that over my preferred 4.3"" screens but the low bezel makes it easier then all the others. I have been waiting months for the z1 compact to come stateside and grew impatient and decided to try a similar phone to get used to the sony platform.Sony's ui is certainly not sense or touchwiz quality but it does provide some beautiful icons and apps but is missing alot of features.The screen on this device is horrible, facebook, snapchat, instagram, youtube apps looks oddly colored due to this. Very over saturated and washed out. facebook is purple compared to the normal blue you would expect to see on any other device. custom roms may or may not fix this, I never got the chance to root my device.Rear camera takes amazing photos, camera app is odd coming from cm11 and sense but is feature rich. I mistakingly never read the specs on the front camera and it turned out to be a horrible mistake. Front camera is 0.3 megapixels with no focus. unusable.Battery life is amazing! I have never had a phone that could keep up with my usage and not need three or four bateries swapped out during theday. This device literally lasted all day on a charge and asked for more.I would not recommend this device to anyone. There are plenty other devices out there that surpass the specs for this big of a screen. Feel free to comment or ask any questions."

"399425","Sony Xperia ZR C5502 Unlocked GSM IP58-Certified WaterProof Smartphone w/ 13MP Camera and Dust Resistant - White",4,"Out of the box, I was expecting less. Historically, I have used Motorola products. I'm coming from the Moto Droid Maxx which was a 2 year disappointment. Quality was a major expectation from Xperia, however, I did consider the price point for the phone.What I like: removable battery; customizable lock screen; quick access to camera from lock screen; customizable UI; out of the box plug and play support for t-mobile; 10 MBPS download on HPSA+ in NOVA/Washington DC area; solid feeling you would expect from Sony; integration with PS3 controller and other Sony products; good call quality; multiple keyboard layouts pre-installed; poor viewing angles make for privacy on a crowded subway;What I don't like: slower camera; LCD screen contrast (to be expected); no 4G LTE; proprietary USB cable requirements (to be expected as an experienced Sony User);When you take the galaxy S4 and do a side by side comparison, you will be blown away by the Samsung Screen. It will make the Sony's look out dated. However, you would be comparing a phone that costs $200 more. The Xperia is a great buy for the price. I am wanting a long term phone I wont have to replace. I expect over time this phone will last."

"399433","Sony Xperia ZR C5502 Unlocked GSM IP58-Certified WaterProof Smartphone w/ 13MP Camera and Dust Resistant - White",4,"I got this for ~$250 new. I have to say, it is an excellent mid-ranger even though the phone is already a year old from launch. I don't know why this phone isn't more popular. It has specs comparable to the Moto X, but is cheaper and with more hardware features such as a micro-sd slot, removable battery, and has certified water-resistance. It even has a dedicated camera shutter button!Sure there are some that will receive a phone hardware defects, but those are usually made rather obvious within the seller's return period, and while some people have battery draining problems with 4.4.2 KitKat, it could be circumvented after looking in the xda forums.Now, there is something that I don't like. The flap on the headphones. They should have nano-coated jack since it is a hassle to open.Now, for some tips, you should definitely get a screen protector as soon as you receive it. The Anti-shatter film is easily scratched. Luckily, it does come with a matte screen protector aside from the anti-shatter film, but it is easily taken off.Getting a dock is also recommended since it would prevent the loosening of the flap on the micro-usb port."

I can complain that Play Services can get frustrating in being a battery hog on this phone at times,... that and Media Services too. But, with some light tinkering I got to work around it. A change in settings and disabling apps I don't use solved that quick! The Xperia UI is clean and aesthetically pleasing without too much excessive bloatware (TouchWiz... *cough-cough*). I have found at least 70% of the additional features useful to some extent ESPECIALLY the powersaving features. The camera is also extremely good for being a ""mid-tier"" phone, having a 13MP and all. Also, as for the design of the exterior is great, having the right curves and angles as well as waterproofing/dustproofing.... The removable battery and the MicroSD card slot is a very much more welcome addition!!!So far, I love it! Sony didn't have to try too hard, and I am very impressed! I think I am a new Sony fan.... lol.It got her super fast, so the shipping was definitely great!Ps: every tap on the screen sounds the same as my PS3 and old Ps Vita, lol!!!"

Easy to use, however you need to consult USER MANUAL for using all the features. I am using it on T-Mobile. Quality of reception is very good. I use a number of portable MP 3 players. This phone has by far the best music player. In order to download you need Sony media soft ware. It is a pleasure to use the player. Quality of in built speaker is OK. It it difficult to customize the music, such as set high base and low treble. Battery life is not very good and you will have to charge every day. Rear cover is made of plastic, and should be carefully removed and re installed. I did not check if it is waterproof, however annoying, each time you turn on, it flashes its water proof feature..Overall I recommend this phone"

This is a much welcomed upgrade and I was always a fan of Sony phones before. This is my first in their Xperia line and it's looking good so far. I didn't want to go to big with a 5"" screen so I settled for this and it's perfect. The display is very crisp and bright. Yeah the viewing angles could use a little work but I'm not the one to care much about that. The nice 13mp camera on the back is very nice, producing sharp images and good performance overall. The front camera on the other hand is a sad little .3mp which I couldn't understand. Everything else about this phone is high end except for that. Fortunately, I don't take a lot of selfies but if you do, look elsewhere. Performance is snappy and is in line with today's modern phones. Battery life is amazing, especially paired with their power saving features as well as having changeable batteries. The waterproof works superb as long as you secure all the ports and the back plate. I'll be interested to see what else comes down the Xperia line but so far so good."

"399447","Sony Xperia ZR C5502 Unlocked GSM IP58-Certified WaterProof Smartphone w/ 13MP Camera and Dust Resistant - White",1,"wont buy similar things again, don't take such so call waterproof or water resistant too seriously.i like and have quite a few sony products, when i lost my previous phone to water i selected this zr as replacement, what it attracted me most is the up to IP58 level of waterproof ability, and a physical camer shoot button which make under water photo easier, the under water video captured by zr on youtube encouraged me much to make the choice. another thing i like is zr's easy-to-replace battery.so even though Sony didn't release this model in Singapore, i still order it when i traveled to US. i did like it at the first glance when it arrived at my hand, hand feel was good, strong cpu and ample ram let apps run smoothly, anytime it need a clean i just put it under water tap and washed to shine.but waterproof finally proved not so strong. last month i had my vacation at Thailand to found i don't have the lucky to take underwater photo or video as shown on net. i brought it to snorkeling, tide it up and wrap it on my hand, confirm all the caps were locked then went into the sea, several minutes later the screen was off but long pressing the shot button could not wake it up, i went up to check and confirm it worked then back to water again, still the same. so i went up to boat again and turn it off, left it there. totally my zr was in water no more than 15 minutes. when i finished snorkeling and came back to boat, i found the start up image was distorted, so i immediately dismount the battery. later when i return back to hotel and check again, the screen show only color lines.what's wrong? on boat i had checked the back cover, no water run into the battery cabin, which is protected by an orange rubber circle, the battery was safe and now i can still mount it to and power on the phone. the fatal issue was seen when i put it under light, under the screen, there was one long water mark run from one corner to the opposite one, but the phone itself looks okay, no marks, no dent around the screen.another thing i want to mention is, i once read zr is strengthen to make it last longer in swimming pool and sea water, but my zr's back cover now looks very bad, thought i didn't wash it after that day, i never expect it would like that.here i try to give a reason: i suspect the data that zr can stay under 1.5 meter depth water for 30 minutes, was a test result in static water, while snorkeling, i wont dive into the water or else wather will run into my mouth, and my hand cannot be 1.5 meter long that would be too odd. but the water still can run into the screen because when i stroke the water, my handphone also moved, so there was some pressure on the side that push the water, while on the other side the pressure was less, the pressure difference might be big enough to drive water run into the first side till the other end. so my conclusion is, these so called waterproof hand phones are not so practical for underwater photo, you better not move fast, or you better put it in a watertight bag but that would make your choice of such device meaningless. BUT, for everyday use, the feature is still good, at least you can happily wash it from time to time.another negative point for this device is: i can't find a hole to put though a hand ring then hold it. i think it also reflect that Sony doesn't expect you will swim when you hold it in water, or else most likely you would lost it soon.my last unhappiness is: they didn't release it in SG, so don't know where to replace the screen even i would like to pay."
"399448","Sony Xperia ZR C5502 Unlocked GSM IP58-Certified WaterProof Smartphone w/ 13MP Camera and Dust Resistant - White",1,"Completely dissapointed with the phone. It suddenly ran off after only 5 months. Bluetooth did not work since the beggining, mobile data stopped working after a few months too. And about a week ago it started to shut down restart by its own. I contacted Sony and Galactics, but none of them gives me a solution. I wasted $300."
"399449","Sony Xperia ZR C5502 Unlocked GSM IP58-Certified WaterProof Smartphone w/ 13MP Camera and Dust Resistant - White",1,"The phone is great. But Sony customer service is awful. I sent my phone to get fix under warranty, or at least they promised me to let me know if it s still covered or not, or if there would be any charge they promised me to let me know. I sent the phone with Fedex. I got signature of their employee. But after 3 months no one gave me straight answer. They promised me to call back or email back, but they just lied. Until today I have not clue what is going on with my phone, and I lost my 400 dollars phone.My bank, Chase called them, and they lied to my bank. Said there is no Xperia ZR under my RMA. I have the tracking proof, and they told me they have it on the log when I called them before Chase made the phone call."

I was hoping they would release the new version of Android before my return window closed in case that would resolve those issues.

"399468","Sony Xperia ZR C5502 Unlocked GSM IP58-Certified WaterProof Smartphone w/ 13MP Camera and Dust Resistant - White",5,"This phone was surprisingly awesome. I researched it and read lots of great things. I expected the phone to let me down but it met all expectations and even surpassed some. It has great features. I love the face recognition security feature, even though it can be tricked. The indicator light is a bar at the bottom, below the screen. The light can be customized with different colors if you download an app. The picture is great. My hands are small so the size of the phone is perfect. I have tested the phones water resistance and it keeps its promise. It was in the river and my iPhone was killed but the Sony was ok, just muddy. I had no problems with the microphone afterward, as some say they do. It was a great feeling rinsing it off later. If I was going to complain, It would be that after using other phones, I wished it had soft buttons and a hard home button below the viewing screen. The buttons appear at the bottom of the screen, or on the side if in landscape, and use part of the viewing area. But the way its done is good. I expected it to feel cheap because they call it the Mid-range version of the z series. I have bought the c5502 and it has H+ and 3G but does not have 4G LTE. I think the c5503 has 4G. I bought this version understanding that because it is compatible with AT&T and T-Mobile. I wanted flexibility and options with my service providers. I use this phone with straight talk on the AT&T network and it works fantastic in my area. The processes run smooth and quick. This phone received an updated to 4.4.2 and did experience battery drain, but it seems to be fine now after some other apps have had updates. I'm hoping Sony will give it another update before it is too old. The Sony preloaded apps are more useful than bloatware that came with my Samsung Galaxy S3. I was a little disappointed you cant scroll through the home screens seamlessly, once you scroll to the last one it requires you to return the other way. The phone allows a microSD for extra memory but it will not allow you to transfer apps to the card. I'm hoping another update will change that. The phone has plenty of memory for my apps, but I would like the option for more."

I have to say, it is an excellent mid-ranger even though the phone is already a year old from launch. I don't know why this phone isn't more popular. It has specs comparable to the Moto X, but is cheaper and with more hardware features such as a micro-sd slot, removable battery, and has certified water-resistance. It even has a dedicated camera shutter button!Sure there are some that will receive a phone hardware defects, but those are usually made rather obvious within the seller's return period, and while some people have battery draining problems with 4.4.2 KitKat, it could be circumvented after looking in the xda forums.Now, there is something that I don't like. The flap on the headphones. They should have nano-coated jack since it is a hassle to open.Now, for some tips, you should definitely get a screen protector as soon as you receive it. The Anti-shatter film is easily scratched. Luckily, it does come with a matte screen protector aside from the anti-shatter film, but it is easily taken off.Getting a dock is also recommended since it would prevent the loosening of the flap on the micro-usb port."

I can complain that Play Services can get frustrating in being a battery hog on this phone at times,... that and Media Services too. But, with some light tinkering I got to work around it. A change in settings and disabling apps I don't use solved that quick! The Xperia UI is clean and aesthetically pleasing without too much excessive bloatware (TouchWiz... *cough-cough*). I have found at least 70% of the additional features useful to some extent ESPECIALLY the powersaving features. The camera is also extremely good for being a ""mid-tier"" phone, having a 13MP and all. Also, as for the design of the exterior is great, having the right curves and angles as well as waterproofing/dustproofing.... The removable battery and the MicroSD card slot is a very much more welcome addition!!!So far, I love it! Sony didn't have to try too hard, and I am very impressed! I think I am a new Sony fan.... lol.It got her super fast, so the shipping was definitely great!Ps: every tap on the screen sounds the same as my PS3 and old Ps Vita, lol!!!"

Easy to use, however you need to consult USER MANUAL for using all the features. I am using it on T-Mobile. Quality of reception is very good. I use a number of portable MP 3 players. This phone has by far the best music player. In order to download you need Sony media soft ware. It is a pleasure to use the player. Quality of in built speaker is OK. It it difficult to customize the music, such as set high base and low treble. Battery life is not very good and you will have to charge every day.

This is a much welcomed upgrade and I was always a fan of Sony phones before. This is my first in their Xperia line and it's looking good so far. I didn't want to go to big with a 5"" screen so I settled for this and it's perfect. The display is very crisp and bright. Yeah the viewing angles could use a little work but I'm not the one to care much about that. The nice 13mp camera on the back is very nice, producing sharp images and good performance overall. The front camera on the other hand is a sad little .3mp which I couldn't understand. Everything else about this phone is high end except for that. Fortunately, I don't take a lot of selfies but if you do, look elsewhere. Performance is snappy and is in line with today's modern phones. Battery life is amazing, especially paired with their power saving features as well as having changeable batteries. The waterproof works superb as long as you secure all the ports and the back plate.

"399498","Sony Xperia ZR C5502 Unlocked Phone--U.S. Warranty (Black)",5,"This phone was surprisingly awesome. I researched it and read lots of great things. I expected the phone to let me down but it met all expectations and even surpassed some. It has great features. I love the face recognition security feature, even though it can be tricked. The indicator light is a bar at the bottom, below the screen. The light can be customized with different colors if you download an app. The picture is great. My hands are small so the size of the phone is perfect. I have tested the phones water resistance and it keeps its promise. It was in the river and my iPhone was killed but the Sony was ok, just muddy. I had no problems with the microphone afterward, as some say they do. It was a great feeling rinsing it off later. If I was going to complain, It would be that after using other phones, I wished it had soft buttons and a hard home button below the viewing screen. The buttons appear at the bottom of the screen, or on the side if in landscape, and use part of the viewing area. But the way its done is good. I expected it to feel cheap because they call it the Mid-range version of the z series. I have bought the c5502 and it has H+ and 3G but does not have 4G LTE. I think the c5503 has 4G. I bought this version understanding that because it is compatible with AT&T and T-Mobile. I wanted flexibility and options with my service providers. I use this phone with straight talk on the AT&T network and it works fantastic in my area. The processes run smooth and quick. This phone received an updated to 4.4.2 and did experience battery drain, but it seems to be fine now after some other apps have had updates. I'm hoping Sony will give it another update before it is too old. The Sony preloaded apps are more useful than bloatware that came with my Samsung Galaxy S3. I was a little disappointed you cant scroll through the home screens seamlessly, once you scroll to the last one it requires you to return the other way. The phone allows a microSD for extra memory but it will not allow you to transfer apps to the card. I'm hoping another update will change that. The phone has plenty of memory for my apps, but I would like the option for more."

"399500","Sony Xperia ZR C5502 Unlocked Phone--U.S. Warranty (Black)",1,"Bluetooth and wifi HARDWARE problems out of the box. no fix for it, google it before purchasing! (pushing on the back case clips back in the component to make it temporarily work)This review is based on a four day experience with the phone on at&t, I am a power user so I had plenty of time to get frustrated with it.PROS: Great size, sd card slot, camera button, battery life, notification light/bar, water resistant (I would never try to claim water proof on an electronic device), great specs.CONS: EXTREMELY washed out and over saturated screen, bluetooth and wifi do not work on my particular device and is a common problem, 0.3 megapixel front facing camera (should have just excluded it as its useless), volume button location should be above power button.I will start out by saying I chose this phone because I only use phones that are able to be used one handed. This one stretches the capabilities of that over my preferred 4.3"" screens but the low bezel makes it easier then all the others. I have been waiting months for the z1 compact to come stateside and grew impatient and decided to try a similar phone to get used to the sony platform.Sony's ui is certainly not sense or touchwiz quality but it does provide some beautiful icons and apps but is missing alot of features.The screen on this device is horrible, facebook, snapchat, instagram, youtube apps looks oddly colored due to this. Very over saturated and washed out. facebook is purple compared to the normal blue you would expect to see on any other device. custom roms may or may not fix this, I never got the chance to root my device.Rear camera takes amazing photos, camera app is odd coming from cm11 and sense but is feature rich. I mistakingly never read the specs on the front camera and it turned out to be a horrible mistake. Front camera is 0.3 megapixels with no focus. unusable.Battery life is amazing! I have never had a phone that could keep up with my usage and not need three or four bateries swapped out during theday. This device literally lasted all day on a charge and asked for more.I would not recommend this device to anyone. There are plenty other devices out there that surpass the specs for this big of a screen. Feel free to comment or ask any questions."

"399505","Sony Xperia ZR C5502 Unlocked Phone--U.S. Warranty (Black)",4,"Out of the box, I was expecting less. Historically, I have used Motorola products. I'm coming from the Moto Droid Maxx which was a 2 year disappointment. Quality was a major expectation from Xperia, however, I did consider the price point for the phone.What I like: removable battery; customizable lock screen; quick access to camera from lock screen; customizable UI; out of the box plug and play support for t-mobile; 10 MBPS download on HPSA+ in NOVA/Washington DC area; solid feeling you would expect from Sony; integration with PS3 controller and other Sony products; good call quality; multiple keyboard layouts pre-installed; poor viewing angles make for privacy on a crowded subway;What I don't like: slower camera; LCD screen contrast (to be expected); no 4G LTE; proprietary USB cable requirements (to be expected as an experienced Sony User);When you take the galaxy S4 and do a side by side comparison, you will be blown away by the Samsung Screen. It will make the Sony's look out dated. However, you would be comparing a phone that costs $200 more. The Xperia is a great buy for the price. I am wanting a long term phone I wont have to replace. I expect over time this phone will last."
"399506","Sony Xperia ZR C5502 Unlocked Phone--U.S. Warranty (Black)",4,"Great build, fantastic camera, the phone battery lasts up to 3 days in stamina mode with light usage (calls + e-mails), plus waterproofing!Really liked Sony customizations on android.On cons side: - screen seems to have no antistatic coating so it attracts lot of dust. - loudspeaker is really weak with awful audio quality, my guess it's due to the waterproofing. - kinda plastic feel, it's all plastic, lacks ""substantial"" feel"

BUT, for everyday use, the feature is still good, at least you can happily wash it from time to time.another negative point for this device is: i can't find a hole to put though a hand ring then hold it. i think it also reflect that Sony doesn't expect you will swim when you hold it in water, or else most likely you would lost it soon.my last unhappiness is: they didn't release it in SG, so don't know where to replace the screen even i would like to pay."

I recommend carefully reading of Sony support forums, just search online for ""xperia zr wifi issue"" on your favorite search engine before buying this. You will find a LOT of complains.Note that my phone was never in contact with water or dropped, flashed or anything else.I recommend carefully reading of Sony support forums (search online for ""xperia zr wifi issue"" before buying this).Sadly Xperia Care is not supporting the warranty outside the U.S.[UPDATE] I managed to send it over to Sony, after explaining the issue several times, the unit was replaced for a new one.

It was tough finding a decent phone of medium size which is unlocked, this was definitely the best choice. I really like the layout and flexibility Sony has built in to their UI. There are a few things that are not preferable, but overall I can live with. It gets good reception and is quick. I am disappointed with the camera performance (my 3 year old Nexus S has much clearer pictures) and how the default album view is all one large album, versus the stock Android view which is separate albums. I do really appreciate the sd slot which allows me to add extra storage, as opposed being locked into only 16GB of the Nexus 4. FYI. Don't worry about the screen being old TFT technology, it's really clear with good viewing angles."

"399537","Sony Xperia ZR C5502 Unlocked Phone--U.S. Warranty (Pink)",4,"First, I may be a difficult customer when it comes to a smart phone. I tried the Z, it's battery life was poor, so I tried this. It was really good in most ways, but it seems to not pull the cellular signal as well as my trusty Motorola Defy or my Google Nexus 4. Apparently Tmobile's signal is lacking in my area (Annapolis, MD) so I really noticed the difference. My friends were wowed by the underwater video demonstration I gave them. The other issue I had with the phone was bluetooth issues with multiple devices, such as my Toyota Prius, Bose Soundlink, and Jabra headset. I was hoping they would release the new version of Android before my return window closed in case that would resolve those issues. Supposedly people in areas where the 4.2 operating system were released for it, or people who have rooted their phone and put on 4.3 have experienced an improvement in signal strengthl. If the issues were resolved, Sony would have earned my money. The phone is FAST and the picture is great. Can hardly tell the difference between this picture and the Z. Phone feels great in the hand. Battery life is excellent. I would like to see more products like this and would like Sony to get my money with this, but it needs a little refinement. Please keep up the development of these type phones."
"399538","Sony Xperia ZR C5502 Unlocked Phone--U.S. Warranty (Pink)",5,"Wow I love this phone. In addition to being an unlocked phone, there are like really small things that totally won me over. First off its waterproof... So I no longer need to worry about caging my phone during pool parties. 13 MP camera and really good audio & video quality.Now for the little things. Time based and event based profiling. Even though that is supposed to be built into JB I really am happy about how Sony Smart Connect works. Really great battery life and the Back light notif (The awesome blinking line at the bottom). The Sony interface is a nice refresh after using all the touchWiz products that Samsung had to offer. Absolute clarity in lecture recordings...and so on"
"399539","Sony Xperia ZR C5502 Unlocked Phone--U.S. Warranty (Pink)",5,"I lost my Note 2 to my swimming pool and didn't want to make the same mistake twice, so I purchased this phone to make sure water damage never claimed my phone again.I'm happy to report the phone functions more smoothly than the Samsung Note 2 & is far less glitchy.I kept wondering why the Note 2 had so many good reviews once I started using it because just before the Note 2 I had a iPhone 4s, obviously if you've used an iPhone, you'd naturally know the 4s functioned much better than the Note 2, well, the same does not apply to this phone.The Xperia in so many ways works just as well if not better than my phone just prior to the Note 2 (the 4s) - In fact it's likely the best functioning phone I've ever had.One thing I really really don't like about it is the face cam, it's awful. Yes, the regular camera is super high res, but if you're planning on taking a lot of instagram pics of yourself, you'll have to get good at doing it blind, because the face cam is pretty darn useless in low light & certainly isn't high res even in good lighting.If any new developments come up, I'll let you know."

"399550","Sony Xperia ZR C5502 Unlocked Phone--U.S. Warranty (Pink)",1,"Bluetooth and wifi HARDWARE problems out of the box. no fix for it, google it before purchasing! (pushing on the back case clips back in the component to make it temporarily work)This review is based on a four day experience with the phone on at&t, I am a power user so I had plenty of time to get frustrated with it.PROS: Great size, sd card slot, camera button, battery life, notification light/bar, water resistant (I would never try to claim water proof on an electronic device), great specs.CONS: EXTREMELY washed out and over saturated screen, bluetooth and wifi do not work on my particular device and is a common problem, 0.3 megapixel front facing camera (should have just excluded it as its useless), volume button location should be above power button.I will start out by saying I chose this phone because I only use phones that are able to be used one handed. This one stretches the capabilities of that over my preferred 4.3"" screens but the low bezel makes it easier then all the others. I have been waiting months for the z1 compact to come stateside and grew impatient and decided to try a similar phone to get used to the sony platform.Sony's ui is certainly not sense or touchwiz quality but it does provide some beautiful icons and apps but is missing alot of features.The screen on this device is horrible, facebook, snapchat, instagram, youtube apps looks oddly colored due to this. Very over saturated and washed out. facebook is purple compared to the normal blue you would expect to see on any other device. custom roms may or may not fix this, I never got the chance to root my device.Rear camera takes amazing photos, camera app is odd coming from cm11 and sense but is feature rich. I mistakingly never read the specs on the front camera and it turned out to be a horrible mistake. Front camera is 0.3 megapixels with no focus. unusable.Battery life is amazing! I have never had a phone that could keep up with my usage and not need three or four bateries swapped out during theday. This device literally lasted all day on a charge and asked for more.I would not recommend this device to anyone. There are plenty other devices out there that surpass the specs for this big of a screen. Feel free to comment or ask any questions."

"399555","Sony Xperia ZR C5502 Unlocked Phone--U.S. Warranty (Pink)",4,"Out of the box, I was expecting less. Historically, I have used Motorola products. I'm coming from the Moto Droid Maxx which was a 2 year disappointment. Quality was a major expectation from Xperia, however, I did consider the price point for the phone.What I like: removable battery; customizable lock screen; quick access to camera from lock screen; customizable UI; out of the box plug and play support for t-mobile; 10 MBPS download on HPSA+ in NOVA/Washington DC area; solid feeling you would expect from Sony; integration with PS3 controller and other Sony products; good call quality; multiple keyboard layouts pre-installed; poor viewing angles make for privacy on a crowded subway;What I don't like: slower camera; LCD screen contrast (to be expected); no 4G LTE; proprietary USB cable requirements (to be expected as an experienced Sony User);When you take the galaxy S4 and do a side by side comparison, you will be blown away by the Samsung Screen. It will make the Sony's look out dated. However, you would be comparing a phone that costs $200 more. The Xperia is a great buy for the price. I am wanting a long term phone I wont have to replace. I expect over time this phone will last."
"399556","Sony Xperia ZR C5502 Unlocked Phone--U.S. Warranty (Pink)",4,"Great build, fantastic camera, the phone battery lasts up to 3 days in stamina mode with light usage (calls + e-mails), plus waterproofing!Really liked Sony customizations on android.On cons side: - screen seems to have no antistatic coating so it attracts lot of dust. - loudspeaker is really weak with awful audio quality, my guess it's due to the waterproofing. - kinda plastic feel, it's all plastic, lacks ""substantial"" feel"

"399568","Sony Xperia ZR C5502 Unlocked Phone--U.S. Warranty (Pink)",5,"This phone was surprisingly awesome. I researched it and read lots of great things. I expected the phone to let me down but it met all expectations and even surpassed some. It has great features. I love the face recognition security feature, even though it can be tricked. The indicator light is a bar at the bottom, below the screen. The light can be customized with different colors if you download an app. The picture is great. My hands are small so the size of the phone is perfect. I have tested the phones water resistance and it keeps its promise. It was in the river and my iPhone was killed but the Sony was ok, just muddy. I had no problems with the microphone afterward, as some say they do. It was a great feeling rinsing it off later. If I was going to complain, It would be that after using other phones, I wished it had soft buttons and a hard home button below the viewing screen. The buttons appear at the bottom of the screen, or on the side if in landscape, and use part of the viewing area. But the way its done is good. I expected it to feel cheap because they call it the Mid-range version of the z series. I have bought the c5502 and it has H+ and 3G but does not have 4G LTE. I think the c5503 has 4G. I bought this version understanding that because it is compatible with AT&T and T-Mobile. I wanted flexibility and options with my service providers. I use this phone with straight talk on the AT&T network and it works fantastic in my area. The processes run smooth and quick. This phone received an updated to 4.4.2 and did experience battery drain, but it seems to be fine now after some other apps have had updates. I'm hoping Sony will give it another update before it is too old. The Sony preloaded apps are more useful than bloatware that came with my Samsung Galaxy S3. I was a little disappointed you cant scroll through the home screens seamlessly, once you scroll to the last one it requires you to return the other way. The phone allows a microSD for extra memory but it will not allow you to transfer apps to the card. I'm hoping another update will change that. The phone has plenty of memory for my apps, but I would like the option for more."

"399577","Sony Xperia ZR C5502 Unlocked Phone--U.S. Warranty (Pink)",1,"wont buy similar things again, don't take such so call waterproof or water resistant too seriously.i like and have quite a few sony products, when i lost my previous phone to water i selected this zr as replacement, what it attracted me most is the up to IP58 level of waterproof ability, and a physical camer shoot button which make under water photo easier, the under water video captured by zr on youtube encouraged me much to make the choice. another thing i like is zr's easy-to-replace battery.so even though Sony didn't release this model in Singapore, i still order it when i traveled to US. i did like it at the first glance when it arrived at my hand, hand feel was good, strong cpu and ample ram let apps run smoothly, anytime it need a clean i just put it under water tap and washed to shine.but waterproof finally proved not so strong. last month i had my vacation at Thailand to found i don't have the lucky to take underwater photo or video as shown on net. i brought it to snorkeling, tide it up and wrap it on my hand, confirm all the caps were locked then went into the sea, several minutes later the screen was off but long pressing the shot button could not wake it up, i went up to check and confirm it worked then back to water again, still the same. so i went up to boat again and turn it off, left it there. totally my zr was in water no more than 15 minutes. when i finished snorkeling and came back to boat, i found the start up image was distorted, so i immediately dismount the battery. later when i return back to hotel and check again, the screen show only color lines.what's wrong? on boat i had checked the back cover, no water run into the battery cabin, which is protected by an orange rubber circle, the battery was safe and now i can still mount it to and power on the phone. the fatal issue was seen when i put it under light, under the screen, there was one long water mark run from one corner to the opposite one, but the phone itself looks okay, no marks, no dent around the screen.another thing i want to mention is, i once read zr is strengthen to make it last longer in swimming pool and sea water, but my zr's back cover now looks very bad, thought i didn't wash it after that day, i never expect it would like that.here i try to give a reason: i suspect the data that zr can stay under 1.5 meter depth water for 30 minutes, was a test result in static water, while snorkeling, i wont dive into the water or else wather will run into my mouth, and my hand cannot be 1.5 meter long that would be too odd. but the water still can run into the screen because when i stroke the water, my handphone also moved, so there was some pressure on the side that push the water, while on the other side the pressure was less, the pressure difference might be big enough to drive water run into the first side till the other end. so my conclusion is, these so called waterproof hand phones are not so practical for underwater photo, you better not move fast, or you better put it in a watertight bag but that would make your choice of such device meaningless. BUT, for everyday use, the feature is still good, at least you can happily wash it from time to time.another negative point for this device is: i can't find a hole to put though a hand ring then hold it. i think it also reflect that Sony doesn't expect you will swim when you hold it in water, or else most likely you would lost it soon.my last unhappiness is: they didn't release it in SG, so don't know where to replace the screen even i would like to pay."
"399578","Sony Xperia ZR C5502 Unlocked Phone--U.S. Warranty (Pink)",1,"Completely dissapointed with the phone. It suddenly ran off after only 5 months. Bluetooth did not work since the beggining, mobile data stopped working after a few months too. And about a week ago it started to shut down restart by its own. I contacted Sony and Galactics, but none of them gives me a solution. I wasted $300."
"399579","Sony Xperia ZR C5502 Unlocked Phone--U.S. Warranty (Pink)",1,"The phone is great. But Sony customer service is awful. I sent my phone to get fix under warranty, or at least they promised me to let me know if it s still covered or not, or if there would be any charge they promised me to let me know. I sent the phone with Fedex. I got signature of their employee. But after 3 months no one gave me straight answer. They promised me to call back or email back, but they just lied. Until today I have not clue what is going on with my phone, and I lost my 400 dollars phone.My bank, Chase called them, and they lied to my bank. Said there is no Xperia ZR under my RMA.

The sound quality is so much better than my previous phone (LG G2) granted, that phone didn't have great sound anyway.I bought some fingerprint resistant tempered glass front and back protectors for a few reasons. 1) glass scratches easily, even if it is 9h so I would rather scratch a $10-$15 protector that the device itself.Came with - Charger cable (UK with US adapter included.) mini-USB to USB for playstation controller connection and a few plastic protectors which I used until I got my glass ones."

It was eventually sent to Sony's Customer Service in the United States.Because it is one of the few remaining companies that still don't put into place a worldwide warranty, it is excruciatingly annoying because if you're living in another country both will try to refuse to make it valid. One will argue that you need to have made the purchase in the country of origin to make it valid while the other one says that because the IMEI is registered elsewhere then it should be fixed there. The one in the U.S. eventually relented and I am currently waiting to test it out once more.*While I feel that the cellphone is top notch (I could easily give it 4 stars hands down), problems like the latter have a significant impact on my perception. I believe you're better off with another product merely on the basis of quality of build as well as customer service.*Note: Slightly unrelated but with regards to the customer service. I ended up paying for packaging fees for sending my cellphone to the U.S. and I also have to pay for import taxes (I currently reside in the U.K., used to be in Mexico) as well as a shipping fee because they don't send it themselves from the U.S. (I had a friend do the favor for me).

I do a good bit of camping / hiking so battery life is very important and waterproof (without being in a bag) is a definite plus. The phone has several power saving options that maximize battery life depending on your needs. When hiking I don't care about data and the phone has a mode that turns off all data and background processes where it only sends and receives calls and texts. Battery will last for couple of days in that mode.My wife has an iPhone 6 and recently we recently spent several days in theme parks in Orlando. With very similar usage at the end of the day her phone was virtually dead. I would still be around 70% battery left. WOW!There are a few downsides:1. The phone is very thin and with the screen going all the way to the edge it makes is somewhat difficult (and uncomfortable) to hold when using the screen.2. The phone is glass on both sides. That makes it very slippery. Be careful when putting is on a smooth surface. It will slide off easily.3. The phone is waterproof but the screen does not work too well when wet. For taking pictures you can use the camera button but otherwise the touchscreen is virtually unusable in the water.

I took the phone off the charger Sunday morning at 7am, The battery on this device is insane. I haven't owned a phone since a flip phone that lasted this long. Absolutely beautiful screen (get the coolreal tempered glass screen protectors front and back so you can show off how great looking this phone is), fast, great features. All the cool apps for the camera (which takes the best pictures I've ever seen from any phone). Literally the only thing I don't like is its only 16GB, yes you can add an SD card but not all apps move. Every feature on this phone works better than advertised. My brother-in-law works for AT&T and has all the new Samsung phones and was blown away by this phone. It is noticeably faster than an S6, whether it clocks faster on benchmarks I don't know, but he even noticed it running smoother and quicker. The built in apps are great, and being unlocked I can get rid of whatever I don't want. I'm a convert now and will NEVER EVER buy a carrier locked phone again. And if you have a PS4 the streaming on it works flawlessly! If you're an AT&T customer this is the one to get the other models do not have all the 4G LTE bands in them."

"399596","Sony Z3 LTE - Unlocked (Copper)",5,"Great device, I was on the fence about purchasing the Z3 because of the phones that were going to be announced at MWC, but figure that in the worst case scenario I could return it. Boy am I glad I didn't wait, the announced phones by HTC and Samsung didn't have anything to grab my interest. Curved screen gimmicks and iPhone 6 ripoffs from Samsung, and HTC just rerelased the same phone they did last year with a higher megapixel camera; one that's just as bad as before. To top it off they all have the same specs which were only slightly better than the Z3 (and as someone who constantly heard ""why do you need a 64bit processor when your phone don't have 4 gig ram lol"" when he had an iPhone 6, it's funny to see android manufacturers pushing them now on phones that still have less than 4gigs of ram)Overall the Z3 has been the best Android phone I ever owned, faster than the m8 I owned before it, same high quality build as the m8 and IPhone, with a camera that can best both in the right hands. The waterproofing is just the icing one the cake. I used to be a fan of Sony Ericsson back in the feature phone days but stop being a fan of them once they start to put out less than great smartphones, but the Z3 has won me back. I still prefer IOS to android, but I am waiting to see if lollipop can win me over when Sony pushes it out."

I took the phone off the charger Sunday morning at 7am, The battery on this device is insane. I haven't owned a phone since a flip phone that lasted this long. Absolutely beautiful screen (get the coolreal tempered glass screen protectors front and back so you can show off how great looking this phone is), fast, great features. All the cool apps for the camera (which takes the best pictures I've ever seen from any phone). Literally the only thing I don't like is its only 16GB, yes you can add an SD card but not all apps move. Every feature on this phone works better than advertised. My brother-in-law works for AT&T and has all the new Samsung phones and was blown away by this phone. It is noticeably faster than an S6, whether it clocks faster on benchmarks I don't know, but he even noticed it running smoother and quicker. The built in apps are great, and being unlocked I can get rid of whatever I don't want. I'm a convert now and will NEVER EVER buy a carrier locked phone again. And if you have a PS4 the streaming on it works flawlessly! If you're an AT&T customer this is the one to get the other models do not have all the 4G LTE bands in them."

Boy am I glad I didn't wait, the announced phones by HTC and Samsung didn't have anything to grab my interest. Curved screen gimmicks and iPhone 6 ripoffs from Samsung, and HTC just rerelased the same phone they did last year with a higher megapixel camera; one that's just as bad as before. To top it off they all have the same specs which were only slightly better than the Z3 (and as someone who constantly heard ""why do you need a 64bit processor when your phone don't have 4 gig ram lol"" when he had an iPhone 6, it's funny to see android manufacturers pushing them now on phones that still have less than 4gigs of ram)Overall the Z3 has been the best Android phone I ever owned, faster than the m8 I owned before it, same high quality build as the m8 and IPhone, with a camera that can best both in the right hands. The waterproofing is just the icing one the cake. I used to be a fan of Sony Ericsson back in the feature phone days but stop being a fan of them once they start to put out less than great smartphones, but the Z3 has won me back. I still prefer IOS to android, but I am waiting to see if lollipop can win me over when Sony pushes it out."
