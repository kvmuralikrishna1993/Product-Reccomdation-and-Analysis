"1719","I really like the phone but unfortunately my tmobile sim does not fit on it. Too bad I have to return it."
"1720","Love it, it's fast slim, and very sleek. The only down side is that it's slippery."
"1721","this product must be defective i plugged i in to charge and thought it was gonna caught fire. returned it immediately still waiting on my refund"
"1722","I am very happy with my cell phone. Beautiful and friendly"
"1723","We've had this phone for 3 months or so, and it just decided to completely quit working. In the middle of the day, it shut off and now refuses to turn back on (the battery was at 60%).Aside from the fact that it no longer works, we were having trouble with various aspects of the phone. It would constantly switch networks in the middle of calls and then hang up on the person you're talking to. Additionally, the battery life *might* be good for 12 hours, and the GPS does not work---it updates two or three miles after you've missed the turn."
"1724","Update: the phone has been under repair by sony for 6 weeks, ""waiting for parts"" with no information on when it will be sent back. That makes nearly 3 months of repair time in 7 months of ownership. This phone has gone back twice, and my daughter's Z3 Compact has gone back once for the side charge port coming off, and been fixed a second time by me for the same issue, along with a new back, which spontaneously shattered while sitting on a car seat about 1 week after the warranty expired.Well, I bought this phone for $200. But it is really a $400 phone since you have to buy 2 of them. One to use, and one to send back for repair. Actually a fine phone when it works. First phone had the screen fail after a few months, now replacement has the microphone and earpiece fail a few month later. A smart phone kinda needs a screen and a microphone and speaker. Like I say, just buy 2."
"1725","Not the best quality. Doesn't really protect the cell phone, just by scratches."
"1726","I have had overheating and shut off issues ever since I purchased this phone, but I sucked it up. In December a software update prevented the phone from restarting continually when it overheated. However, it still, overheated. In March the phone died. It Refused to charge it just gave up the ghost. I sent it to Sony for repair and one month later still no phone. It is impossible to speak with anyone at the repair center and the customer service is equally hopeless. My advice is to keep your money. If you are ever unfortunate enough to need a repair you will be on your own."
"1727","Here is why. It arrived, I charged it, got it to the store and activated my sim for it with my plan, the problem with this phone is it constantly restarts. I've tried several things and no luck. Every time it updates an app or downloads something, it restarts. Your in the middle of doing something, it freezes for about 5 seconds... then restarts. It sits there and I'm not even using it, you guessed it, restarts. Also it gets hot, even after 1 minute of use. That is very irregular. I finally gave up after the third time it went unresponsive and black screen. Last night it ""stayed on"" somehow with a black screen and overheated. The battery was depleted when I woke and it was very hot. DO NOT GET THIS PHONE."
"1728","So I've always been bad lucky with Blackberry and Blu. My first time owning a Sony Phone. Was super amazed that it was water proof. Threw it in water last night for couple minutes and its still up and running. Can't go wrong with this phone. Its cheap plus have amazing specs. My only wish is that I got the dual SIM version."
"1729","very good"
"1730","Really a junky phone. Have only had 4 months now, and cannot hear a phone conversation unless I have it on speaker phone. Also constantly loses the 4g connection, I have to restart the phone so it will connect."
"1731","Great"
"1732","Worst cell phone ever, not reliable. It just heat itself and turn it off for several hours until the battery is drained. Not recommended at all, returning it to amazon."
"1733","I am writing to you to report the problem has been happening with my Smartphone Sony Xperia M4 Aqua , which since last January I have given use, it turns out that the problem started slightly from about 2 months turned off and lit , passing day the fault was increasing as the image on the screen froze , then think of a distortion of colors and shapes, he turned it off and had to resort to forced restart.The phone will have been two factory reset , and does not have different applications bringing (except for Whatsapp ) and currently does not work, start logo Xperia then Android , distortion of colors and shapes occurs on the screen and is off and so is every cycle ."
"1734","I received the cellphone in January 2016 because im from Venezuela. Its was a gift for my girlfriend and the last month was her birthday. The cellphone does not charge, the green led is off even when the charger is conected. I tried with differents chargers, computer conection, differents cables, press the reset button for 15 seg 30 seg 1 min 5 min. Press the vol+ and power button, vol- and power buttom, press the power buttom for 5 min, all kind o recommendations from sony.com and nothing. The cellphone does not start. I want to know what i can do about it. Thank you for your time."
"1735","I've been having some problems with the phone. I've tried to get a hold of the warranty that it came with and they said to just master reset my phone. I like the phone its just giving me a lot of technical problems."
"1736","*Update after 5 months*Loud speakers blew out.I'm pretty sure it's from being caught in heavy rain a couple weeks ago.Buy this POS at your own risk.It's cheaper right now so it could be worth the money.I've had this phone for a couple months now. I really haven't had a problem with it. The screen can get pretty warm at times but it hasn't overheated. The camera is really nice just not great in horrible lighting and the battery life can drain pretty quickly depending on the activity, but that's fine lol my only real gripe is that there aren't any good (protective) cases for it."
"1737","The phone itself is not bad, but the customer service from Sony is awful. After a few months of using the phone, the ear piece in the phone stopped working, I called sony and explained the problem, it still worked on speaker, and with the handsfree set in, but not when holding the earpiece to my ear. They insisted it could be a software glitch and had me reset the phone..... twice, which did not work.So I had to send it in for repair, and this is where the fun starts. Having been told it would take about 14 business days to fix and send my phone back, I am currently still waiting and we are on business day 28. To this point, after 4 phone calls, and 3 emails (because one representative actually told me that they didn't have a way to call people at the facility where the repairs take place, true story!), still no-one can tell me when the phone might be fixed.With that in mind, I asked for a replacement phone the last time I contacted them, I felt that was not unreasonable as they were well past their own schedule for repairing and returning my device, and clearly could not give any clue as to when it might be done. They simply ignored that request and said that my phone would be repaired and sent back when they got the parts in. This could be in 6 days, or 6 months.I would not by this product and would recommend people avoid sony products if this is what happens when the slightest thing goes wrong. The support (or lack thereof) is appalling for a company of their size and standing, and it could be a simple fix, if they would just replace a device when they are having so much trouble finding the part they need for it. Instead they are leaving a paying customer hanging, with no recourse, and without the phone paid for."
"1738","I bought this one. However It was not work. So, I returned this item, however my credit card was charged again by seller's mistake. DO NOT BUY THIS s***"
"1739","Perfect . Amazing phone for that price . I recommended a lot"
"1740","Received this product very quickly after purchase (I ordered it monday and got it on friday). So i really liked that. It was a new phone, the color on the box was not the color of the phone, which i didn't mind at all. (The box showed a white phone, though i had ordered a black one) Turned it on and works beautifully right now.Price: not terrible for this phone, so all around I am happy with my purchase"
"1741","Do not buy this product. I hate it. This is my first comment. I used this to take some photos. However, the photos can not be saved to the phone."
"1742","I HAVE ORDERED MY PHONE AND RECEIVED IT, WHEN I TRIED SWITCHING ON IT DIDNT ON AND I TRIED PUTTING CHARGING BUT STILL ITS NOT ON,TRYING TO CALL CUSTOMER SERVICE WILL SEE WHATS THERE RESPONCE ??"
"1743","Not sure yet"
"1744","This phone though a nice slick phone has a serious heating problem at the back. Even through a hard case its still warm to the touch. Sony needs to get this temperature thing right?"
"1745","A very sturdy phone, little bit slushy at times, but makes my teen-aged son happy-happy. Heats up soon with few apps/games running (and especially if you have a protective case). As an ardent Sony fan, the price and the quality of this phone is good. Would have given 4+ if not for the sluggish and heat factor. Best suitable for an early teen with minimal usage (and as expected gaming usage)."
"1746","Had for about a week, with no complains. The only problem I've noticed is a typical heat increase when gaming, and the YouTube isn't the best (takes a while to load videos)"
"1747","Love it"
"1748","I wanted to like this, but it has too many problems to keep. It's a great size, lightweight and waterproof. However, the battery life on it is horrible when playing games, it drops > 10% in half an hour. Like many other users have mentioned it gets really hot. Games like Bubble Witch crash or lock up when playing for more than 15 minutes."
"1749","Great device"
"1750","excellent cellphone just a bit overheat when using it full"
"1751","This is Ok mobile, worth for the price. But as many reviews said it has heating problem, On start when all applications starts- Mobile gets heated very quickly. But Good part is over the time in a minute or 2 it gets cool down.Heating problem is probably because of its Water proof feature. Since all body is air tight, very space for air ventilation inside."
"1752","I've been a Sony user my whole life and I'm usually pretty pleased with them. Sony phones are super user friendly and I usually just like the overall quality of their phones, but this phone is a game changer! I feel like this is the most luxurious phone I've ever held! I take lots of pictures so the first thing I played with was the camera, and I started to get worried because I read reviews it wasn't that great, but I think its wonderful. It does very well in low light and it seems to fit more into the picture, it also has cute editing settings for those who like to play with pics. It set up very quickly and I was able to update and download all my old apps that I liked in a reasonable amount of time. I heard phone calls were quiet but I made a few phone calls and played with ringtones and they seemed loud enough to me, the dimmest brightness setting is still very bright, and I was able to send and receive mms very quickly which is something I've found to be on the slower side with Sony phones. I have yet to test just how waterproof the phone is but based on videos and other reviews I've read I'm betting it'll hold up through anything I could/would ever put it through. The phone took just under 2 hours to fully charge and it actually does last 2 days! I put it through at least 12 hours of internet streaming and made phone calls and texts before needing to charge it again at the end of the second day, also I had like 12 apps running at once before I decided to close them all and you'd never even know all those apps were running it was so fast! I definitely recommend this phone to anyone looking into it."
"1753","A good phone."
"1754","Very good phone! Even though the camera was broken so i returned it! And bought another one from other brand! Anyway the phone is very fast and has a good size like the xperia z3! I love the fact that is waterproof even though i could never experienced it. I would recommend is you are looking for a budget phone this one will work just fine"
"1755","I love it"
"1756","Great product."
"1757","A good phone!"
"1758","Slow Phone! Looks good, takes good pictures but its slow and the Phone interface SUCKS big time. I am new to android but I ordered a LG G3 for my wife after i ordered this for myself. Gotta say the LG G3 is WAY BETTER than this and also is 32 GB for $20 more!Sony really failed with their Phone interface on this phone, even though it s a smart phone most people still use it to MAKE CALLS, please keeep that in mind SONY and make sure you have a user friendly phone interface on all your phones."
"1759","Very good phone so far. I'm delighted with it."
"1760","i love this phone, first one they sent me wasnt working, told them, they changed it, and the new one is working perfectly, runs fast enough for me, great camera, lightweight, not to big-not too small"
"1761","Only had the phone a day so keep that in mind when reading this review....My last phone was the Nexus 4. I had it just under 3 years. Great phone. Its lack of LTE bands and limited space (16GB with no SD card) was a problem. Other than that I'd still have the phone. I have no interest in paying the premium for a flagship phone as midrange phones are plenty for my needs. I tried a couple different refurbished phones but each on had problems...I assume because they were used/refurbished. So I knew I had to go with a new phone. I did get the invite for the OnePlus X but canceled my order when I decided that it lack too many LTE bands to be as useful as it could be in the US (really band 4 was the only option). I was thinking about getting a Z3 but even used ones were still way too expensive IMO. So I saw this one.I knew when I ordered it that it was not a flagship phone. It has a 13megapixal camera which is not flagship quality but...its not a flagship. The battery is only 2400+ which is low compared to flagship but...its not a flagship phone. CPU...not flagship quality but... you know.Its not a flagship phone but it is also 1/3 the price of a flagship phone. It offers all the gsm LTE bands you could want (for the US). Its thin. The battery isn't 2 days as Sony says but in the 1 day I've had it I've been impressed (Nexus 4 was smaller battery so this better). Camera is only 13megapixal but its better than the 8megapixal I was use to. Its practically stock android (something I am use to).On a personal note: I like the design of the phone. I never liked the rounded back you get on many phones now a days. I like when my lays on a table that it doesn't rock when you click on the screen. I like the relatively squared corners of the M4. It gives the illusion of a good phone to screen size ratio. I completely understand others might not share these opinions. Its just my preference.For the money its a good phone. For now I'll give it 5 stars as my limited experience has been nothing but great.While I appreciate what flagship phones give you (my Nexus 4 was a flagship phone in its time) and I could afford it if I wanted but what you get for the cost just doesn't out weigh a number of mid-range phones priced in the $~200 range.Edit #1 (1 week):Absolutely no complaints. Its a beautiful phone..especially in its price range. The battery has been absolutely fantastic for my use. I am confident I could get almost 2 days on my normal use. My more significant use (when my son gets his hands on it) does drain the battery faster but I can still get over a day with it. This is the first phone I've had where I know I do not have to plug it in during the day and can probably skip charging every night.Edit #2 (2 months):Fantastic phone. For the money I am shocked how good it is. It is only running Lollipop but I can only assume that the Sony customization to the OS has added something to improve battery life (like what Marshmallow gives you today). When I am at work I probably listen to music (from the SD card) for about 4-5 hours a day. Add in a little internet usage throughout the day and I still have ~60% battery life by the end of the day. As I said before when pushed the phone can drain quickly (son playing lots of games or watching YouTube videos) but for my normal usage this is quite nice for me. My Nexus 4 would not make to the end of my work day without needing to be plugged in if I did the same thing (music and some internet browsing).The camera is? Well the camera itself is quite nice. But the Sony camera software isn't quite right. Its slow. The Android camera app is a definite improvement. So I am not going to change my 5 star review for a slow camera app (that would be silly).I did find one problem though: I had paired my phone with my car (Honda Fit). Everything was working fine for days/weeks. Then one day I realized the car was not informing me of text messages from my phone. Seems the phone had some sort of issue with bluetooth and its saved pairing with the car seemed broken. I had to delete the pairing my phone and car had and recreate the pairing. Its been fine since then. Not sure what happened or what caused the issue but all seems fine now. I suppose if I could do 4.5 stars I'd consider lowering my review but since I cannot I am sticking with 5 as I think it is better that 4 stars. Plus....its possible my car was the problem and not the phone (but I did not have this problem with my previous phone).Anyways....love the phone."
"1762","Great phone. Used it for about a month and have no problems. Battery lasts all day even with high usage. Only have 1 app that won't work because the company only has it available for IPhone or Samsung. Just had to get a different SIM card from my service provider to get started."
"1763","Nice looking phone, but Sony sucks. Their quality control is completely ridiculous and constantly send out defective phones. The mic will work 2/5 times on this phone even while doing the diagnostic test."
"1764","I got this phone to replace a broken LG G4 and I have to say it's a decent mid-range phone.Pros: Waterproof Sleek design Decent headset audio and speaker volumeOverall decent performance. Excellent battery life with stamina mode on, even with LTE. I got nearly four hours screen on time.2GB RAM is enough for multitasking.Seamlessly transitions from LTE to 3G to 2G depending on coverage area. Downloads are super quick on LTE (Panama's 10x10Mhz 700Mhz Band 28 LTE went as fast as 50mbps/20mbps dl/ul) Micro SD card support up to 128GB.Bootloader can be officially unlocked and there is a small custom ROM community on xdaCons: Can get laggy with games. Display is not as good as the Z3 seriesCamera quality is so-soGets a bit hot with extended use though it cools quickly.No double tap to wake like on the Z3 series.Comes with useless bloatware installed,luckily some of it can be eliminated.Overall. I'm happy with it for now."
"1765","As always Sony is ahead of the pack of phones I have ever owned. I had several Sony's in a row and due to budget and carrier restraints I had a Windows phone for 6 months. Well I am back and while it is not the newest and best Sony offers it is by far more amazing than other phones I have tried from friends and relatives.The specs may be lower but it is to be expected from a mid-range phone after all. Honestly for me it is on par with the high range phones I had previously from Sony's Xperia line.If you are tired of waiting for the latest and greatest from one particular company who shall remain nameless, BUY A SONY AND GET MANY OF THOSE FUNCTIONS NOW RATHER THAN WAIT 1-3 YEARS FOR THEM TO CATCH UP.Yes, there is a heating issue with the phone, but logic just tells you if it is heating up too much it is time to put the phone down and get back to life.As for apps all my old favorites load perfectly well and several I was waiting to try are beyond amazing on this phone. Something I definitely could not say for my few apps on my Lumia phone prior to this.Essentially if you are looking for an amazing phone that will provide you with all the features and apps you need and have become used to having on Android, pick up this phone and support SONY as they have truly innovative products on the market.The SONY XPERIA line of phones is definitely worth the money and buying UNLOCKED from Amazon mean no excess carrier bloatware that slows the phone and makes any amazing phone seem to be a letdown."
"1766","I have had the phone for a couple of weeks. Got it on a pre-black Friday sale for $199. For the price-point, it is a pretty good phone. The processor is pretty quick and it has 16GB memory with the capability of adding a microSD to expand an additional 128GB. I have a 32GB card in mine. It can free up space by transferring apps and files to the microSD with a touch of a button. That is a nice feature that my LG did not have. It also has the auto-screen brightness adjustment which isn't always offered in phones at this price-point. I have had a bit of a learning curve switching to Sony from LG, but it hasn't been too bad. My apps didn't all load automatically when I logged on with my Google account, which was a bit of a pain. (And one app was no longer available, so I lost that one entirely.) I haven't tried the headphones, but the Bluetooth works fine with my car stereo. The camera has all kinds of special features that I will most likely never use (like adding an animated dinosaur to your pictures). It seems like a pretty decent camera so far. Calling and texting work well. I did have to manually enter my APN settings for Net10, but that was simple enough. My daughter ended up getting one of these phones as well."
"1767","Phone instantly started overheating as soon as I turned it on and began to set it up. Horrible."
"1768","The phone works fine but wont hold charge the battery drain very fast, I fully charged night before in the morning the battery only has%30 .it has also over heat problem."
"1769","Excelent price, excelent hardware and price... great phone...."
"1770","i was very happy to purchase this phone was really fast shipping thanks to amazon butt very disappointed after i receive camera failure afer 2 pictures and going very very hot top back of the phone see picture i was big fan of sony butt very disappointed with this product I'm going to returning thanks as amazon costumer"
"1771","Heats up like hell. Cant hold to the face. This is the behavior right out the box. Wished had opened it sooner to send back. (Sigh)"
"1772","Over heating and restarts on it own several time in a day. I bought this afyer my experience with z3. As a second for my house hold use. Cobtiuesly having issues of restart regardless of uninstalling lot of apps and running with n dafe mode for a while. I always think Sony is good because t thisnone failed. May be next time I should think or wait till get a good review on new phones."
"1773","Good design but it slow compared for the price range"
"1774","The Phone turns off everytime i don't use it... And the unic way to turns it on is pressing the emergency ""off"" button... I think this product was broken because that price... I want a refund of my money."
"1775","Great phone"
"1776","My son loves this phone. It is fast enough to handle games and daily tasks. The screen is clear and responsive. I can't attest to the water resiliency as he bought a case for it to protect it. I highly recommend. It worked great with the Straight Talk Sim card I purchased here on Amazon for a discount."
"1777","awesome phone"
"1778","MIC/SPEAKER STOPPED WORKING 2 WEEKS AFTER THE 30 DAY REFUND/RETURN PERIOD!!!!"
"1779","Great!"
"1780","phone is very sleek and attractive. very light in the hands.. set up was a cakewalk.. android 5.0 preinstalled. pretty quick response time .. overall impressed with this phone. has gotten a little warm with heavy use but nothing extreme like noted in some of the other reviews, completely happy with my choice.. my last phone was a galaxy s4 active. so to still be impressed.. it says alot. i would so make the same decision again"
"1781","very good"
"1782","Love it. It's awesome for a $200 phone! It is waterproof. It works with any network that uses Sim cards. It does get warm when the processor gets going like other reviews state, doesn't affect operation. Camera is okay. The warranty is badass. The screen cracked and they replaced it immediately."
"1783","The phone itself is OK. It heats up too quickly. The worst part is Sony's Xperia Protection which rendered my phone useless and bricked it. If you purchase this phone don't use this feature."
"1784","Very good!"
"1785","Unfortunately this phoneis giving me tons of errors since the beggining, now the camera is not working, the has never been dropped I wrote to Sony looking for an answer but they didn't reply, I bought this phone on December 2015. I feel ripped off!"
"1786","You get what you pay for has some issues bit price was right"
"1787","Love this phone for my daughter"
"1788","Excelent price. It's a good Android Phone, not the top but good enough."
"1789","MY husband loves it"
"1790","All time is super heated, sometimes does not turn, I have to reset it, and rear camera does not work, shows Error"
"1791","I recently bought this cell phone, it was supposed to come unlocked, but no, this completely blocked. The google account is blocked surely with another person's password, Please I need HELP!!!"
"1792","I bought this product on january 2016 as new. I had an issue with my Sony Xperia M4 recently. I dropped it in water however it said that it is waterproof it is not working anymore. So I went to a Sony technical service and they opened it, then they realized that the cellphone was not new.I feel that I was swindled, because I paid for a new product but instead I got one refurbished one."
"1793","This is a review on both the product and Sony's service. Four months after I bought it the screen was having issues. A vertical band of dead pixels on the right side of the screen. Sony received the RMA shipment on May 25th. Their service terms claim a 15 business day turnaround time. Till date they have not been able to tell me when I would receive the repaired phone. Calls and chats with customer service department end with -- "" we don't have any information at this time. Contact us next week..."". I would have been better off returning the phone to Amazon."
"1794","Just as expected, a good phone with good specs and great durability. It's been used everyyday in a professional kitchen setup, subject to splashes, fat and heat without a glitch"
"1795","good price for smartphones. gave this phone for my in laws, she is using it everyday."
"1796","Don't know if it's the phone it self or if the seller got a bad batch to sell but this phone is absolute worst,from it not being waterproof to the battery getting ridiculously hot to it not even charging the way it should anymore and all of these problems are only after a couple of months of use"
"1797","don't buy. this phone suffer from Sudden death and the Sony support its the worst.No lo compre se apaga y no vuelve a prender el servicio de sony apesta es el peor te mandan de un lado a otro."
"1798","nice phone, recommended"
"1799","I've tried Samsung, HTC, Motorola and this Sony is by far the most superior phone I've ever had. This model is mid range ,I can't imagin what a top of the line Sony would be like.Xperia fan for life"
"1800","Great phone - except battery life is awful. Phone, hardware and operations is, in my opinion, great so much that I continue to use this phone despite its short battery life. and for the price I paid (amazon holiday sale $150) I cant complain a bit"
"1801","This worked great when I first got it but after a few months I started getting problems with the speaker and charging port. I will not be buying this again."
"1802","Excellent phone. Probably the best phone I ""ve ever have for this kind of money...."
"1803","This is my third Sony phone in 15 years. Couldn’t be happier. Lot of my friends like this phone more than their iPhone. What else can I say."
"1804","nice!"
"1805","I bought this when my Xperia z3 for TMobile screen broke for the third time. Figured I'd just buy a new phone. Didn't want to buy a current gen for $700 so I figured this next-up gen would be better. All I really want in a phone was that it was water proof(resistant now) and had a good battery. The z3 fit that bill easily so I thought the m4 would too. Everything about this m4 is less responsive than the z3. Touchscreen feels different/less responsive and apps loading/switching is less responsive. But hey, for the price it's not bad and it definitely fits what I'm looking for. Battery lasts forever on moderate usage and dunking it isn't a problem. Just wish it was better than the last generation."
"1806","Worst phone ever had in life. Speakers are not working. Really waste for money. Is this possible to exchange the phone by any chance. Please advise"
"1807","Can't go wrong for the price. Good phone. VERY waterproof."
"1808","The Battery dies quickly, and takes ages to charge, more than 12 hours for a full charge. The microphone stopped working after 2 months of purchase. The speaker is the worst, you can barely listen at people The camera takes horrible pictures and using the flash you only see big giant white stains"
"1809","I am very satisfied, I exceeded my expectations, excellent cost-benefit."
"1810","phone is great except that the camera doesn't work with several third party apps. Of course, neither Sony nor the app developers have been helpful. I suspect it has to do with support for the specific camera hardware, and I don't expect it to be resolved anytime soon. otherwise a great Android phone."
"1811","The first time I put the phone under water the microphone stopped working on calls. I disabled the secondary mic that is for noise suppression and now the main mic seems to be working on calls but the quality is poor. This is a disappointment for a phone with ""aqua"" in the name. The battery life is terrible. It often lasts less than 12 hours. Sony customer support was worthless as usual. Now I have to send it in and be without a phone for 2 weeks. But seriously, it's a $200 phone, so what do you expect."
"1812","It get's hot easily not like red hot but is uncomfortable also poor camera quality"
"1813","I purchased this phone when the price first dropped to $200 on Black Friday. I figured this would be an upgrade to my damaged Nexus 4, rather than repairing it. The great part of this phone is that it had more RAM, drive space and a seemingly faster processor. Plus that fact that I could add an SD card and was waterproof was a bonus.Upon use I immediately noticed that the octa-core processor would heat up the phone very easily, to the point that it would be hot to touch. I use this for everything, from setting appointments, sharing files across apps, playing Candy Crush, running with RunKeeper and playing music, using Waze/Google Maps and posting on Facebook. It acts fine with using one app at a time, but crashes, overheats and slows down completely when multitasking. This is VERY frustrating when I'm trying to make a call or quickly set up directions for navigation.On the plus side, I am happy that it is waterproof. I went running last month, and during the last quarter-mile, I got stuck in a rain storm. Did not affect the device at all.Beside the fact that it has more storage that is also expandable, my Nexus 4 with less cores and less memory easily out-performs this phone. Hopefully the Z-series of this phone is much faster, else I may have to get the more expensive Samsung S series phones to solve my frustrations."
"1814","I bought this phone in Aug of 2015 and I still love it. It has everything that I need and want with a phone. It takes decent photos, and is just the right size for me. I did almost run out of space on it once but the problem was easily resolved by uploading all of my pictures to google drive and then deleting them from my phone. As mentioned by some other reviewers it does heat up sometimes but this is rare and has never been a real problem. The battery life is good, for me itusually last a couple days unless I am constantly using my phone. I did take some pictures with it while standing in a creek where the phone was exposed to some water, not completely immersed, and it was fine. The phone looks really nice and sleek and like I said is the perfect size for me I am 5'4"" and I don't like the huge phones. At the same time the screen seems really big when I am watching something on the phone. I have had the phone almost a year and have had no hardware or software problems. I am so happy I found and bought this cell phone it has definitely met and exceeded my expectations and I only paid a little over 200 dollars for it. I will probably replace it when it is really outdated but it will be hard to part with! I definitely recommend this phone if you are an android person."
"1815","Bought for my wife. She takes a lot of pictures with her camera and this works perfectly for her. The phone part is also nice. I have a Sony and like it very much. Bluetooth with my Sony TV"
"1816","Excelent phone at a good price !! Recomended 100%"
"1817","After having this phone for a few months now, I've found much less to like about it than when I originally got it.Performance is god awful, I dont do a lot on my phone other than basic social media and google play in the background pretty regularly and that already taxes the phone pretty hard to the point I felt like my Nexus 4 was faster (which came out a couple years before this phone did)Battery life is advertised for 2 days under light load which is respectable but I havent seen even near that, if you're constantly using 4G LTE data for even just web browsing the battery drains very quickly and you'll be lucky to see 6 hours on a full charge... charging speeds are decent for micro usbthe camera must be defective for mine because it doesnt seem to focus at all, everything I try to take a picture of looks blurry and it takes forever to snap...Conclusion... Its not a bad phone for 200 bucks but the more I use it the more I wish I just lived without a phone for a bit longer and bought something better."
"1818","I love it"
"1819","My husband truly did like his new phone. Price was terrific when I bought during a flash sale, I think. He likes the phone... and I didn't have to spend three or four times as much on a phone. T-Mobile sim bought with it was perfect, too."
"1820","Pros+Good Looking Design+Good Performance+Waterproof+MicroSD Expansion+Good Camera+Android Pay CompatibleCons-Okay Screen-Average Speaker-Average Battery Life-Decent Performance-Not the only good phone availableShould you buy: YESActual Value $200Sony has made a lot of great, if a bit too frequent, phones. With a waterproof design and glass construction, it has a great record of making phones. However, those phones had competition from Samsung, LG, among others that made it difficult to stand out. Sony, however, has decided to aim for the midrange market by making this: the Xperia M4 Aqua. In 2014, I would’ve recommended this phone instantly. However, in 2016, is it still a good buy among the rest of the excellent lineup of 2015? That is what I tried to find. In short, it is a good phone. But that leaves me conflicted as to where to place this phone in the current state of the market.-Design-Any similarities with any of the phones in the Xperia lineup is no coincidence. In fact, that is kind of its selling point; it doesn’t look like other phones in this price range. The glass found on the front and back is beautiful and feels premium in the hand and from any distance it looks like a much pricier phone. The Sony and Xperia label add a bit of class to this otherwise good looking budget phone. This also makes it a bit disappointing to find a plastic frame instead of a metal one that is found on its older brother. But considering its price, this is something that can be forgiven. In the hand, it feels light enough to easily carry but dense enough to feel like it won’t break easily. That being said, I recommend buying a case immediately in order to prevent any part of the glass from shattering. The front grills on the phone are nice, but they are a bit deceiving. The speaker, unlike the other Xperia, is actually on the bottom of the phone. The top one is an earpiece for calling and the bottom one is a microphone. There is also your typical power and volume rocker, along with a two-stage button. This last button that should be in all phones and I’m surprised that it is a rare thing to find these days. Overall, it is a good looking phone that should make most people happy.-Performance-The specs on this phone are good for the price. It is packing a Snapdragon 615 with 2GB of RAM, 720p display, Android Lollipop, and microSD card expansion. In benchmarks, the phone runs just above the Alcatel Idol 3 (4.7) but a great distance under the Samsung Galaxy S5. It is a respectable score for the price. However, it is a bit confusing in general use. It is snappy most of the time with general day to day task. But sometimes the bloatware that Sony adds to the phone makes it stutter a bit, particularly when multitasking a lot of apps. It never slows down completely or enough to get in the way, but it is noticeable. Most games, or any other graphic demanding app, do run well on this device without an issue with only the heaviest of games stuttering a bit. Apps also run smooth while they are open and even when going back to it while multitasking. In my practical testing, I can open up to 5 apps without any of them closing, including Chrome, Snapchat, YouTube, Amazon app, and Instagram. Signal quality, for the most part, is good. There are a few areas in my area of Los Angeles where I get a weaker signal than what I’ve experienced with OnePlus and Alcatel, but they are minor issues. My top speed running on the T-Mobile network was 54 Mbps download speed and 7 Mbps upload. Call quality is also good from both ends of the call, with both earpiece and loudspeaker providing loud volume and above average quality. While it does have the hardware to use Band 12, it is unable to use it since it doesn’t meet the requirement from T-Mobile. But it still performs well and should be great for most people.-Display-The phone has a 1280 x 720 HD display with a pixel density of 294 ppi. While on paper that does look like a lower level of pixel density than other phones it’s actually good enough for most people, with text looking slightly fuzzy when holding the phone right up close. Colors are good, but not excellent. They are good enough, but next to something like the S5, OnePlus, or even the Alcatel Idol 3 the colors look a bit washed out. The white balance is slightly towards the blue side, but it isn’t that noticeable. Thankfully, Sony does allow for tweaking the display settings should you want to make it good. Contrast and brightness levels, on the other hand, are great and they do allow for it to be usable in direct sunlight. Only thing I have of concern is the glass on the display. I have not found a confirm report as to what the glass is (Gorilla Glass, Dragontrail); the only thing I have found it to be listed as is “scratch-resistant glass.” Just something to keep in mind. Overall it is a decent screen, but there are better options available.-Camera-Sony has a reputation for making quality camera sensors, such as the iPhone and other flagships, so I was expecting some of that tech to drop down to their midrange phone. The result is good, but not much more than that. It comes equipped with a back-facing 13MP camera and a front, wide angle 5 MP camera. I couldn’t find any specific information on the sensor in the back, with Sony limiting themselves to only saying it is a Sony Exmor RS model, but no specific requirement in particular. Since there is no other phone that we can identify with this sensor, we’ll have to judge it independently with other phones in this price category. So, is it good? In general, yes. Photos taken in bright light come out excellent and the phone does focus quick on the subject or background that is being exposed. Colors are a bit lighter than what they are in real life, but it’s not a deal breaker. Low light is surprisingly good for the price. Sure, it isn’t up to the level of an S6 or a G4, but it is above what most other phones can deliver. The phone does suffer from motion blur, so nighttime shots are best left for tripod or steady hands. In short, it is a decent camera perfect for social media.-Software-The Xperia M4 comes with Android Lollipop 5.0 with some extras that range from good to completely useless. The phone has a custom Sony skin that would look okay if the other apps that you had look similar. But their round shape and overall design contrast to all the other apps that you might download. In addition to this, there are also apps that I wish Sony would make downloadable if needed, but removable if not needed. Apps such as XPERIA Lounge and Playstation Video are useless for me since I don’t have a Playstation and other such as Sketch and AR effect are fun, but ultimately just gimmicks. There are also a few small apps that can be used while using another app, for example the browser, a timer, and a calculator. There are also some small apps that can be downloaded from the Play Store, but you still can’t use any apps. Everything else works similarly to stock Android, with performance being much better if there hadn’t added some annoying bloatware to the mix. The good news is that Sony promises an update to 6.0 Marshmallow for 2016, so that is a positive note. Sony did a good job, but I can’t help but wonder it if could’ve been better.-Waterproofing and Extra Notes-Now, on to this phone’s highlighted feature: the water resistance. Just a little bit of information that you should know: Sony never directly states that it is completely waterproof. They even advise against putting it completely underwater. Nevertheless, it is good on its promise of being water resistant. Placing it underwater for 20 minutes completely submerged didn’t harm it and listening to music in the shower worked great. I wouldn’t recommend doing it constantly, but it does give reassurance that water will not kill it. Something I do want to note is that this phone heats up rapidly even when just going through simple web browsing. Also, the battery does not give 2 days of battery life. The power saving modes do help with battery life, but the most I’ve gotten in general use is one day with 4 hours of screen on time. It is good, but nowhere near the 2 hours it claims.-Conclusion-Here is where I have trouble with this phone. Independently, it is a really good phone with good performance for what it is in addition to a beautiful design and waterproofing that gives users the confidence to have it in the rain. However, there is currently a lot of competition that makes it hard to recommend this phone. For starters, if you want the best bang for your buck, there is the Blu Life One X with a better screen and similar design for less money at $149. If you want a compact phone, there is the Alcatel Idol 3 4.7 at $179 which is still a good phone that is lighter. If you want the looks of the M4, what’s wrong with the OnePlus X, which has a much better screen, much more power, and looks almost the same at a slightly higher price of $249? Honestly, any of the above options are great and they are cheaper than the M4. If you really need the waterproofing, then this is one of your cheaper options and definitely the one to get. But for everyone else, the other options would probably be better."
"1821","The phone has some performance issues. It does not automatically connect to known WiFi connections and there are audio issues where it has difficult switching between headphones, to Bluetooth to normal use. Each time this happens a factory reset appears to correct the issue, but clearly that is inconvenient."
"1822","Love this phone! Nice camera, nice design, feels and looks expensive. I get 4g LTE with tmoblie."
"1823","All I can say is WOW! This is a great phone, I don't know about the comments regarding the camera quality, it blows my S5 and Nexus 5x away. Have not had any over heating issues either but I'm not running a bunch of apps at the same time. Works great on Tmobile network. Wait for it to go on sale and for the price it can't be beat."
"1824","OK👌"
"1825","Had this for about 3 weeks now. Phone works without any problems, no heating up but battery life is not as described. I love the phone still though."
"1826","I'm an Iphone user who purchased and set this up for my mother in law. I have used android tablets, so I have a general familiarity with them. I was impressed with this phone, which has a nice screen and everything functions quickly. I was also impressed with the versatility/configurability of android, as this was my first real time spent setting it up. For the money (I got it on a flash deal for $149) I don't think you can beat this device.UPDATE: 3/20/2016For those who've suffered heat or battery life issues, or the ""sleep of death"", I also had this problem, which is highly frustrating. However, these issues resolved for me by using the Sony PC companion software. You have to connect the phone to the computer and in the PC Companion, press start under Support Zone > Start under update phone software > repair phone. Then follow the on screen instructions in the program. Since I did this (a month ago) I've had no further problems and it's been a fantastic phone."
"1827","Thanks, very good"
"1828","I have an LG G3 in RMA. It just resets on its own. I needed a spare phone and was considering a BLU phone until I found this at 50% off the MSRP. This was a lucky impulse buy which I got at the right time.The phone was the E2306. This thing has T-Mobile's HSPA+ (3G) 1700 MHz frequency (not common) for unlocked phones. It also has LTE bands 2,4,5,12,17 which are the majority of T-Mobile and AT&T frequencies.The phone is pretty slick. I love the aesthetics. It feels dense though. I fear if I drop it, it will break.I had a Nexus 5 (32GB) and LG G3 (32GB) before this phone. So I will use them as references.First item to compare… the screen size and resolution. This phone has the smallest size of the 3 and the smallest resolution of 1280 x 720 (HD). Nexus 5 was a Full HD phone and the LG G3 is a Quad HD. I do not feel that I am missing anything with the lower resolution. How small do you need your text? Everything appears to be crystal clear.Next is the RAM… This has 2GB to match the Nexus 5, and 1GB less than the LG G3. I did not see this phone slow down. I have not been playing any games. I have not been using it at its fullest limit.Next is the storage… this phone has the smallest of the 3 phones with 16 GB. So, this will limit the number of apps you can use and install. I saw this limit on a Samsung tablet and I believe this is the greatest detractor. Now, this also has an MicroSD slot. This is something that the Nexus 5 does not have. So potentially, you can store more pictures and music in this device. The LG G3 wins hands down with 32GB internal with MicroSD card expansion slot. As a spare phone, this Xperia M4 is perfect for me. This could be my daily driver if my LG G3 cannot be repaired. (I no longer have the Nexus 5).NFC… all the phones have NFC, and Bluetooth, Wi-Fi wireless N also included.Battery… the battery is not user replaceable. This was the flaw with my Nexus 5 and why it needed to be replaced. The LG G3 wins this factor with a replaceable battery.Processor speed… This is the slowest on paper but it is future proofed with a 64-bit processor. Although it is an Octo (8) core, it is more like 2 quad cores switching between the two. I do not think I am missing the power. It is still as smooth as the other phones.Speaker… The Nexus 5 and this phone has roughly the same location. The LG G3 speaker is on the back. Of the 3 phones mentioned, this has the BEST SPEAKER phone volume and SPEAKER for music.Camera… This has a 13 MP camera. IT IS THE BEST CAMERA OF ALL 3 PHONES NOTED. I have not taken a blurry picture with this phone. It is slower than the LG G3 and about the same speed as the Nexus 5 in taking pictures, but it is worth it for the quality.Waterproof… need I say more. The LG G3 and the Nexus 5 are not. So, I can put this under the sink faucet and wash my phone. This is probably a major reason that the battery is not user replaceable.Other items to note:1. This phone uses a Nano-SIM. This is the smallest of the 3 phone SIM card form factors.2. The native messaging app stinks! Sony dropped the ball on how it handles group SMS/MMS and organizing the received messages on the group. Sony splits ALL the received messages and sending a group MMS requires a subject. Unfortunately, all the replies are still on separate strings. Get another app, like Google Messenger, Textra, Evolve SMS, etc. With all the benefits of this phone, I could not rate this phone below a five star."
"1829","This is an good phone for the price you pay for it with a fluent minimalist interface that I like much more than other Android customizations, like TouchWiz. My only complaints would be that sometimes the colors of my photos are a little bit opaque for my taste and that, although the phone has a good battery life it is far from the two days promised by Sony."
"1830","Awesome! Good quality & affordable price! Thanks Sony!"
"1831","Great!!!!"
"1832","Reading online this seemed like my perfect phone, it had the power I needed and compact and stylish. I'm not a power user by no means I only play a couple of games that my Moto G can handle well and Internet browsing but this phone would constantly close my apps without an error and delete all the progress I had done with it. Not to mention using it in the lowest screen light would still make the phone so hot it would hurt to hold, and even iny pocket without use it would do it. Never had a defective Sony phone before and I got this brand new I honestly think thats just how it was supposed to work, which didn't work for me. I guess if you want a reliable phone and don't use apps or the Internet a lot I would recommend it."
"1833","Very good but I did get a sellsrecite"
"1834","nice phoe"
"1835","very nice phone love it"
"1836","Very good"
"1837","I'm still getting used to it and as usual comes with a lot of apps that you don't want or need but speed is good is easy to customize and was able to do the transition from my old phone pretty quickly"
"1838","it good for price, work tmobile nano pin litle hot dowling"
"1839","Its great but it heats up and it gets to the point were it burns you hand, if you going to use a protector i recommend it and also glass and plastic doesn't feel right, you only choice try it or not."
"1840","Soon It began to be slow and microphone suddenly did not work anymore"
"1841","Bought cause my Z1s was damaged beyond repair and I've only had this one a few days. So far it has been great however I'm not a heavy user of apps and games. I'm hoping the heating and locking and slowing down problems I've read about are simply due to the early lolipop upgrades which nearly bricked my Z1s when it first came out, it was aweful, but after a long while and updates it finally started running smoother and cooler. I really like not having to pull a clip/door open and close every time I want to charge this one. The headphone plug doesn't seem quite as sturdy but if it works it works, the sound with my sony earbuds (the best earbuds for price too) is louder and seems to sound better on the M4 Aqua which is also good. I keep wifi and bluetooth turned off and it seems like it will last about the same maybe a little bit longer on average but not much, maybe could push 3 to 4 days with little to no use during that time, estimating 8 to 24 hours on a heavy day. Direct charging speed from wallwart usb seems pretty fast to me, still slow if usb from my laptop. Over all there are subtle differences, but nothing really bad or nor great, I love the sleek flat design of xperias, abd tho I know support kind of sucks, I'll keep my fingers crossed, I'll remain a Sony fan."
"1842","At first the phone got super hot and battery drained in less than 4 hours. It was either an update or me changing the network to ""2G only"" that helped to solve the problem and now the phone lasts easily for a day."
"1843","Battery does not as long as it is advertised"
"1844","Love the phone and it's under water capabilities. But the screen spiderwebed the first time I dropped it. :/ so the weakest screen on an xperia I've had so far."
"1845","I absolutely love this phone. I'm on it all day long. And yes it is waterproof which makes it even better. I will strictly be buying Sony Xperia phones from now on."
"1846","I am enjoying my phone. It's my first non-windows phone in 7 years. The camera isn't as good as the Lumia 830's camera."
"1847","It's fine for the price (I bought it for 150$+tax), has no so good camera, I was hoping a pretty good camera because... it's sony! But nope, is just ok. Ah, is really a pretty phone, good quality screen. Totally worth for the money."
"1848","ITS A GREAT PHONE!!"
"1849","Phone developed a problem with the microphone after about 10-11 months of regular use, with the microphone completely failing within days of the 1-year warranty being over. Tried hard resetting the phone, upgrading the software to Android 6.0.1, but the problem could not be resolved.Contacted Sony support and after plugging in the IMEI their website says my phone was not under warranty, even though it was within a year of my purchase date from Amazon.Also had regular problems with SMS messages on this phone - messages received from people would periodically be in all Chinese characters (copied and pasted to Google Translate and the translation made absolutely no sense). I also had quite an unreliable time receiving MMS group text messages, with some responses not being received, or in the incorrect order. This is after consulting with the AT&T website and confirming that I had the correct APN settings entered.I tried the default Sony messaging app, Google Messenger, Google Hangouts, Textra, and other SMS/MMS apps, with no success.I have thrown in the towel on this phone, especially after the manufacturer refused to honor the 1-year warranty (as advertised in the product description)."
"1850","The phone won't turn on again, only 6 months after buying it."
"1851","Great smartphone. Everything is ok. No problem at all. The price was even better. Thanks."
"1852","Another great Xperia smartphone from Sony. Nothing to complain about. Great phone."
"1853","The phone runs very well when I first got it the battery got really hot not sure what the problem was there but after the system update and restarting the phone it doesn't get hot anymore I wouldn't put it completely under water but I have used it in the shower many times never had a problem with any of the functions. to prank my friends I poured water on it thrown it in puddles and tossed around with a case of course and it's still fine. The wife didn't like the quality of the camera she likes to take selfies I didn't really find anything wrong with the camera myself"
"1854","Excellent works very well in Venezuela Movistar"
"1855","Oh this phone is great. I love SONY!! Sleek design and very good."
"1856","This phone has mostly just caused me problems. Sim cards won't work, pictures won't store, wifi is spotty. Just a headache."
"1857","all fine"
"1858","Product received super fast and as described."
"1859","Excelent"
"1860","Love it"
"1861","Overheating problems since the first days. I hate this phone"
"1862","Really good for the price. I have had the phone for about 2 months.I'll get to the two things I don't like1) No Wireless charging... can't really complain but the flagship phones have it. For the price this is no big deal but I miss it.2) Camera is ok. Its not great. If you buy a phone for casual photos you'll be fine... if the camera is biggest deal ever for you then you may be disappointed."
"1863","This is a sweet phone. They make the phone look really classy like Sonys higher end models. The insides are quality components that should perform better, but comparison tests show that it is a bit slower than similar hardware. Attribute that to the 'pretty'sony software/theme. Testers go out of their way to really torture this phone on youtube (see xperia m4 aqua nutella, knife, waterproof) and this ip68 rated phone does really well. I love this phone and am considering their tablet now. Water And dust proof, beautiful design, memory slot. What more to ask for? Laugh at those fools that spend nearly a grand on these 'smart phones', and then end up getting it wet or shattering it. No nense in spending that especially when you will replace them in a year or two. Thats just being a dumb user and giving money away to the company so the can build a spaceship campus. Battery life is impressive: with everything on (broadband data, wifi, bluetooth) and normal use (texting, phone, some surfing) it can go 3.5 to 4 days between full charge. The full charging itself is very fast, i say under 2hrs. This is all without Sonys battery saving modes! I'm testing the two battery saving modes now. Incredible phone, and looks very nice. Buy this phone for 2-3 hundred, spend another 15 on nice rubber case and glass screen protector. This phone looks and feels amazing in its protection, not clumsy and goofy like those samsungs and apples. Yes, get this phone and you will have a smart phone with a smart user, instead of blowing a grand on some ARM PoS that can barely compute."
"1864","Ok. Overall. The delivery was delayed by a week. User experience is excellent with the price."
"1865","Very Good Smartphone! Im happy with this cellphone is very fast"
"1866","Bought this phone on September 7 2015 and my screen was damaged I did not drop the phone or anything I turned it on and the screen looks dim from the bottom and lightly dimmmed on top and the screen looks blurry didn't even last a whole two months."
"1867","Great!"
"1868","The microphone dont work, a shame !!!"
"1869","So I just got the phone today and I'll leave another review in a few weeks. So far it's nice. The touch response is great, the resolution is great, the camera isn't bad if you manually adjust it, but the shutter is slow and having to change the settings often could be a drag. The only thing that scared me is that I've felt a couple momentary lags and it's the first day, but I was installing a bunch of apps, so we'll see. It's just my opinion, but I like the UI. I really hope I can enable voice to text. I bought the phone at $200,so it was definitely worth the price. The port covers are awesome, much better than those on the first z. My wife had the moto g 3rd Gen, so I'll leave a comparison soon."
"1870","great phone easy to use, the only disadvantage I found is that it heats rapidlyboth the frontal and back cameras have a very good resolution"
"1871","I cannot figure out how to use it."
"1872","Poor packaging. The phone that was sent to me does not have us warranty. Amazon cheated me on this. I tried to register on Sony support site. It says that this phone is not meant for US and does not recognize it's IMEI and says no warranty. Battery drains fast. Back Camera takes awful pictures. Did not expect that from Sony. Not sure if I got new one or refurbished crap. Feeling cheated."
"1873","Best phone I have ever owned and clearly one of the top ten Android phones ever made."
"1874","Excellent phone does everything as advertised. I'm very happy. For the money you would be hard pressed to find a phone with similar features."
"1875","This is my first mid grade Smart Phone, and I love it so far!"
"1876","So after long deliberation about my first smartphone, I chose the Sony Xperia M4 Aqua. I have had Sony Ericsson phones before that were very sturdy so I was hoping for something similar. My husband trusted my judgement, and also needed a new phone, so we ended up ordering two. We've had them for seven weeks now;Frankly, I am very disappointed. If I have one word to describe this phone, it would be: slow. I did not install that much apps or anything, but when switching on the phone, it just takes a long time. Also, when opening social media apps like whatsapp or facebook, it just keeps switching off and on while you are typing, extremely annoying. Taking a picture of something that is not a still object, is practically impossible. It takes 3-4 sec to take the shot, which is a very very long time. So you end up always missing that one moment. And when you take the picture, after a few seconds you see a frame being 'saved' but this is not the picture you end up with. So blurry pictures are now a big part of my library, unfortunately.Even worse with the video recording - without any sign that something is wrong, they can end up completely black. I was taping two of our friends saying 'I do' at their wedding, and afterwards it turned out there was absolutely nothing on the tape (you did see that something was taped though, and I could 'play' it, but as said, it is completely black). Next video I tried turned out fine - no idea why. But again, I missed the big moment because of the phone.When someone calls and you just touch the screen somewhere to pick up the phone, you are disconnected most of the times.My husband's phone stopped working after five weeks of light use - microphone did not work in 4 out of 5 times. He had to ship it to be looked at and has to miss his phone 15 business days without any replacement. This is completely unacceptable for a brand new phone! He should just get a new one, if you ask me.Also, be careful when placing the phone in your pocket, because the back tends to become really, really hot- almost too hot to touch at one point. Can not be healthy to walk around with, close to your body.And the last thing I do not like is the fact that it is too big for my hands, but that's just because I have rather small hands.What do I like -- I like the design- I like the fact that it's water proof, however did not put this to the test yet- I like the the ringtones- I definitely like the battery life (two days easily), takes at least 6 hours to recharge though.But I would not recommend it to anyone.UPDATE: in looking for a solution for the videos always turning out black - I found that this is an issue that is often reported and well know to Sony. Their only solution is to restart the phone. Then 1 or 2 videos can turn out OK."
"1877","Excelente"
"1878","I got this on a lightening deal for $200 bucks. However, I want to address some claims. Unless you are a very light user you will not get two days off a charge. If you are a heavy user, you might not get one day. I'm a moderate user and typically end the day in the 20%'s, which is good compared to my old iPhone. In spite of reviews, games with a lot of graphics do not play well with this phone, a lot of lag. Angry Birds, Minion Rush, laggy. Camera is a big disappointment, slow to turn on and slow shutter response. Quality is ok, you just never know when you're going to get the picture taken. Other apps all work well without lag. I really like the thinness of the phone and the 5"" screen. Audio connected thought Bluetooth is loud. Call quality is ok. Works great with Android Pay."
"1879","Great phone, good price."
"1880","Pros- Thin. Is water resistant.Cons- Weak radios for wifi and LTE signal strengths weaker than $25 Moto G. ""Skips"" during playback of MP3 files-- that is just downright pathetic! Comes loaded with all kinds of Sony bloatware. Slow loading apps. Slow switching apps. Slow loading Chrome and Maps.About me: I'm a old school nerd. Was born with a silver AT 286 in my mouth.I do NOT recommend this phone."
"1881","Very speed"
"1882","Ok! It works very well!"
"1883","The Sony Xperia M4 Aqua is an excellent device for those on a budget looking for a good Android phone. Although, the first phone I received would keep powering off on its own. But I contacted Amazon about the issue, and they sent me a replacement. This phone has all the features as other smartphones, but still maintains its low price. The front, and back cameras are both very clear. The flash on this Sony phone is bright and gives you the right lighting to take capture every moment. The phone features excellent speakers to listen to music. Watch a movie, or anything else you want. I would recommend this phone to anybody looking for a nice smartphone, that isn't crazily priced."
"1884","The phone is charging and I am very disappointed. What can I do I just bought the phone"
"1885","The phone itself is great. No noticeable lag other than starting the camera.Although the phone might be pretty awesome for the price IT IS NOT COMPLETELY WATERPROOF! I've been trying to get a hold of customer support, but being like most customer support they don't help for s***!Good phone for the price but sony lies about being waterproof."
"1886","just love it!"
"1887","The microphone and speaker stop working"
"1888","This phone took two months intell it started to miss up the phone itself looks nice but it gets hot fast it started to make calls by itself and apps would just open by there self it pisses me off bad that It does this I wish I can get my money back."
"1889","Great deal! Decent quality phone for the price. This phone lacks a few things that my s5 has, but it makes up for lack of hardware with great Sony software."
"1890","GPS didn't work on the first phone I received, returned for replacement without any issues. New phone works perfectly so far."
"1891","EXCELLENT"
"1892","Phone bricked itself after 5 months. Tried to fix it using several different versions of Sony's software updater to little effect. Stuck on a boot loop... got as far as Sony logo followed by the regular blue wave screen then shuts off and restarts. First update got the Sonly logo with dark back ground shuts off and reboots. Second update after i got a message from sony that there was an update for this phone.. Now it's a white background with the sony logo and it shuts off and reboots. Been too busy to get warranty service got as far as getting an RMA only to have no time (and little access to a printer) and having it expire.The good news is the phone ran fantastic before this. I could not recommend a better phone at this price range. I only write this review because I saw it for the price I bought it for.Update 10/11/2016Tried another new update from sony still stuck on the bootloop. This is just becoming my own fault. I should of made the time to finally get the RMA and return this phone. Meanwhile bought a BLU phone with amazon ads... that one is working almost as good as this one when it was working."
"1893","This phone was terrible. It must no t put out a very strong signal. Had phone service issues for the two months I suffered using the phone. I do not recommend using this phone."
"1894","Excelent celphone"
"1895","buena maquina."
"1896","I'have many problems with the phone, the phone no boot, haw can I replace the item, I'm fromArgentina!!!!"
"1897","Great product. Not watter proof, dont put it under watter. Everything else is pretty cool about the phone."
"1898","The phone cycles on and off as it pleases, and malfunctions quite often, despite not being full or near full on memory space. The battery has quickly become non-existent to the point where I must keep a lipstick battery source attached during the day. If you purchase this phone, also realize that accessories are extremely limited."
"1899","Nice phone"
"1900","Great waterproof phone without an insane price. Fast processor and Sony makes it easy to update android versions."
"1901","for the price it is a decent phone. specs, waterproof, weight, and size. The camera however for the high pixels wasn't that great and the phone couldn't record any videos, all we get was a black screen with audio only. After a google search we weren't the only ones experiencing this problem. Haven't experience overheating but do get random power off where only a hard reset will solve it, not reliable if it shut off and you're expecting calls or alarms. The seller and shipping was great, not so much the phone. I say pass and get something more reliable and less bloatware."
"1902","Bad"
"1903","I like this phone and its Sony features,,, especially the waterproof feature, though I have not dropped my phone into 5 feet of water yet. I have not experienced the battery lasting and entire 24 hour period yet or a 14 hour period where I didn't have to recharge this phone. My advice is, if you plan to take an extended trip some where be sure to take your charging cable and a spare charge.I do like the phone anyway."
"1904","I originally wanted the Sony Xperia Z3, but for less than half the price I finally decided to buy the M4 Aqua GSM/LTE Unlocked. All in all it's a great phone (so far after 1 month). Build quality is good, processor is fast, and the screen is beautiful. Battery lasts for 2-3 days but I'm not a heavy user. Regarding the heating/overheating issues mentioned in other reviews, I only encountered this while I was playing a game - the phone did seem hot but wasn't too bad because I was using a protective case and the phone performance wasn't affected. One other point: I previously used a Sony Xperia S and the camera was terrible - the camera on the M4 Aqua is much better and takes great photos so this is a definite improvement. I'm very pleased with this phone and for the price it's a winner!"
"1905","very good phone !!!"
"1906","An amazing phone, is only $200 but it works as similar as other most expensive phones. I love the camera, the battery, the design. It is amazing and it works as good as a phone of $400"
"1907","Got this for $150 before Christmas. For the price nothing else competes.Pros: Fast, waterproof, Sony's music app, waranty, good battery.Cons: camera is somewhat slow but still takes good images."
"1908","So far I really like this phone based on previous phones I have had in the past. The specs on this phone are a bit outdated for 2016, but for the price and quality specs aren't everything trust me! The processor speed and internal storage of only 16GB might deter some from considering buying this M4, but consider what that means in real world functionality. The difference of a processor that is 1.2Ghz or 1.8Ghz in real word application is so minimal that the average smartphone user will NEVER notice the difference. What makes a huge difference is the smoothness of the OS and the skins companies overlay on top of a platform like ANDROID. I have used NEXUS brand phones with similar processing speed and I have noticed a slight difference in the smoothness of the OS, but I would attribute that to the fact that a purely vanilla ANDROID experience will always give you smoother performance when compared to other phones that come with ""bloatware"" or other skins. That being said, I think SONY does a pretty good job of not overly bogging down the processor of this phone with its pre-installed bloatware. (But yes it comes with bloatware that really impacts your storage, so delete as much of the bloatware as you can, your battery and phone will thank you!)Pros:The PriceThe Build Quality (very premium feel)The Speaker Quality is better than average, but not the best I've heardCall Quality is Crisp on T-Mobile's networkAndroid 5.0 is the Current version installed ( I consider this a pro because of the issues I've heard about 5.1 on other devices...very subjective opinion)The Design is clean and not too outlandish very classic design to it.The Touch Screen is very responsiveAnd the Charge time is excellent for a phone with this sized batteryCons:The Screen Smudges with finger prints like nobody's buisnessThe battery though it charges fast, seems to drain even faster. This is most likely a user issue and if you're like me and have a Pebble and Fitbit tethered to your phone ALL DAY I guess battery drain like that is to be expected, but the claims of not having to charge your phone for 3-7 days is definitely untrue.The camera is not good at all. Very slow focusing and the pictures appear to be overly saturated. The pixels are way too visible for any type of definition, so beware!I also don't care for the pre-installed apps that take a majority of the memory space. (An SD card will absolutely be needed, so if you are going with this phone, please order on along with it.Summation:In all the price and build quality is a plus for a phone that is 2 years old. The smartphone industry moves fast and there is always a better phone that is better than the BEST phone out there....(does that make sense?) I try not to compare any phone too heavily with others that are clearly in a different class or category. This is not an iPhone 6 nor is it a Samsung Galaxy S6, so please don't compare it to those. But for everyday use for people who value a good value, I would recommend the SONY line and especially the M4 or comparable models. I do appreciate support that Sony offers on its products, and that alone helps me to be confident that I can get ""some support"" software wise and otherwise with this product. If you're considering this phone for yourself or spouse or other...it's a good buy in my opinion.Hope it helps you with your decision.Cheers!"
"1909","A very solid, budget-minded phone offering from Sony! This was my first Xperia phone, and my most recent, coming from a Lenovo K3 Note.HighlightsWaterproof-ish is pretty cool, very solid build despite plastic frame, Incredibly clear call quality, and LTE delivers 42mbps with a good signal on T-Mobile's network in the southeast.ProsIP65/68, NFC, SD card slot, LTE, unlocked, US Manufacturers warranty (One Year, only on new devices)Cons720p Screen, Sony bloat, Odd USB port placement, Weak equalizer/audio adjustment features, Amazon's model, the E2306, is not rootable without considerable software modificationsNotesThe phone automatically downloads your APN settings dependent upon the simcard inserted automatically; sony say there will be a marshmallow upgrade this year, but it hasn't shown up yet for this device; I bought used before I bought new, my used device ceased operation after 4 days; Because the device is watertight, it may get warm during operation. It is for this reason, people believe that the processor is underclocked to keep the device cooler, which may contribute to some lagginess in menusI have the Tudia TPU case, which fits extremely well, and the Mr Shield matte screen protectors look excellent on the phone. Zagg apparently makes a front/back shield for the phone, but does not sell it in the US."
"1910","I really love this phone but when I bought it after like a month the phone camera stopped working suddenly as well as the flashlight which is a real bummer. I have to go fix it next week Thursday or Friday so yeah that's it"
"1911","Of all the waterproof Rugby smart phones I've owned this is the Best! And at a reasonable price."
"1912","The device is failing after a minutes the phone is hot and restart and after that I can use it"
"1913","I'ts a good cellphone!!"
"1914","Pros: Nice graphic, good camera, loud music, recharging fast, a lot of memory, and I've always love how slim Sony Android phones are.Cons: The battery doesn't last very long even when I turn the STAMINA mode on. Sometimes I can't swipe the screen for like a second or 2. Easy to get hot, like way too hot I cannot leave in my pocket anymore I have to put it on a cold table to cool it down, and then it restarts itself for 2, 3 times.=> An okay phone for an okay price."
"1915","I don't do anything crazy on my phone. I'm not running any call of duty games or even adding music to it. I have the normal girl apps like Facebook candy crush and Gmail. Every time I go to watch a trailer or a 30 second video on YouTube it will not play stating an error has occurred. I'm connected to WiFi in different locations. I'm not happy with this purchase at all"
"1916","Quick response time. Great product. The package arrived on time and was exactly as described."
"1917","Good unlock phone for the price!"
"1918","great smartphone!"
"1919","I picked up this phone when it was a little less in price due to the water proof capabilities. I have always liked the little UI improvements Sony has done to the Android interface. It isn't overdone and bloated like the Samsung's, its way more elegant and simple in my opinion. It's much closer to a ""stock"" android experience. Also the stamina mode is a cool addition, depending on how you use your phone of course.The only thing that is holding this phone back is the bad snapdragon processor(Snapdragon 615) that is in this device. It isn't bad per se, but it over heats so quick it throttles the processor back so it makes the phone feel slower than it should be. This is the same issue that the Snapdragon 810 had. If this phone didn't have this processor it would be so much easier for me to suggest to someone.The phone itself is nice. Its thin, light and fits fairly well in the hand for a 5"" phone. It isn't the narrowest phone out there, like the newer xperia xa, but it isn't horrible. O yeah, its also water and dust proof! I don't do any heavy gaming on my mobile devices so I can't comment on that. The none 3D heavy games functioned fine for me though(it does get hot on the back though).This phone is updated to android 6.0.1 so it's good that sony kept up with that. I'd assume this is going to be the last update it gets.Battery life was good for me. I'll give some info on how I use my phone so you can compare. I use 3 mail aps for email, with one of them being the included gmail app. Facebook, snapchat, some news feed aps, hangouts for sms and another 2 social aps. With using all those a few times over a 10 hour span I was over 60% all of the time. Thats very good for me and comparable to an iphone 6 I also have.Overall I do like the phone, but the snapdragon 615 holds its back from being a truly good phone."
"1920","Speaker is not good"
"1921","I need to preface this entire review by saying I am a lifelong Mac and iOS user. This is my first Android phone, and it was purchased for a very specific purpose; I wanted a waterproof device to use for web browsing, reading, and messaging while I was on the beach or in the tub. I didn't want a device that would replace my primary iPhone 6s Plus. I just wanted an affordable device that was durable, and I wouldn't be sad about breaking if it did. Since Apple doesn't make a waterproof phone or tablet at this time, I had to look elsewhere. This is how I came up with the M4 Aqua.At the time of ordering the M4 Aqua, it was $149. I didn't know anything about Android, but having been updated to the latest Android OS (Marshmallow), it seemed as if this price was a steal. In retrospect, I would have paid as much as $200 for this device.Coming from iOS, Android OS is complete culture shock. Things don't ""just work"" like they do with Apple's offerings, and I often found myself needing to take three steps to do something that would have been one step on iOS. However, this wasn't supposed to be a replacement phone, so that being said it makes an excellent complimentary device. Actually, it is more than just a complimentary device. Despite its many failings when compared to iOS, I quickly fell in love with the ultra customizable nature, and all around gadget like feel of Android OS on the M4 Aqua. I have an IT background, and I like tweaking options and squeezing extra battery or performance out of my devices. It's like a fun little challenge to me. So I actually realized that I've been missing out. As much as I love the reliability and increased productivity that iOS gives me, I loved the ability to mess around with so many options. That's enough about my first time Android experience, let's talk about the device itself.- The device feels great in my hand. It's plastic, and not glass like Sony's more elevated offerings. However, it still looks and feels like a premium phone.- Obviously it's water resistant. I tested this multiple times. I made sure the SIM card and SD card slot were securely closed each time. The headphone jack and the usb port remain open during submersion though. As crazy as it sounds, it always works fine after a dunk. I would always wipe it off before using it again though. This is simply because it's impossible to use a wet phone screen well.- The camera is downright terrible. I don't know if it's the sensor, or the software, but it's just awful compared to my iPhone 5, let alone my iPhone 6s Plus. Do not buy this device for the camera.- This device lags a bit. Compared to iOS, but also compared to other Android devices, the Snapdragon in this thing just can't keep up all the time. That being said, the device is wonderfully useable in most casual scenarios. Things like web browsing, messaging, emails, and social media, give no problems at all.- Games run terribly on the Aqua M4. Minecraft Pocket Edition has this constant choppiness regardless of how turned down the graphics settings are. I had this experience with almost any game I played. Oddly, Pokemon Go worked great. That being said, don't buy this device for playing games. Also, it's not capable of the Sony Remote Play for remote PS4 sessions, so don't buy it for that purpose either.- Battery lasts a day with average use. I don't know where Sony gets their two day battery number from, but it would be almost impossible to use this phone normally and get 16 hours out of it let alone two days. That being said, I had no problem getting a whole day of battery out of the phone. I was pleased with this.- Wifi is fast and snappy. I have a set of Eeros in my house, and this device had no problem connecting and offering great speed.- The Micro SD card slot is helpful, and kind of necessary. 16GB is great for a casual user like me, but if you want to do anything above and beyond you're going to need some extra storage. Once I updated to Marshmallow, I had 8 gigs left of the 16 available.- The included headset actually sounds pretty good. I was surprised by this. I use Apple Music on my Aqua M4 of course since I'm an iOS user primarily, and it always sounded terrific with the included headset.- The speaker itself is horrible. I wouldn't expect too much out of this. Again, almost every iPhone speaker back to the 3G is superior to the speaker in this phone.- Phone calls sounds great, and this is the one place where the speaker in the phone doesn't give you any trouble. Speaker phone usage on this guy is actually better than on my 6s Plus. This is both in terms of them hearing me, and me hearing them.- The screen size is perfect. Somehow Apple really missed the boat on this one. This screen is slightly larger than an iPhone 6s, but smaller than an iPhone 6s Plus. I truly wish Apple made a single phone that was this size, instead of its current offerings. For a male with medium sized hands, this thing fit perfectly. I typed consistently better on it than my iPhone SE or iPhone 6s Plus when in vertical mode.- I can't tell for sure, but I don't think this phone has an accelerometer. Pokemon Go can't find it for the purpose of augmented reality, and the auto rotation for phone orientation works terribly. So that would make sense.- Apps are slow to start, but once you're in an app things seem to cruise along fairly smoothly.- Having been an iPhone user, I find the vibration motor in this thing to be SUPER strong. It is loud, and would vibrate right off a table if I wasn't careful.All in all, I love this phone for my purposes. It's sleek. It's thin. It's from my second favorite hardware company in the world, Sony. It's water resistant. It's dust proof. It's bright enough to use in the sun. It has enough battery to make it through the day. It really makes a perfect second phone. I really love this thing.As a random side note, I thought I was getting a white phone and although the box had a white phone on it, my phone ended up being black. I didn't mind, but I was surprised.It's a bit sluggish to recommend as a daily driver, but it would be a great gift for someone who needs a second phone that is water resistant, or someone who hasn't had a smart phone before.Sony, great job for making a phone that still holds up almost two years later!"
"1922","Glad I went with a this always wanted a Sony phone but not didn't want anything too fancy. Great design awesome music play back camera is good haven't used it much to be honest"
"1923","I bought this phone in august, and it's only been slightly more than a month since I have it.. And the batteries are already starting to fail.. They r not charging as they should.. They heat up very fast.. And the charge doesn't last as long as it should"
"1924","The phone worked good during the first 6 months, then it just started to reboot continuosly while I was making calls or using some apps, also turning off the wifi and bluetooth, having to reset the phone several times in the day. Finally I decided to give it away and get a Nexus phone.Also the 13 MP camera resolution is only available in 4:3 size, not the 16:9 full screen. The same for the front 5 MP camera."
"1925","I really love this phone, the features are amazing. Love the slim look. To me, it really takes great selfish but disappointed about the rear camera, especially at night. The flash is horrible, my bf purchased a Apple iPhone 4s and his phone is only 8mp and his phone takes much better pics at night. Also for some reason the gets hot! Not sure why!"
"1926","I bought this as a phone for my kid. It has served its purpose well enough.Pros:- Not too big (it's getting hard to find a 5"" screen anymore).- Waterproof (though we haven't tested it much, we have accidentally spilled liquid on it and it didn't break).- Reasonable specs.- Android Marshmallow 6.0.1 update recently released (installed it through Sony's Xperia Companion PC application).- Good support for AT&T and T-mobile frequency bands (including 3G AWS and LTE band 12, which are not easy to find)- SD card support.Cons:- Camera is not great.- Sony firmware is not great (have run into various ridiculous bugs -- like Google voice not working with Sony's dialer, and the front camera not working -- and it has been slow to update, though the latest firmware seems to work well).- No option for more than 16GB internal storage.- Have to jump through hoops to use adoptable storage in Sony's released Android Marshmallow 6.0.1 firmware.I paired this with a PNY U3 Turbo Performance 32GB SD card (which I think cost ten bucks when I got it). With the Marshmallow update, I am using the SD card as adoptable storage, and as the storage backing the /storage/emulated/0 space (so it is the default spot for pictures, app data, etc). Sony's released firmware doesn't totally support this, so you have to enable it using ADB, which is annoying, but not a killer. I have the card formatted 70/30 between adoptable and portable storage, because the Sony camera app doesn't like the SD card being the default internal storage. The storage space reported in settings->storage also is a little wonky. But other than that, it works fine. Performance in the adoptable storage setup is fine.With the adoptable storage setup, I now have enough free space in the default media storage location use Google's camera app (since for whatever reason Google hates SD cards, and so their camera app has no option to save to SD). Google camera seems to capture better images than Sony's built-in one.UPDATE Oct 2016: Sony released a new firmware version for this phone. Nothing super exciting (the only thing I noticed was that the android security patch level went from Apr 2016 to Jul 2016). But I thought it was worth mentioning that even though Sony has said there will be no new Android versions released for this phone, that it still released an updated firmware package with security patches."
"1927","Everything is fine... 👍"
"1928","Good smartphone"
"1929","Really unblocked phone. Has Russian in settings. Excellent phone."
"1930","I was pleased with the Sony Xperia M4 Aqua. Thank you Sony and Amazon!"
"1931","Perfecto"
"1932","the reason i gave this phone a bad review is not because its a bad phone but because the sellers from amazon screwed me by knowingly giving me a bad phone because at the time i was purchasing this phone it was out of stock i went and bought a like new version of this phone it was described as in new working condition just and open package that and it was close to the original price to sadly it arrived in very poor packaging and when i tried to insert my sim card it did not register it i called sony and after 2 weeks of software updates and troubleshooting i sent it to a sony repair center where it took around a month for them to fix it and charge me $60 to replace the sim card holder inside the phone now the phone works fine and i love it the only cons i can think of this phone is that the battery life isnt as great as they advertise its average and the camera quality is ok other than that its a great phone and i would recommend this phone to anyone to buy NEW not any other options"
"1933","Price worth the living"
"1934","I only had it for 4 days, it was awesome till I got it stolen."
"1935","This is my second Xperia phone and boy do I love it. It does everything my Samsung Galaxy S5 did. For the price it was a steal. I see now I should have just stayed with a Sony phone. The pictures are perfect. The screen is vibrant with colors. I recommend this phone."
"1936","It is not actually water resistant and the camera is so slow to process and save. Except that, I think it is a good phone for the price"
"1937","Completely waterproof (Tested with the bathtub) and works great."
"1938","Not too excited with performance. Gets HOT when installing updates. Wifi is iffy."
"1939","a bit wonky system wise but overall a good phone"
"1940","Not all shine is goldI have less than 15 days using the phone, with all due care and the device does not start, hangs all the time, I have to restart it to work but only the first minutes, then I stopped using it again goes out and does not switch . I am very annoyed since it seemed to be the best at a fair price but really regret it."
"1941","Grat phone. Quality / Price"
"1942","Great Phone forGreat price"
"1943","Phone is sleek and nice. Processor is fast and has lots of ram space. Haven't tried it in water so I can't rate that feature. Now getting used to the smaller size after having the T2 for a while. Comparable to that the battery in this phone is awfullllllll. Takes over 2 hrs to charge sometimes and runs down very quickly. Why charge a phone so long just to get a mere under 6 hour life?!? ... Only con I have so far."
"1944","funciona barbaro, espero que siga asi"
"1945","No. The phone is bad."
"1946","Really good!"
"1947","It worked great for a while, now it restarts on its own, rejects the Sim card often and the speaker to hear calls doesn't work. I've kept the phone in excellent condition with a case and this still happened, I expected more from and ""outdoor water proof phone"" I never did test how water proof it is but I'm afraid it'll stop working if I do, now I have to buy a new phone since this one sucked. I bought it in December and it's now mid April so 5months of life then it goes to s***"
"1948","the phone is 7.3 mm. It's pretty slim and feels sturdy in your hand. The power and volume buttons are weirdly placed at the right middle side of the phone. In my case, this proves to be a good thing because I have small-medium hands. There is one front facing speaker, SD card slot on the left, charging port on the left, micro simcard on the right, a headphone jack on the top, and a camera button on the bottom right( to take photos instead of touching the screen) . The back of the phone is plastic but looks like glass. The back and front of the phone are very vulnerable to scratches; I recommend buying a screen protector and cover. There are no physical home buttons. The phone is water proof, but you should wipe your screen after putting it in water as it tends to become unresponsive when you touch the screen.finally the phone is awesome."
"1949","Gets heated for basic use only, worst battery life ,quite slow sometimesNever expected this kind of product from Sony.The first update took more than 1 hr to complete.The only good thing about this phone is fits well in your hands.sleek and slim"
"1950","excellent product quality"
"1951","Overall I like the phone, I can't hear it when it rings if I;m out in the world. I only hear it if I'm sitting quietly in a quiet place. The other thing I don't like is that I can't write emails in blue. My last phone allowed me to write emails in color if I wanted to, and this one doesn't allow it. The phone makes nice noises though, I like the ring tones, and I like the chime noise when I get a text. It takes nice pictures, and it works very well apart from the fact that I can't hear it some times. I have normal hearing by the way."
"1952","I have to agree with everyone that says, ""the phone has a heating problem."" Apart from the heating issue for minimal use; the phone lags doing stuff that my Nexus 4(2012) does with out lag. I bought it for $145 and it is what it is. I do like the look."
"1953","This phone is awesome. I've yet to try and see just how water proof it is, but I imagine it holds up to exactly the standard it says it does. As for the performance, the phone is pretty snappy, especially when android Lollipop is installed. All the features of a phone work as you'd expect them to e.g. Bluetooth, Wireless, Calls, Texting, etc. The phone looks amazing and takes amazing pictures as well. The media experience for music, pictures, and video all have a nice appearance and easy navigation. Definitely recommend this phone. The only downside is that it can get rather warm when charging in a car. And the micro USB port is in a bit of an odd spot (Top left side of the phone)."
"1954","Much better than I've expected!!"
"1955","Serious problems with battery and overheating. Can't use it anymore :("
"1956","Good"
"1957","As expected good product"
"1958","I have had three of these through one purchase. I love the looks, I love the OS, I love the theoretical waterproofing.The challenge is durability. The first one stopped recognizing the SIM card. The second one the display went out, and the screen would not display at all. The third one, the most carefully taken care of, reboots at random and has a different issue with the screen pixelating. This is a beautiful phone. The feel is terrific, I just wish it was more reliable."
"1959","75% as good as my blu, the touch is too or less sincitive . At diff. Times."
"1960","only a month, the screen broken"
"1961","A few Sony phones have a known issue with their ear piece speaker (this model included), and you will have to wait for months to get it repaired/replaced even under warranty."
"1962","This was my second Xperia and had me missing my old Xperia. I had to return after the ear speaker started to sound extremely low after 6 months of use. The phone gets really hot during calls because it's a very thin phone. The front camera is a joke, it looks very dark even if I turn on a bright as hell light near it. The pixel resolution looks good but my face looks like I'm 50 years older unless I turn on the smooth face beauty option in the settings. To take a picture in the rear camera you have to be very still because it lags several seconds. I have t-mobile and I have to use WiFi calling a lot and this phone I would be lucky to catch a chance for my call to go through and catch a signal to make a call, I've never had this issue in my t-mobile Xperia phone. Aside from all this, the interface is great, super fast. This advertises as a one year US warranty and this is misleading because I sent Sony an email and they said they couldn't give refunds and to contact amazon. They didn't even offer to give a replacement, only to do a software repair (which is like a factory reset). So I did it all and Amazon gave me 177 back when I paid 199.99 after 6 months of use. I really hope they don't sell the phone here that I sent back. I really wanted to love this phone but I couldn't take it anymore, I'm disappointed."
"1963","This is not the worst phone in the world, but it's really not that good either. After about 2 months, the battery started pooping out, and now after 4 months, the battery only lasts about 5 hours before it's done, that is, as long as I don't use it, If I spend about 20 minutes in the morning looking at facebook, or using it in any other way, I get about 3 hours. It's just not a quality phone, it has plenty of features, but it's slow. This is a very slow phone. All in all, this phone isn't worth the money. I did bring it into the swimming pool with me, and there were no leaks or problems at all, so that's a plus. As person who's lost several phones to water, this phone meets that expectation, but overall, this phone is lacking"
"1964","everything was perfect!"
"1965","Nice phone. THe battery last 2days, Ive had no problems."
"1966","Excelent phone!"
"1967","Good item."
"1968","Excellent product, arrived at the right time"
"1969","The microphone dont work, a shame !!!"
"1970","I was very optimistic, im an Android lover. So I decided to get my first Sony Android Smartphone and im highly disappointed. The mic was faulty and did not work, Im not sure if it was hardware or a software problem. When someone called me they couldn't hear me at all, so it made the phone quite useless. I tried to love the phone, the build material is great and feels good in the hands. The waterproof design is a huge bonus the Sony UI is also simple and clean but quite buggy at times. This tends to be a problem with Sony their smartphones always have something minor or major wrong with them."
"1971","Excellent phone for an excellent price! Looks and feels great, and the screen is awesome. It's awesome now that the flap is no longer needed to cover the charging port and still get waterproof protection. Can't recommend this phone enough!"
"1972","it came with a problem and since the day i gave it to the lab of israel import of product i've been running for over a month and half trying to see where my phone at. i gave it september 17th and untill today still dont have it back."
"1973","Thanks excellent"
"1974","Awesome"
"1975","f.... small sim card ."
"1976","I have problems with the microphone cell , sometimes it works and sometimes not. and I buy less than a month ago"
"1977","Lot of heating issues ... heats up on charging and on normal browsing"
"1978","For the sub-$300 price, this device sounds great on paper. It turns out it's MOSTLY okay. Mine is currently about to be sent back to Sony, but more on that in a moment.The design mirrors the xperia z3 for the most part, but that's a matter of taste really so I won't say much except to note that the glass back panel on the z3 has been replaced by a very scratchable PLASTIC panel on the m4 aqua. That's ok at this price range. One major downside of this device that actually also affects the flagship z3 (and z5!) is the screen-to-body ratio. The top and bottom bezels on this device are LARGE. This is a phone with a 5"" screen, but it's about a large and unwieldy as my LG G3, which has a 5.5"" screen. It's also quite slick, due to the rounded edges. Nice looking, but not really ergonomic.Yes, this device has a 720p screen. That doesn't bother me, but be aware if that is a problem for you. Performance, on the other hand, is surprisingly ...MEH. The Snapdragon 615, while definitely a mid-range CPU, should really make this thing at least ""feel"" snappy with regard to the interface. However, I really find the whole experience often quite laggy, with poor multitasking, despite the accompanying 2 GB of RAM. Again, at this price point, not a dealbreaker. However, there are many devices on the market using the same processor, and even lower end Snapdragons such as in the 2015 Moto G, which still manage to have very snappy interfaces at the same or lower price.Camera performance is very disappointing. In extremely bright outdoor lighting, you can definitely capture some great STILL shots. Indoors, or with moving subjects, do expect much less than stellar image quality. Furthermore, the camera is unacceptably SLOW. After shooting, expect several seconds to pass before you can take another shot. There's really no excuse for this. Using a third-party camera such as Google Camera or Camera FV-5 are lightyears ahead in speed. I'm extremely confused that Sony considered this performance acceptable, even on a midrange device.NOW, onto my return to Sony. I've had this phone for only a month. Yesterday, the earpiece simply stopped working when making or receiving calls. The speakerphone is still functional, but that's hardly something I could live with, considering the fact I've only had this device for a few weeks. I did my best to troubleshoot, to no avail. Then factory reset the phone. When that didn't work, I tried to chat with an Xperia Care agent who suggested I try some diagnostics in the service menu. No dice. He then insisted that I completely reinstall the system software using Sony's PC Companion software and get back to them if that didn't work. Well, surprise of the year, it didn't solve anything. After chatting with a second Xperia Care rep, I was told I had to CALL for an actual RMA. So, call I did. To my disappointment, I was not even provided a return shipping label with my RMA number. I was furthermore warned several times that if there was any sign of water damage that my warranty would not be honored. Now, there is certainly NOT any water damage to my device. However, for a phone highly touted as waterproof (or at least highly water-resistant), that's just a major turn-off.We'll see how the RMA goes, I guess. I really only bought this device to tide me over while I waited for a Z5, but it served as a pretty good audition! I've decided I definitely do not want another Xperia! At less than half the price of a Z5! I'm always trying to find the bright side, ya know.Sigh...Don't buy this phone. Or do! It's quite inexpensive, at least."
"1979","If you are looking for the dual sim model this is NOT it. I gave this 2 stars because it is not dual sim. Thought it was but had to return it. Other than that it is a lovely phone. Dual sim models are E2333, E2363, E2312. I am now fresh on the hunt for the E2363 16gb."
"1980","Good price & goob phone"
"1981","Very nice, solid performer. My first Android phone. I like it very much."
"1982","Perfect"
"1983","great product, excellent service"
"1984","gave it two stars because the phone is gorgeous. basically i gave this people $200 for a phone that only works okay when plug to it charger, i couldn't have it on me (like normal people) because it burned like hell (LIKE HELL)... when the batterie was ""full"" i had like 12 minutes before that red bar saying put me to charge visited me lol. well i had it for like 3 days and could take it anymore so i sent it back. i didn't want a refund, i was in love with how it looked so i wanted another one (a working one) but lucky me as soon as i turned on the other one (the new one) there was that crazy hot FIRE hot and the 5 minutes battery life (again) .... now that second sony xperia is completely useless (yerterday cleaning my room i saw it thats why im doing this review )....im not saying is a bad cellphone (that i don't know) but at least this one unlocked sony xperia m4 was my NEVER again buying a phone here or ebay experience.....oh it wasnt the uuu my phone is hot feeling NO!, NO!,NO! it was the i can't have this phone on me becasue is going to blow up soon very soon kinda feeling."
"1985","excellent phone."
"1986","Perfect"
"1987","excellent product, 100% recommended"
"1988","This product is actually locked, not an unlocked phone as advertised. The Sony Xperia is a great phone and for the price, it's not a bad Android device. But beware that this phone is actually locked, so you won't be able to use it as a phone, just a wifi device with apps on it."
"1989","it's amazingfall in love with this"
"1990","I bought this as a Christmas gift for my brother. He loves it. I'm glad it's waterproof and dustproof, as he can be kind of clumsy and forgetful at times. I bought an Xperia L two years ago from Amazon, while it still works just fine, it shows its age, and this one makes me want to get a newer one."
"1991","This phone it's great!!"
"1992","bought this phone to go on straight talk plan. bought bring your own phone kit. Been try to get service for all most a mouth now they tell me their signal for gms phone is to weak in my area. phone will not pick it up. have a phone with no service. make sure gms service. is strong enough in your area before buying this phone as it will not work with Verizon or sprint towers and straight talk shows att towers in my area on their maps but are to weak for phone to pick. so my phone was a waste of money because I can not get service"
"1993","I always loved Sony products, but this time it wasn't what i expected. The phone has turned off 3 weeks after arriving and never on again. I would like my money back. the phone doesn't work at all."
"1994","No oleophobic coatingUI lag (my 3 years old Nexus 4 work faster) after flash on another stock rom phone star working better, waiting for Marshmallow 6.0.Slow camera.Everything else +"
"1995","The phone did not start first time. In call option, it does not allow to view before call....it just dials the number. WiFi reception and signal reception is bad. Does not play YouTube videos most of the time. You have to restart it to play YouTube videos. Comes with an awkward charger and earphone."
"1996","Too much expectations"
"1997","Excelent"
"1998","Cheap phone that has very good specs for the price ($150). Very good for parents or people who use the phone for simple things such as calling and web browsing and google features."
"1999","UPDATE: Decreased from four stars to two stars. Reasons:1. As other reviewers have said, this phone heats up. A lot. It will turn off without any sort of warning due to overheating. It's been barely four months since I purchased it and this keeps happening more and more often. At first I thought it was because I was pushing it too far with the simultaneous app usage; but it has collapsed while on stand-by.2. It doesn't hold a charge. Unless you have it perpetually in ""Stamina Mode"", this phone barely gets through the day. I'd say not even 15 hours straight.3. Faulty GPS location. If you buy this phone, be prepared to miss exits and having to stop at the side of the road while it syncs.BOTTOMLINE: Honestly, I'm experiencing all the issues I had with my old Huawei Ascend after 2.5 years of use. I'm even beginning to think I was sold a used mobile instead of a new one. Don't let the stylish exterior fool you, there are better phones within this price range. Don't waste your money on this and buy a Huawei P8 or similar instead.----OLD REVIEW:Sturdy, mid-range phone that does the job without wrecking your wallet.ProsGreat soundLoud speakersGreat graphicsGood enough rear cameraGood reception and superb noise-reductionConsFrontal camera is useless under poor lightTons of pre-installed apps (both google and sony loaded it with their junk)Delayed response (a second or two, sometimes)"
"2000","Great phone.-Fast and very sleek looking.-Screen is good for what the cost.-Pretty good battery life.-Button are clicky and nice to touch.-Great to hold.Not a flagship be any means, but is good overall phone.Have some issues from time to time, when it restarts in sleep mode with data on."
"2001","It's worth the moneyNice look & speedyI love it"
"2002","Got this phone as a gift for my mother and she found it easy to use! Add water proof to the phone and a great camera and you can't go wrong with this phone. The performance is great and it gives her all day battery life! The only downside is that it only has one speaker. Given the price its still a great phone!"
"2003","After almost a month of usage. This is one of the best android phone I used. I don't usually look for extreme performance. I use the smart features in the phone and I like the apps and retouch from Sony"
"2004","Great phone, definitely a Sony customer now"
"2005","I bought this product, use only a month and suddenly the front photo camera stopped working."
"2006","Laggy performance. Restarts occasionally on its own. Definitely has a overheating issue when streaming video or audio. Okay for basic browsing and calls/texts"
"2007","Very cool phone."
"2008","Shipped and received quickly by Amazon. Light and attractive phone. Responsive touch screen. Plastic backing consistent with mid-level make and likely contributes to its light weight. I started with Android system so the transition to this phone was simple via Sony's software and previous backups. Back camera at 13MP was sluggish and had reasonable quality under good lighting; don't expect action shots or quality pictures under poor lighting conditions. Unfortunately, the front camera was nonfunctioning on arrival so I couldn't assess its quality; the good news is that Amazon is great about exchanges. Will update when replacement arrives."
"2009","Excelente"
"2010","Not even two days of battery life."
"2011","received all ok. Thank you very much."
"2012","My battery not holding charge an it keeps blanking off...phone getting hot an freezing up when snapping a picture... Disappointed!!!"
"2013","It does not serve to answer calls when you have several applications open and in useno sirve para responder llamadas cuando tienes varias aplicaciones abiertas y en uso"
"2014","it is such a great phone, i love sony phones but unfortunately could not afford the Xperia Z5 so I purchased this instead. only thing i would say is disappointing is the camera. Quality of photos are okay at best, my Xperia Z1 had a much better camera and I am disappointed with this. Thats the only problem i have"
"2015","I bought the phone on behalf of my brother, he surprise his wife with the phone for Mothers Day. It works great she said! She is very happy with the phone."
"2016","Great at first, but 6 months later and audio doesn't work."
"2017","Got the phone, it is ok. But the screen cracked after a minor drop:( Maybe it was my bad luck"
"2018","Has got heating Issues. Gui could have been much better.Rest works well"
"2019","HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE! This phone malfunctioned and was unusable after only 2-3 months of owning it. I purchased a case and screen protector with the phone and take very good care of it. The phone was under warranty when it completely broke and I immediately sent it off for warranty repair/replacement. Sony Xperia technical support claims that a repaired or replaced phone will be returned to you within 14 business days of receiving the phone. Sony has had the phone for a month now. I have called many, many times to ask for a status update. I was initially told that the status is currently ""a work in progress"" but that they will request more specific information and provide this information to me in 2-3 days. I never heard back and had to call again, to be told AGAIN that it was a ""work in progress"". I have called a total of 8 times since the 14 business days have expired. I was told that this case was labeled to be expedited. Then it was flagged as requiring immediate attention by a supervisor. Still no word.When I last spoke with the supervisor of the call center, I was told that the supervisor had complained to the repair facility about the lack of response from them. However, there was nothing else that could be done. Apparently, there is no phone number for the repair facility in Illinois that either I, or the supervisor at the call center in the Caribbean, can use to contact them. Also, Sony refuses to simply send me a new phone despite the fact that it is well past their policy of 14 business days before the phone will be repaired or replaced.This is horrible customer service to a degree that is hard to put into words. Their system is so inadequate that I can't even explain it all here. There is no oversight and no accountability for totally disregarding their own policy and for the dissatisfaction of their customers. The bottom line is if your Sony cell phone breaks at no fault of your own immediately after purchasing it, you're screwed.Not only will I never purchase a Sony cell phone again, I will avoid all Sony products as there are many competitors with much better customer service on the market."
"2020","I got this with a warehouse deal for $139, at that price this is a great phone.The form factor is durable and attractive, but it is incredibly light. Antenna reception is good (at&t) The screen is not full HD, but the resolution difference is not that noticeable. The battery life is about a day and a half of moderate usage, and the stamina mode is impressive.Under light usage its very snappy and quick but under any kind of demand it boggs down. If I have 3+ tabs open in google chrome with queued videos it will start to freeze. Same goes for when multitasking demanding apps. (in my case torque and chrome).Further, it does not have a gyroscope so no google cardboard.There is also no screen activation without using the physical button (such as swipe up / double tapping the screen).As of 6/14 only android 5.0 officially."
"2021","I was satisfied with this phone. Camera is OK and battery lasts all day long. The problem is I can't make phone calls normally, microphone is not working, the only turnaround is turning on the speakers. It's a software issue related to Android Lollipop, it's not a hardware problem."
"2022","Its a good phone but it's not working in singapore. Its says unlocked but it isn't"
"2023","Ultimate stamina doesn't work can't take out the battery and if u get water in it u can't hear smh a bunch of crap"
"2024","I was really excited and looking forward to using this, but usability is exactly where it falls flat.First, when I run common apps, such as Google Music and Apple Music, the apps will just randomly shut down. There were a few others apps, like Avast, that just would not reliably run. Bottom line, app stability, from major companies, on this phone is bad.Second, the cameras, front and back, are marketed as excellent with good low light performance, but that is just not the case. Low light performance is quite poor, while both cameras suffer from abysmal contrast.Didn't test out the water resistance, so I can't comment on that.Sony just cut too many corners to try and make a budget friendly phone, which lags behind other phones in this range, such as former flagships LG G3 & LG G4."
"2025","Best android phone I've had"
"2026","The Phone just randomly restarts, multiple times a day. I reset it, and have done everything I can think of. I can be using it and all of sudden it will restart. It can also just be sitting on the counter and I look over and it will be booting back up because it has restart it self again. Under Diagnostics it says it has had 108 incidents in past 10 days. I have contacted Sony but they require the phone to be sent in for repair and it can take couple weeks to get phone back. If I can find a backup I guess I will do this but I can not be without my phone. If these problems were known before time I would not have purchased this phone and/or would have returned it."
"2027","Dear Amazon, when I buy this Sony, I used little time, It is not work good, the charge and charged go out in little time and to charge take toomuch time, I no remember the time I buy, and it has Guaranty, I would like to know, it the company it can check, Than Eugenio Toala"
"2028","great"
"2029","Sony makes solid phones. I only wish the battery was removable otherwise an amazing device."
"2030","Incredible phone, perfection at a very reasonable price. Does all one may want a phone to do!"
"2031","Not bad , this phone is really comfortable in the hand and the waterproof feature makes it better. Camera is really good but not so good in low light. For me battery life wasn't the greatest but it does last a whole day . I'm just used to higher batteries on phones . the phone did had some problems running high graphic games and will heat up a lot specially while charging and for that reason I returned it . other than the overheating issue I really liked the phone , I just wish an update can improve the kag and overheating ."
"2032","Good product for the price. Would easily slip from your fingers though. A good solution is to purchase a rubberized case. There's an issue with the camera that I would like to point out though. There were times when I used the camera for video recording but upon playing the mp4 file, all that came out with the sound was a black screen. I thought I had a defective unit but this also happened to my wife's M4 Aqua. A simple work around that I found is to avoid using the stock camera and instead install a different camera app from Google Play store. I've never had the said video problem since.The processor is fast enough for my purposes which include using Google Maps for navigation, shopping, playing videos and playing music. I cannot comment on the overheating issue because I've never had that experience with this phone."
"2033","I love it!"
"2034","Good phone at a great price. I'm coming from a Nokia 635. I really like that phone it was cheap and did everything I wanted it to do. Sure it wasn't great and didnt have a front camera but, Windows phone system was so easy to use. I really didn't want to make the switch to Android but, everyone says I miss alot by not using Android or Apple so I decided to see if I like the Android experience. If I didn't I like it I'd go back to windows phone with my next purchase. I really did my research while shopping for my next phone upgrade. I wanted an unlocked phone that cost around $200 had 16gb memory and microSD. I looked at the Alcatel Idol 3 (4.7 the 5.5 seemed too big), which I almost purchased but, the M4 aqua had a slightly better processor. I really liked the design of the Moto G 3rd gen but it was $20 more for the 16gb version and had a lesser quality processor. So far I've gotten accustomed to Android, or Sony's version of it, and it is pretty easy to use so no major learning curve coming from a Windows phone. The variety of apps are definitely greater, but as a casual user, there really isn't anything new that I am using that I did not use on my Windows phone.The phone itself has a pretty nice screen, I noticed the better quality coming from my Nokia 635. Sure, it doesn't compare with my friend iPhone 6 but, at 200 it doesn't have to. It come with 16gb and I had about 11gb left to use after the OS and pre-loaded apps. Sony advertises 2 day battery life. I have come nowhere near that using it casually. I don't use my phone hard. I check FB, emails, play a game once in awhile. I'm usually down around 30% when I go to bed and that is using battery stamina mode but, that's about equal to most smartphones these days so no real complaints. But I think you'd only get to 2 days if you dont use data, wifi and keep the brightness low, so false marketing on Sony, in my opinion. I noticed some complain the M4 gets hot but, I don't notice any excessive heat. Nothing worse than my old phone. I've not tried to get the phone wet so not sure how good that feature works but, its one less thing to worry about.Main complaints. the speaker. Horrible tiny sound, heck my Nokia 635 had better sound. Little disappointed since Sony should be able to do better. Headphones sound great but, speaker is bad. The camera take adequate shots, nothing great. I'm happy with it so far to post pictures on FB and such. The camera is slow though it takes a long time to take a picture, longer than I think it should take.Overall, I like my phone and should keep me going for 2 years or so until I replace it. I took a star off for the speaker, slow camera and Sony's marketing of 2-day battery life which is almost impossible to get."
"2035","MY phone started having dead screen in the 3rd week of use and screen completely shut down in week 5. Until the last incident, I was able to bring the screen back on by hard reset/manual reboot.1. This phone isn't waterproof. And support will do anything to make sure warranty doesn't cover repair, first thing they ask is , did you put phone in contact with water or damage it? If so, we don't cover it under warranty.. : I told them i have absolutely no damage on the phone and additionally PHONE IS m4 AQUA(WATERPROOF) , insisted them that this has been happening since week 3. They finally told me to make a CALL instead of CHATTING to open a service case, and when i opened the case, the rep told me previous agent I was chatting with wrote that I cracked the phone screen and warranty will no longer cover this device.2. Like I said, shady and DISHONEST CUSTOMER SUPPORT. Google sends a replacement phone for their customers.3. I never had a phone that broke so fast (6 weeks), and I took care of it like a baby...4. Phone is ok, camera is def not good and phone is slow. It takes a while to boot up and even receiving messages. Logging in to applications take like 2 mins on this phone... IDK i wouldn't buy it again...5. Sony will not allow you to make a return. I simply don't want to use a Sony device anymore after this experience I've had and get a Samsung or Google, at least it works. I bought this phone cause it was cheaper than other android phones w same size.Reason i didn't send this phone in week 3 is, Sony has a 14 day period to evaluate is they will cover the repair under warranty. This 14 day period doesnt include shipping and repair time, also they don't send you a label unless u ask for it. And they told me it will take them 48 hours to send me a label. So if your phone broke, you will spend 30 days to get it back, and from their attitude i can tell they do their best to make you pay even if you have a valid warrent.I told them over and over again"
"2036","Heats up freezes. I have less bars than I do when sim is in different phone"
"2037","Best smartphone at this price range"
"2038","Gud"
"2039","I bought this for my mother as she keeps dropping her phones into liquid. She is now getting great reception inside her house using the newly added GSM band 12. Before she would have to be in one specific room and always had a poor signal. With this phone she is able to walk around the entire house and even the basement while having a good signal. The battery life is outstanding as well, she is getting 2.5 days per charge now instead of her previous phone barely making it a day. I'm sure the improved signal has something to do with that.Overall, no heating issues and mom is happy."
"2040","It is a great phone for the price range. Didn't have much complaints on it and it did well for the time I had it. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good budget friendly smart phone"

"2052","Great phone. Highly recommended. Had three iPhone previously and this is better. Only downside is that Apple blocks my group text messages. Easy fix by downloading textra. If you're thinking about switching from iPhone to android you should but read the blogs about group messages first prior to turning off your iPhone."
"2053","Phone was great until the software problems. Tried to repair on my computer and still didnt fix the problem."

"2067","GPS function died within 6 months. Phone is sluggish during routine usage and touchscreen is inaccurate. Battery life has become progressively worse over the last few months, so I'll probably replace it with a flagship device this holiday season when phones go on sale again. I can't really recommend this one for most people. It's ok, I guess...but it's too expensive to just be ""ok""."
"2068","Heats up too often. And it gets very hot for no reason all the time, even when I have nothing opened and locked."
"2069","Phone is BIG and can get really hot under heavy load, battery lasts half day under heavy use (Pokémon GO), otherwise is a great phone for its price. Camera and sound are top-notch."
"2070","Totally disappointed...The camera does not work properly almost all the time. The front camera does not work. I thought it was a dual sim phone but it is a single sim.

"2073","Slow Phone! Looks good, takes good pictures but its slow and the Phone interface SUCKS big time. I am new to android but I ordered a LG G3 for my wife after i ordered this for myself. Gotta say the LG G3 is WAY BETTER than this and also is 32 GB for $20 more!Sony really failed with their Phone interface on this phone, even though it s a smart phone most people still use it to MAKE CALLS, please keeep that in mind SONY and make sure you have a user friendly phone interface on all your phones."
"2074","The speaker stop working for no reason"
"2075","It's an okay phone, I returned it, and got an asus zenphone. My husband still has his Sony phone"
"2076",";)"
"2077","I personally like the Samsung Galaxy phones, but I really like the security of knowing that this model is waterproof. I was led to believe that the camera on this phone was also really good, but it's one of the worst phone cameras I've ever used. It does what I need it to do, but it's not the best phone I've ever had by far."
"2078","extra clear hi def display and feels solid"
"2079","I started using ios a few years ago. After a few years, I got bored of it. So I sold my iPhone and got this (it was on sale for$200). I got it 2 moths back (November 7). First thing, this is an honest review; I am not being paid to review this product.Build quality/ hardware- the phone is 7.3 mm. It's pretty slim and feels sturdy in your hand. The power and volume buttons are weirdly placed at the right middle side of the phone. In my case, this proves to be a good thing because I have small-medium hands. There is one front facing speaker, SD card slot on the left, charging port on the left, micro simcard on the right, a headphone jack on the top, and a camera button on the bottom right( to take photos instead of touching the screen) . The back of the phone is plastic but looks like glass. The back and front of the phone are very vulnerable to scratches; I recommend buying a screen protector and cover. There are no physical home buttons. The phone is water proof, but you should wipe your screen after putting it in water as it tends to become unresponsive when you touch the screen.Software- the phone is pre-installed with Android 5.0 and loaded with about 23 apps of which only around 7 are useful. After deleting apps and cache I had 12 gb left. The skin is very close to stock lollipop android. So far no apps have crashed. Something I found nice is the ability to record your screen when you long press the power button.Camera- I'm not a selfie guy, but alot of people take photos of their duck lips and food so I included this part. The camera is pretty good, but not the best. There are lots of settings to enhance your photo experience. Something I found fun was that is has a virtual reality camera mode that allows you to talk photos/videos of dinosaurs, undersea,etc. A very big setback is its lack of flash. So if you live in a dark cave, too bad. You can zoom in too, but it gets blurry and hard to adjust. Something I found useful is that the camera recognises where you are, so if your driving and taking a video it makes the videos look not blurry.Performance- Im a gamer, and performance is key in every product I purchase for gaming. The phone has 2 gigs of ram and a snapdragon 615. It tends to heat but not as much as lava on your hand. The heating problem is not a big deal. I have 21 games on my phone( no SD card) of which include modern combat 4, Nova, asphalt 8, minecraft, and terraria. These games played pretty well with occasional lag, although it's almost unnoticeable. The phone scored 25841on antutu, single core 527 on geekbench 3, and multicore 1905 on geekbench 3. Decent enough.Conclusion: overall I am very pleased and satisfied with the experia m4 aqua. It has a low price but simply beats others of its price range due to ram,waterproof, snapdragon 615, and good slim build. I would recommend this phone to anyone."
"2080","Loud and deep bass. Treble is fair but mid is weak. But so far is the best for under $100. Really worth for money."
"2081","I haven't had an android in a while. I've had an iphone 4s for about 2-3 years then I switched to this phone. I like this phone because battery is wonderful. I put it on airplane mode while at was at work and it only lost 10% in 12 hours. I wish It had some features that apple has, like seeing if someone read your messages, being able to reply to messages from the home screen. I freaked out one morning because I woke up and it wouldn't turn on even though it didn't die over night. For the price, it's great. Hope it lasts a long time, I don't feel like picking out another phone. I was also so used to the iphone that this phone felt big to me, but honestly it's a pro. I like the screen, everything looks more clear, sleek. Though it does get stuck in some apps, apple has a better processor, it doesn't happen too often so i can let it slide. Could've bought a samsung like everyone else, but my dad already had this phone and I got to experience it for a bit then got to make the decision to get it. Overall, good phone. Coming from an apple phone I just have to get used to it a bit, different features and processor."
"2082","There is a very bad design that once you put your nanosim card in, it is so hard or even impossible to get it out."
"2083","Amazing phone. No complaints"
"2084","It is burning phone. When you do anything, maybe m4 will overheat.But Sony cellphone stay long with short battery"
"2085","Not good"
"2086","Its not very good as its written in descriptions"
"2087","I've been using it about 2 months now and it is getting very ""laggy"". I'm not gifted when it comes to trouble shooting so I'll have to take it to a shop. It seems to ""overheat"" very quickly.I have now had this phone almost exactly 4 months and it has stopped ringing for incoming calls! A Google search indicates that this is a common problem, great. There is a work-around on the internet but I'm going to have to have a geek try to see if they can make that fix, grrrrr."
"2088","Great phone for a great price. Waterproof too? Winner!"
"2089","The phone isn't bad per se but I had an issue with the USB port a couple of months after buying it and Sony's customer service is pretty bad.In the end I would have needed to be without my phone for about 1 month and with no replacement or even guarantee of repairing the issue even though the phone has no signs of misuse and my issue was a clear ""wear"" issue that shouldn't be happening after 3 months of use (warranty is of 1y).Spend some more on a brand that provides good costumer service and that is actually able to provide you with practical and feasible solutions.Don't buy Sony."
"2090","I'm from Hawaii and It didn't work. When I transfer my Sim card it says it's not supported."
"2091","everything on phone worked fine except the microphone when set on headset mode on calls doesnt wanna work, nor when i use it on facebook calling, or ""google now"" voice command, hopefully get a refund for it, its pretty much impossibly for hands-free use"
"2092","Its a great phone however im confused because the description says the battery life is about two days however after fully charging it ; it was about 11 hours until it died, and needed charging again."
"2093","The phone does not provide more than 5hours of battery life in wifi mode and the battery keeps on draining even when stamina or ultra stamina mode is activated. Also the back panel gets heated up during charging or streaming videos or playing music. I am not satisfied at all with this sony product. I had ordered a replacement hoping that the next one would give a better battery life but it turned out to be same. I am going to return this product."
"2094","Great phone!"
"2095","Good features in low cost.."
"2096","Good shipping and item."
"2097","I bought this phone to replace a lumina windows phone because of the lack of apps available. I have had an android phone in the past and I loved it. So did my wife enough said. After seeing so many apps available for android I decided to get this Sony based on reviews. I am extremely happy with my purchase. I have the latest android and I can now download the apps that I want.The audio quality is great, the camera/video is great for a phone. Better than most. The display buttons are larger than the phone I had before, and now I can text almost twice as fast.So do your research think about it, then get this phone. You won't be disappointed."
"2098","Works perfect and arrived earlier than expected :)"
"2099","Good product por the price"
"2100","Heating so fast"
"2101","Phone was heating very badly from back side. After reading I came to know that processor used in this phone has known issues of overheating. Returned next day."
"2102","Ok, but didn't know cannot access battery for replacement if it ever died in the future"
"2103","waterproof"
"2104","The phone is decent at first only real downfall is the speaker volume; however, after 2-3 months expect to have to replace the phone. I bought one on here in December and had to return it within a couple months as the speaker was going out. I thought maybe because it was a damaged box product. However, this is now the second phone that is approximately 2-3 months old and is having the exact same issue. I thought by spending the additional $$ I would save money in the long run because I am a mail lady and light water maybe a problem if I get caught in the rain. However, these phones were never even subject to the rain and yet they lasted less time than the Nokia Lumia's that I had in the past that were cheaper. I would have gotten the square trade warranty however, not available on this product... I wonder why does the manufacturer and vendor know something we don't know?"
"2105","Absolutely Fantastic phone for the money.... I am very shocked at how good it is. It is only running Lollipop but I think that Sony added some customization to the operating system to improve battery life I listen to music for about six to eight hours a day. An I am on the internet quite a bit throughout the day and I still have at least 50% battery left when I leave at the end of the day to go home I am very happy with the camera as I have take pictures for work quite frequentlyThe SONY XPERIA line of phones are most definitely worth the money and buying UNLOCKED from Amazon mean no excess carrier bloatware added that always slows said phones down .Awesome Phone at a awesome price"
"2106","Everything ok"
"2107","Good."
"2108","Perfect! Thank You very much!"
"2109","Awesome"
"2110","Very nice, the battery life is awesome."
"2111","Not what I expected. Not happy whit this purchase."
"2112","Only getting three stars because i have to send back. Really liked this phone, but i got a defective unit that powers off and back on by itself....even with a full charge.might take the difference and upgrade to z3+"
"2113","I don't usually write reviews but after using this phone for a couple of weeks, I feel like it deserves the rating that I am giving. I've been switching from phone to phone for a couple of years now, first owning a windows phone, then samsung galaxy s4, asus zenfone 2, so on and so forth. This is the only phone that I felt was just right. The speed of it was a little slow at first but for some reason it sped up to the point where it is just right now. It comes with bloatware but you can disable it within the settings.One negative thing I really would consider for this phone is that you can't customize between USB connection modes.As everyone says, this phone does burn up, but with its $200.00 price line, this phone wasn't meant for long time gaming anyway. This is a really good practical phone to be using."
"2114","Great phone with great quality"
"2115","Will not buy another[ keeps shutting down ]"
"2116","Great phone for the price range, but there is some noticeable lags now and then. There is one issue with the recording of videos, when i want to view the videos it only shows a black screen with audio only. Restarting the device seems to fix the problem but i don't know if it is permanent. If this issue can be fixed permanently then this phone gets 5 stars :)"
"2117","Bought the phone as a cheap back up and for when we go to the beach or in wet conditions. Set the phone up but could not get the play store to load. It kept crashing so I couldn't install any apps. Returned the phone and got a moto G 3rd generation."
"2118","Do not buy this phone. Battery overheats when taking phone calls causing phone to turn off."
"2119","The phone has an issue thats called the ""sleep of death"". It shuts off for itself and you have to hold the power button and the volume button at the same time to turn it off completely. This happens all the time, sometimes 2-3 times a day. i purchased this in the States and returned to my country so there is no way I can get it changed or repaired."
"2120","Super great phone. Had a note 4 but wanted something water proof after some close calls. Don't miss the note 4 a bit."
"2121","Ecellent cellphone"
"2122","My wife LOVES this phone. She had a Samsung S4 Active before, but it was glitchy. This one works perfectly once you remove all the pre-installed crapware. The screen and camera are way nicer than the professional reviewers say. It does a slide show screen saver thing with your pictures that was a welcome surprise for my wife. I don't like that sort of thing, but she loves it. The phone is amazingly thin. It actually makes me nervous, because it's so thin. But if it can survive this long (a few months) in my wife's purse, then it's rugged enough to survive anywhere. I like to dunk it just for fun."
"2123","Everything was ok"
"2124","Good"
"2125","Do not buy this phone!!!!!!! I bought this phone on Cyber Monday 2015 as of today March 13th 2016 the phone took a dump on me. It keeps shutting off and there is no way to fix it. I contacted Sony and they emailed me a link to download Xperia Companion software to do a software repair on my phone. Well guess what. The phone has to be able to stay on longer than one minute to complete the software repair if that would even help who knows. I did a factory reset and it didn't help. They keep dodging my emails about sending me a new phone to replace this one as it is still under warranty. I heard that sony phones have major issues with overheating and that it causes massive failure with them. I'm assuming this might be the case but I'm not sure. I had a z1 and a z3 before this. z3 was buggy. No wonder all major carriers in the US dropped Sony phones. DO NOT BUY!! You will regret it. I thought some of the bad stuff I was reading were just one off's and that those things only happened once in a blue moon. WRONG!!! Failure is the norm with these phones. You WILL be very frustrated with this phone and have buyers remorse."
"2126","this phone is nothing close to what a Sony phone should be. Its battery is pathetically weak. processing is slow. the original battery charger has already stopped working. it hangs, it becomes unresponsive so many times. its software has a problem, specially video playback hangs very often. Sony support doesn't support. I will not advice anyone to buy this phone."
"2127","I got a good price on the phone after a long customer session.Was one of the most frustrating customer experiences i've had with amazon but they came through so kudos.The phone is a solid device with features we'd expect in every smartphone like waterproofing.Honestly,I got it for people who tend to drop their phone in water and this fits the bill perfectly.P->S Problem solved with experia"
"2128","Excellent Product"
"2129","Everything was good but after some time (20 days or so) it died and it didn't turn on. This was supposed to be my backup phone. Waste of money. It stopped working after the 30 day warranty so i cant return it. great."
"2130","A bit slow and the screen doesn't actually work if there is water on the phone. For me I would never have bought this phone if i would have known that very misleading reviews. If I wasn't out of the country for work I would have returned this Phone. Embarrassing buy."
"2131","I ultimately returned this, it didn't work correctly on my service provider and the camera was terrible.Performance was laggy and it was a fingerprint magnet. I'd skip this. - Try the Blu Studio Energy 2"
"2132","Over heats a lot and its battery dont last 2 days. It last almost 15 hours"
"2133","Excellent"
"2134","Great product, accurate description and reasonable price."
"2135","Had no problems with the phone, does what it is supposed to at a budget price point. I'm only giving it 3 stars as my previous phone was a Z3 and the build and camera quality is a noticeable step down. Probably not fair to compare, but there you go."
"2136","Excellent.!!"
"2137","My sister got this phone and she is not happy with it.I don't know her exact issue... but she just doesn't like it."
"2138","compared to the price of the phone is very good.among the shortcomings is a tendency to run hotter and the camera is not like top models. in the rest of the faults has no problems"
"2139","Returning now- I bought this as a backup to my iPhone which dies when it's cold and has terrible battery life. This one restarts during phones calls, has odd button placement and overheats horribly. Also the cameras are awful. I've had it barely a day."
"2140","Excelente producto."
"2141","This phone, just i love it! :D"
"2142","Great phone. The lowest I've ever paid for a smartphone, yet better than any I have had.Colors pop, great sound from the speaker on the bottom. Came with 16GB of non-volatile memory,has expansion slot for micoSD card up to 128GB. Unless you are a pro photog, the camera is more than adequate.Battery life seems typical of what I have experienced with other phones."
"2143","Great deal! Decent quality phone for the price. This phone lacks a few things that my s5 has, but it makes up for lack of hardware with great Sony software."
"2144","GPS didn't work on the first phone I received, returned for replacement without any issues. New phone works perfectly so far."
"2145","EXCELLENT"
"2146","Phone bricked itself after 5 months. Tried to fix it using several different versions of Sony's software updater to little effect. Stuck on a boot loop... got as far as Sony logo followed by the regular blue wave screen then shuts off and restarts. First update got the Sonly logo with dark back ground shuts off and reboots. Second update after i got a message from sony that there was an update for this phone.. Now it's a white background with the sony logo and it shuts off and reboots. Been too busy to get warranty service got as far as getting an RMA only to have no time (and little access to a printer) and having it expire.The good news is the phone ran fantastic before this. I could not recommend a better phone at this price range. I only write this review because I saw it for the price I bought it for.Update 10/11/2016Tried another new update from sony still stuck on the bootloop. This is just becoming my own fault. I should of made the time to finally get the RMA and return this phone. Meanwhile bought a BLU phone with amazon ads... that one is working almost as good as this one when it was working."
"2147","This phone was terrible. It must no t put out a very strong signal. Had phone service issues for the two months I suffered using the phone. I do not recommend using this phone."
"2148","Excelent celphone"
"2149","buena maquina."
"2150","I'have many problems with the phone, the phone no boot, haw can I replace the item, I'm fromArgentina!!!!"
"2151","Great product. Not watter proof, dont put it under watter. Everything else is pretty cool about the phone."
"2152","The phone cycles on and off as it pleases, and malfunctions quite often, despite not being full or near full on memory space. The battery has quickly become non-existent to the point where I must keep a lipstick battery source attached during the day. If you purchase this phone, also realize that accessories are extremely limited."
"2153","I wanted to like this, but it has too many problems to keep. It's a great size, lightweight and waterproof. However, the battery life on it is horrible when playing games, it drops > 10% in half an hour. Like many other users have mentioned it gets really hot. Games like Bubble Witch crash or lock up when playing for more than 15 minutes."
"2154","Very good phone so far. I'm delighted with it."
"2155","i love this phone, first one they sent me wasnt working, told them, they changed it, and the new one is working perfectly, runs fast enough for me, great camera, lightweight, not to big-not too small"
"2156","Only had the phone a day so keep that in mind when reading this review....My last phone was the Nexus 4. I had it just under 3 years. Great phone. Its lack of LTE bands and limited space (16GB with no SD card) was a problem. Other than that I'd still have the phone. I have no interest in paying the premium for a flagship phone as midrange phones are plenty for my needs. I tried a couple different refurbished phones but each on had problems...I assume because they were used/refurbished. So I knew I had to go with a new phone. I did get the invite for the OnePlus X but canceled my order when I decided that it lack too many LTE bands to be as useful as it could be in the US (really band 4 was the only option). I was thinking about getting a Z3 but even used ones were still way too expensive IMO. So I saw this one.I knew when I ordered it that it was not a flagship phone. It has a 13megapixal camera which is not flagship quality but...its not a flagship. The battery is only 2400+ which is low compared to flagship but...its not a flagship phone. CPU...not flagship quality but... you know.Its not a flagship phone but it is also 1/3 the price of a flagship phone. It offers all the gsm LTE bands you could want (for the US). Its thin. The battery isn't 2 days as Sony says but in the 1 day I've had it I've been impressed (Nexus 4 was smaller battery so this better). Camera is only 13megapixal but its better than the 8megapixal I was use to. Its practically stock android (something I am use to).On a personal note: I like the design of the phone. I never liked the rounded back you get on many phones now a days. I like when my lays on a table that it doesn't rock when you click on the screen. I like the relatively squared corners of the M4. It gives the illusion of a good phone to screen size ratio. I completely understand others might not share these opinions. Its just my preference.For the money its a good phone. For now I'll give it 5 stars as my limited experience has been nothing but great.While I appreciate what flagship phones give you (my Nexus 4 was a flagship phone in its time) and I could afford it if I wanted but what you get for the cost just doesn't out weigh a number of mid-range phones priced in the $~200 range.Edit #1 (1 week):Absolutely no complaints. Its a beautiful phone..especially in its price range. The battery has been absolutely fantastic for my use. I am confident I could get almost 2 days on my normal use. My more significant use (when my son gets his hands on it) does drain the battery faster but I can still get over a day with it. This is the first phone I've had where I know I do not have to plug it in during the day and can probably skip charging every night.Edit #2 (2 months):Fantastic phone. For the money I am shocked how good it is. It is only running Lollipop but I can only assume that the Sony customization to the OS has added something to improve battery life (like what Marshmallow gives you today). When I am at work I probably listen to music (from the SD card) for about 4-5 hours a day. Add in a little internet usage throughout the day and I still have ~60% battery life by the end of the day. As I said before when pushed the phone can drain quickly (son playing lots of games or watching YouTube videos) but for my normal usage this is quite nice for me. My Nexus 4 would not make to the end of my work day without needing to be plugged in if I did the same thing (music and some internet browsing).The camera is? Well the camera itself is quite nice. But the Sony camera software isn't quite right. Its slow. The Android camera app is a definite improvement. So I am not going to change my 5 star review for a slow camera app (that would be silly).I did find one problem though: I had paired my phone with my car (Honda Fit). Everything was working fine for days/weeks. Then one day I realized the car was not informing me of text messages from my phone. Seems the phone had some sort of issue with bluetooth and its saved pairing with the car seemed broken. I had to delete the pairing my phone and car had and recreate the pairing. Its been fine since then. Not sure what happened or what caused the issue but all seems fine now. I suppose if I could do 4.5 stars I'd consider lowering my review but since I cannot I am sticking with 5 as I think it is better that 4 stars. Plus....its possible my car was the problem and not the phone (but I did not have this problem with my previous phone).Anyways....love the phone."
"2157","Great phone. Used it for about a month and have no problems. Battery lasts all day even with high usage. Only have 1 app that won't work because the company only has it available for IPhone or Samsung. Just had to get a different SIM card from my service provider to get started."
"2158","Nice looking phone, but Sony sucks. Their quality control is completely ridiculous and constantly send out defective phones. The mic will work 2/5 times on this phone even while doing the diagnostic test."
"2159","I got this phone to replace a broken LG G4 and I have to say it's a decent mid-range phone.Pros: Waterproof Sleek design Decent headset audio and speaker volumeOverall decent performance. Excellent battery life with stamina mode on, even with LTE. I got nearly four hours screen on time.2GB RAM is enough for multitasking.Seamlessly transitions from LTE to 3G to 2G depending on coverage area. Downloads are super quick on LTE (Panama's 10x10Mhz 700Mhz Band 28 LTE went as fast as 50mbps/20mbps dl/ul) Micro SD card support up to 128GB.Bootloader can be officially unlocked and there is a small custom ROM community on xdaCons: Can get laggy with games. Display is not as good as the Z3 seriesCamera quality is so-soGets a bit hot with extended use though it cools quickly.No double tap to wake like on the Z3 series.Comes with useless bloatware installed,luckily some of it can be eliminated.Overall. I'm happy with it for now."
"2160","As always Sony is ahead of the pack of phones I have ever owned. I had several Sony's in a row and due to budget and carrier restraints I had a Windows phone for 6 months. Well I am back and while it is not the newest and best Sony offers it is by far more amazing than other phones I have tried from friends and relatives.The specs may be lower but it is to be expected from a mid-range phone after all. Honestly for me it is on par with the high range phones I had previously from Sony's Xperia line.If you are tired of waiting for the latest and greatest from one particular company who shall remain nameless, BUY A SONY AND GET MANY OF THOSE FUNCTIONS NOW RATHER THAN WAIT 1-3 YEARS FOR THEM TO CATCH UP.Yes, there is a heating issue with the phone, but logic just tells you if it is heating up too much it is time to put the phone down and get back to life.As for apps all my old favorites load perfectly well and several I was waiting to try are beyond amazing on this phone. Something I definitely could not say for my few apps on my Lumia phone prior to this.Essentially if you are looking for an amazing phone that will provide you with all the features and apps you need and have become used to having on Android, pick up this phone and support SONY as they have truly innovative products on the market.The SONY XPERIA line of phones is definitely worth the money and buying UNLOCKED from Amazon mean no excess carrier bloatware that slows the phone and makes any amazing phone seem to be a letdown."
"2161","I have had the phone for a couple of weeks. Got it on a pre-black Friday sale for $199. For the price-point, it is a pretty good phone. The processor is pretty quick and it has 16GB memory with the capability of adding a microSD to expand an additional 128GB. I have a 32GB card in mine. It can free up space by transferring apps and files to the microSD with a touch of a button. That is a nice feature that my LG did not have. It also has the auto-screen brightness adjustment which isn't always offered in phones at this price-point. I have had a bit of a learning curve switching to Sony from LG, but it hasn't been too bad. My apps didn't all load automatically when I logged on with my Google account, which was a bit of a pain. (And one app was no longer available, so I lost that one entirely.) I haven't tried the headphones, but the Bluetooth works fine with my car stereo. The camera has all kinds of special features that I will most likely never use (like adding an animated dinosaur to your pictures). It seems like a pretty decent camera so far. Calling and texting work well. I did have to manually enter my APN settings for Net10, but that was simple enough. My daughter ended up getting one of these phones as well."
"2162","Phone instantly started overheating as soon as I turned it on and began to set it up. Horrible."
"2163","Great phone, good price."
"2164","Pros- Thin. Is water resistant.Cons- Weak radios for wifi and LTE signal strengths weaker than $25 Moto G. ""Skips"" during playback of MP3 files-- that is just downright pathetic! Comes loaded with all kinds of Sony bloatware. Slow loading apps. Slow switching apps. Slow loading Chrome and Maps.About me: I'm a old school nerd. Was born with a silver AT 286 in my mouth.I do NOT recommend this phone."
"2165","Very speed"
"2166","Ok! It works very well!"
"2167","The Sony Xperia M4 Aqua is an excellent device for those on a budget looking for a good Android phone. Although, the first phone I received would keep powering off on its own. But I contacted Amazon about the issue, and they sent me a replacement. This phone has all the features as other smartphones, but still maintains its low price. The front, and back cameras are both very clear. The flash on this Sony phone is bright and gives you the right lighting to take capture every moment. The phone features excellent speakers to listen to music. Watch a movie, or anything else you want. I would recommend this phone to anybody looking for a nice smartphone, that isn't crazily priced."
"2168","The phone is charging and I am very disappointed. What can I do I just bought the phone"
"2169","The phone itself is great. No noticeable lag other than starting the camera.Although the phone might be pretty awesome for the price IT IS NOT COMPLETELY WATERPROOF! I've been trying to get a hold of customer support, but being like most customer support they don't help for s***!Good phone for the price but sony lies about being waterproof."
"2170","just love it!"
"2171","The microphone and speaker stop working"
"2172","This phone took two months intell it started to miss up the phone itself looks nice but it gets hot fast it started to make calls by itself and apps would just open by there self it pisses me off bad that It does this I wish I can get my money back."
"2173","MY husband loves it"
"2174","All time is super heated, sometimes does not turn, I have to reset it, and rear camera does not work, shows Error"
"2175","I recently bought this cell phone, it was supposed to come unlocked, but no, this completely blocked. The google account is blocked surely with another person's password, Please I need HELP!!!"
"2176","I bought this product on january 2016 as new. I had an issue with my Sony Xperia M4 recently. I dropped it in water however it said that it is waterproof it is not working anymore. So I went to a Sony technical service and they opened it, then they realized that the cellphone was not new.I feel that I was swindled, because I paid for a new product but instead I got one refurbished one."
"2177","This is a review on both the product and Sony's service. Four months after I bought it the screen was having issues. A vertical band of dead pixels on the right side of the screen. Sony received the RMA shipment on May 25th. Their service terms claim a 15 business day turnaround time. Till date they have not been able to tell me when I would receive the repaired phone. Calls and chats with customer service department end with -- "" we don't have any information at this time. Contact us next week..."". I would have been better off returning the phone to Amazon."
"2178","Just as expected, a good phone with good specs and great durability. It's been used everyyday in a professional kitchen setup, subject to splashes, fat and heat without a glitch"
"2179","good price for smartphones. gave this phone for my in laws, she is using it everyday."
"2180","Don't know if it's the phone it self or if the seller got a bad batch to sell but this phone is absolute worst,from it not being waterproof to the battery getting ridiculously hot to it not even charging the way it should anymore and all of these problems are only after a couple of months of use"
"2181","don't buy. this phone suffer from Sudden death and the Sony support its the worst.No lo compre se apaga y no vuelve a prender el servicio de sony apesta es el peor te mandan de un lado a otro."
"2182","nice phone, recommended"
"2183","I've tried Samsung, HTC, Motorola and this Sony is by far the most superior phone I've ever had. This model is mid range ,I can't imagin what a top of the line Sony would be like.Xperia fan for life"
"2184","Great phone - except battery life is awful. Phone, hardware and operations is, in my opinion, great so much that I continue to use this phone despite its short battery life. and for the price I paid (amazon holiday sale $150) I cant complain a bit"
"2185","This worked great when I first got it but after a few months I started getting problems with the speaker and charging port. I will not be buying this again."
"2186","Excellent phone. Probably the best phone I ""ve ever have for this kind of money...."
"2187","This is my third Sony phone in 15 years. Couldn’t be happier. Lot of my friends like this phone more than their iPhone. What else can I say."
"2188","nice!"
"2189","I bought this when my Xperia z3 for TMobile screen broke for the third time. Figured I'd just buy a new phone. Didn't want to buy a current gen for $700 so I figured this next-up gen would be better. All I really want in a phone was that it was water proof(resistant now) and had a good battery. The z3 fit that bill easily so I thought the m4 would too. Everything about this m4 is less responsive than the z3. Touchscreen feels different/less responsive and apps loading/switching is less responsive. But hey, for the price it's not bad and it definitely fits what I'm looking for. Battery lasts forever on moderate usage and dunking it isn't a problem. Just wish it was better than the last generation."
"2190","Worst phone ever had in life. Speakers are not working. Really waste for money. Is this possible to exchange the phone by any chance. Please advise"
"2191","Can't go wrong for the price. Good phone. VERY waterproof."
"2192","The Battery dies quickly, and takes ages to charge, more than 12 hours for a full charge. The microphone stopped working after 2 months of purchase. The speaker is the worst, you can barely listen at people The camera takes horrible pictures and using the flash you only see big giant white stains"
"2193","Great device"
"2194","excellent cellphone just a bit overheat when using it full"
"2195","This is Ok mobile, worth for the price. But as many reviews said it has heating problem, On start when all applications starts- Mobile gets heated very quickly. But Good part is over the time in a minute or 2 it gets cool down.Heating problem is probably because of its Water proof feature. Since all body is air tight, very space for air ventilation inside."
"2196","I switched from lumia 521 to this phone. Things that I missed are: 1) double tap to wake up the phone, 2) built-in call block feature, 3) longer battery life.This phone has a lot of Google bloat ware that cannot be uninstalled. It's taking up a lot of memory space. The phone gets very warm during prolonged use and charging.The most disappointing things are battery life and no call block feature. I have to install an app that adds to depleting the battery.In conclusion, this higher priced phone did not perform as well as my old lowest end lumia Windows phone. It is disappointing and way below my expectation."
"2197","I've been a Sony user my whole life and I'm usually pretty pleased with them. Sony phones are super user friendly and I usually just like the overall quality of their phones, but this phone is a game changer! I feel like this is the most luxurious phone I've ever held! I take lots of pictures so the first thing I played with was the camera, and I started to get worried because I read reviews it wasn't that great, but I think its wonderful. It does very well in low light and it seems to fit more into the picture, it also has cute editing settings for those who like to play with pics. It set up very quickly and I was able to update and download all my old apps that I liked in a reasonable amount of time. I heard phone calls were quiet but I made a few phone calls and played with ringtones and they seemed loud enough to me, the dimmest brightness setting is still very bright, and I was able to send and receive mms very quickly which is something I've found to be on the slower side with Sony phones. I have yet to test just how waterproof the phone is but based on videos and other reviews I've read I'm betting it'll hold up through anything I could/would ever put it through. The phone took just under 2 hours to fully charge and it actually does last 2 days! I put it through at least 12 hours of internet streaming and made phone calls and texts before needing to charge it again at the end of the second day, also I had like 12 apps running at once before I decided to close them all and you'd never even know all those apps were running it was so fast! I definitely recommend this phone to anyone looking into it."
"2198","A good phone."
"2199","Very good phone! Even though the camera was broken so i returned it! And bought another one from other brand! Anyway the phone is very fast and has a good size like the xperia z3! I love the fact that is waterproof even though i could never experienced it. I would recommend is you are looking for a budget phone this one will work just fine"
"2200","I love it"
"2201","Great product."
"2202","A good phone!"
"2203","I really like the phone but unfortunately my tmobile sim does not fit on it. Too bad I have to return it."
"2204","Love it, it's fast slim, and very sleek. The only down side is that it's slippery."
"2205","this product must be defective i plugged i in to charge and thought it was gonna caught fire. returned it immediately still waiting on my refund"
"2206","I am very happy with my cell phone. Beautiful and friendly"
"2207","We've had this phone for 3 months or so, and it just decided to completely quit working. In the middle of the day, it shut off and now refuses to turn back on (the battery was at 60%).Aside from the fact that it no longer works, we were having trouble with various aspects of the phone. It would constantly switch networks in the middle of calls and then hang up on the person you're talking to. Additionally, the battery life *might* be good for 12 hours, and the GPS does not work---it updates two or three miles after you've missed the turn."
"2208","Update: the phone has been under repair by sony for 6 weeks, ""waiting for parts"" with no information on when it will be sent back. That makes nearly 3 months of repair time in 7 months of ownership. This phone has gone back twice, and my daughter's Z3 Compact has gone back once for the side charge port coming off, and been fixed a second time by me for the same issue, along with a new back, which spontaneously shattered while sitting on a car seat about 1 week after the warranty expired.Well, I bought this phone for $200. But it is really a $400 phone since you have to buy 2 of them. One to use, and one to send back for repair. Actually a fine phone when it works. First phone had the screen fail after a few months, now replacement has the microphone and earpiece fail a few month later. A smart phone kinda needs a screen and a microphone and speaker. Like I say, just buy 2."
"2209","Not the best quality. Doesn't really protect the cell phone, just by scratches."
"2210","I have had overheating and shut off issues ever since I purchased this phone, but I sucked it up. In December a software update prevented the phone from restarting continually when it overheated. However, it still, overheated. In March the phone died. It Refused to charge it just gave up the ghost. I sent it to Sony for repair and one month later still no phone. It is impossible to speak with anyone at the repair center and the customer service is equally hopeless. My advice is to keep your money. If you are ever unfortunate enough to need a repair you will be on your own."
"2211","Here is why. It arrived, I charged it, got it to the store and activated my sim for it with my plan, the problem with this phone is it constantly restarts. I've tried several things and no luck. Every time it updates an app or downloads something, it restarts. Your in the middle of doing something, it freezes for about 5 seconds... then restarts. It sits there and I'm not even using it, you guessed it, restarts. Also it gets hot, even after 1 minute of use. That is very irregular. I finally gave up after the third time it went unresponsive and black screen. Last night it ""stayed on"" somehow with a black screen and overheated. The battery was depleted when I woke and it was very hot. DO NOT GET THIS PHONE."
"2212","So I've always been bad lucky with Blackberry and Blu. My first time owning a Sony Phone. Was super amazed that it was water proof. Threw it in water last night for couple minutes and its still up and running. Can't go wrong with this phone. Its cheap plus have amazing specs. My only wish is that I got the dual SIM version."
"2213","Great!"
"2214","phone is very sleek and attractive. very light in the hands.. set up was a cakewalk.. android 5.0 preinstalled. pretty quick response time .. overall impressed with this phone. has gotten a little warm with heavy use but nothing extreme like noted in some of the other reviews, completely happy with my choice.. my last phone was a galaxy s4 active. so to still be impressed.. it says alot. i would so make the same decision again"
"2215","very good"
"2216","Love it. It's awesome for a $200 phone! It is waterproof. It works with any network that uses Sim cards. It does get warm when the processor gets going like other reviews state, doesn't affect operation. Camera is okay. The warranty is badass. The screen cracked and they replaced it immediately."
"2217","The phone itself is OK. It heats up too quickly. The worst part is Sony's Xperia Protection which rendered my phone useless and bricked it. If you purchase this phone don't use this feature."
"2218","Very good!"
"2219","Unfortunately this phoneis giving me tons of errors since the beggining, now the camera is not working, the has never been dropped I wrote to Sony looking for an answer but they didn't reply, I bought this phone on December 2015. I feel ripped off!"
"2220","You get what you pay for has some issues bit price was right"
"2221","Love this phone for my daughter"
"2222","Excelent price. It's a good Android Phone, not the top but good enough."
"2223","My husband truly did like his new phone. Price was terrific when I bought during a flash sale, I think. He likes the phone... and I didn't have to spend three or four times as much on a phone. T-Mobile sim bought with it was perfect, too."
"2224","Pros+Good Looking Design+Good Performance+Waterproof+MicroSD Expansion+Good Camera+Android Pay CompatibleCons-Okay Screen-Average Speaker-Average Battery Life-Decent Performance-Not the only good phone availableShould you buy: YESActual Value $200Sony has made a lot of great, if a bit too frequent, phones. With a waterproof design and glass construction, it has a great record of making phones. However, those phones had competition from Samsung, LG, among others that made it difficult to stand out. Sony, however, has decided to aim for the midrange market by making this: the Xperia M4 Aqua. In 2014, I would’ve recommended this phone instantly. However, in 2016, is it still a good buy among the rest of the excellent lineup of 2015? That is what I tried to find. In short, it is a good phone. But that leaves me conflicted as to where to place this phone in the current state of the market.-Design-Any similarities with any of the phones in the Xperia lineup is no coincidence. In fact, that is kind of its selling point; it doesn’t look like other phones in this price range. The glass found on the front and back is beautiful and feels premium in the hand and from any distance it looks like a much pricier phone. The Sony and Xperia label add a bit of class to this otherwise good looking budget phone. This also makes it a bit disappointing to find a plastic frame instead of a metal one that is found on its older brother. But considering its price, this is something that can be forgiven. In the hand, it feels light enough to easily carry but dense enough to feel like it won’t break easily. That being said, I recommend buying a case immediately in order to prevent any part of the glass from shattering. The front grills on the phone are nice, but they are a bit deceiving. The speaker, unlike the other Xperia, is actually on the bottom of the phone. The top one is an earpiece for calling and the bottom one is a microphone. There is also your typical power and volume rocker, along with a two-stage button. This last button that should be in all phones and I’m surprised that it is a rare thing to find these days. Overall, it is a good looking phone that should make most people happy.-Performance-The specs on this phone are good for the price. It is packing a Snapdragon 615 with 2GB of RAM, 720p display, Android Lollipop, and microSD card expansion. In benchmarks, the phone runs just above the Alcatel Idol 3 (4.7) but a great distance under the Samsung Galaxy S5. It is a respectable score for the price. However, it is a bit confusing in general use. It is snappy most of the time with general day to day task. But sometimes the bloatware that Sony adds to the phone makes it stutter a bit, particularly when multitasking a lot of apps. It never slows down completely or enough to get in the way, but it is noticeable. Most games, or any other graphic demanding app, do run well on this device without an issue with only the heaviest of games stuttering a bit. Apps also run smooth while they are open and even when going back to it while multitasking. In my practical testing, I can open up to 5 apps without any of them closing, including Chrome, Snapchat, YouTube, Amazon app, and Instagram. Signal quality, for the most part, is good. There are a few areas in my area of Los Angeles where I get a weaker signal than what I’ve experienced with OnePlus and Alcatel, but they are minor issues. My top speed running on the T-Mobile network was 54 Mbps download speed and 7 Mbps upload. Call quality is also good from both ends of the call, with both earpiece and loudspeaker providing loud volume and above average quality. While it does have the hardware to use Band 12, it is unable to use it since it doesn’t meet the requirement from T-Mobile. But it still performs well and should be great for most people.-Display-The phone has a 1280 x 720 HD display with a pixel density of 294 ppi. While on paper that does look like a lower level of pixel density than other phones it’s actually good enough for most people, with text looking slightly fuzzy when holding the phone right up close. Colors are good, but not excellent. They are good enough, but next to something like the S5, OnePlus, or even the Alcatel Idol 3 the colors look a bit washed out. The white balance is slightly towards the blue side, but it isn’t that noticeable. Thankfully, Sony does allow for tweaking the display settings should you want to make it good. Contrast and brightness levels, on the other hand, are great and they do allow for it to be usable in direct sunlight. Only thing I have of concern is the glass on the display. I have not found a confirm report as to what the glass is (Gorilla Glass, Dragontrail); the only thing I have found it to be listed as is “scratch-resistant glass.” Just something to keep in mind. Overall it is a decent screen, but there are better options available.-Camera-Sony has a reputation for making quality camera sensors, such as the iPhone and other flagships, so I was expecting some of that tech to drop down to their midrange phone. The result is good, but not much more than that. It comes equipped with a back-facing 13MP camera and a front, wide angle 5 MP camera. I couldn’t find any specific information on the sensor in the back, with Sony limiting themselves to only saying it is a Sony Exmor RS model, but no specific requirement in particular. Since there is no other phone that we can identify with this sensor, we’ll have to judge it independently with other phones in this price category. So, is it good? In general, yes. Photos taken in bright light come out excellent and the phone does focus quick on the subject or background that is being exposed. Colors are a bit lighter than what they are in real life, but it’s not a deal breaker. Low light is surprisingly good for the price. Sure, it isn’t up to the level of an S6 or a G4, but it is above what most other phones can deliver. The phone does suffer from motion blur, so nighttime shots are best left for tripod or steady hands. In short, it is a decent camera perfect for social media.-Software-The Xperia M4 comes with Android Lollipop 5.0 with some extras that range from good to completely useless. The phone has a custom Sony skin that would look okay if the other apps that you had look similar. But their round shape and overall design contrast to all the other apps that you might download. In addition to this, there are also apps that I wish Sony would make downloadable if needed, but removable if not needed. Apps such as XPERIA Lounge and Playstation Video are useless for me since I don’t have a Playstation and other such as Sketch and AR effect are fun, but ultimately just gimmicks. There are also a few small apps that can be used while using another app, for example the browser, a timer, and a calculator. There are also some small apps that can be downloaded from the Play Store, but you still can’t use any apps. Everything else works similarly to stock Android, with performance being much better if there hadn’t added some annoying bloatware to the mix. The good news is that Sony promises an update to 6.0 Marshmallow for 2016, so that is a positive note. Sony did a good job, but I can’t help but wonder it if could’ve been better.-Waterproofing and Extra Notes-Now, on to this phone’s highlighted feature: the water resistance. Just a little bit of information that you should know: Sony never directly states that it is completely waterproof. They even advise against putting it completely underwater. Nevertheless, it is good on its promise of being water resistant. Placing it underwater for 20 minutes completely submerged didn’t harm it and listening to music in the shower worked great. I wouldn’t recommend doing it constantly, but it does give reassurance that water will not kill it. Something I do want to note is that this phone heats up rapidly even when just going through simple web browsing. Also, the battery does not give 2 days of battery life. The power saving modes do help with battery life, but the most I’ve gotten in general use is one day with 4 hours of screen on time. It is good, but nowhere near the 2 hours it claims.-Conclusion-Here is where I have trouble with this phone. Independently, it is a really good phone with good performance for what it is in addition to a beautiful design and waterproofing that gives users the confidence to have it in the rain. However, there is currently a lot of competition that makes it hard to recommend this phone. For starters, if you want the best bang for your buck, there is the Blu Life One X with a better screen and similar design for less money at $149. If you want a compact phone, there is the Alcatel Idol 3 4.7 at $179 which is still a good phone that is lighter. If you want the looks of the M4, what’s wrong with the OnePlus X, which has a much better screen, much more power, and looks almost the same at a slightly higher price of $249? Honestly, any of the above options are great and they are cheaper than the M4. If you really need the waterproofing, then this is one of your cheaper options and definitely the one to get. But for everyone else, the other options would probably be better."
"2225","The phone has some performance issues. It does not automatically connect to known WiFi connections and there are audio issues where it has difficult switching between headphones, to Bluetooth to normal use. Each time this happens a factory reset appears to correct the issue, but clearly that is inconvenient."
"2226","Love this phone! Nice camera, nice design, feels and looks expensive. I get 4g LTE with tmoblie."
"2227","All I can say is WOW! This is a great phone, I don't know about the comments regarding the camera quality, it blows my S5 and Nexus 5x away. Have not had any over heating issues either but I'm not running a bunch of apps at the same time. Works great on Tmobile network. Wait for it to go on sale and for the price it can't be beat."
"2228","OK👌"
"2229","Had this for about 3 weeks now. Phone works without any problems, no heating up but battery life is not as described. I love the phone still though."
"2230","I'm an Iphone user who purchased and set this up for my mother in law. I have used android tablets, so I have a general familiarity with them. I was impressed with this phone, which has a nice screen and everything functions quickly. I was also impressed with the versatility/configurability of android, as this was my first real time spent setting it up. For the money (I got it on a flash deal for $149) I don't think you can beat this device.UPDATE: 3/20/2016For those who've suffered heat or battery life issues, or the ""sleep of death"", I also had this problem, which is highly frustrating. However, these issues resolved for me by using the Sony PC companion software. You have to connect the phone to the computer and in the PC Companion, press start under Support Zone > Start under update phone software > repair phone. Then follow the on screen instructions in the program. Since I did this (a month ago) I've had no further problems and it's been a fantastic phone."
"2231","Thanks, very good"
"2232","I have an LG G3 in RMA. It just resets on its own. I needed a spare phone and was considering a BLU phone until I found this at 50% off the MSRP. This was a lucky impulse buy which I got at the right time.The phone was the E2306. This thing has T-Mobile's HSPA+ (3G) 1700 MHz frequency (not common) for unlocked phones. It also has LTE bands 2,4,5,12,17 which are the majority of T-Mobile and AT&T frequencies.The phone is pretty slick. I love the aesthetics. It feels dense though. I fear if I drop it, it will break.I had a Nexus 5 (32GB) and LG G3 (32GB) before this phone. So I will use them as references.First item to compare… the screen size and resolution. This phone has the smallest size of the 3 and the smallest resolution of 1280 x 720 (HD). Nexus 5 was a Full HD phone and the LG G3 is a Quad HD. I do not feel that I am missing anything with the lower resolution. How small do you need your text? Everything appears to be crystal clear.Next is the RAM… This has 2GB to match the Nexus 5, and 1GB less than the LG G3. I did not see this phone slow down. I have not been playing any games. I have not been using it at its fullest limit.Next is the storage… this phone has the smallest of the 3 phones with 16 GB. So, this will limit the number of apps you can use and install. I saw this limit on a Samsung tablet and I believe this is the greatest detractor. Now, this also has an MicroSD slot. This is something that the Nexus 5 does not have. So potentially, you can store more pictures and music in this device. The LG G3 wins hands down with 32GB internal with MicroSD card expansion slot. As a spare phone, this Xperia M4 is perfect for me. This could be my daily driver if my LG G3 cannot be repaired. (I no longer have the Nexus 5).NFC… all the phones have NFC, and Bluetooth, Wi-Fi wireless N also included.Battery… the battery is not user replaceable. This was the flaw with my Nexus 5 and why it needed to be replaced. The LG G3 wins this factor with a replaceable battery.Processor speed… This is the slowest on paper but it is future proofed with a 64-bit processor. Although it is an Octo (8) core, it is more like 2 quad cores switching between the two. I do not think I am missing the power. It is still as smooth as the other phones.Speaker… The Nexus 5 and this phone has roughly the same location. The LG G3 speaker is on the back. Of the 3 phones mentioned, this has the BEST SPEAKER phone volume and SPEAKER for music.Camera… This has a 13 MP camera. IT IS THE BEST CAMERA OF ALL 3 PHONES NOTED. I have not taken a blurry picture with this phone. It is slower than the LG G3 and about the same speed as the Nexus 5 in taking pictures, but it is worth it for the quality.Waterproof… need I say more. The LG G3 and the Nexus 5 are not. So, I can put this under the sink faucet and wash my phone. This is probably a major reason that the battery is not user replaceable.Other items to note:1. This phone uses a Nano-SIM. This is the smallest of the 3 phone SIM card form factors.2. The native messaging app stinks! Sony dropped the ball on how it handles group SMS/MMS and organizing the received messages on the group. Sony splits ALL the received messages and sending a group MMS requires a subject. Unfortunately, all the replies are still on separate strings. Get another app, like Google Messenger, Textra, Evolve SMS, etc. With all the benefits of this phone, I could not rate this phone below a five star."
"2233","I am very satisfied, I exceeded my expectations, excellent cost-benefit."
"2234","phone is great except that the camera doesn't work with several third party apps. Of course, neither Sony nor the app developers have been helpful. I suspect it has to do with support for the specific camera hardware, and I don't expect it to be resolved anytime soon. otherwise a great Android phone."
"2235","The first time I put the phone under water the microphone stopped working on calls. I disabled the secondary mic that is for noise suppression and now the main mic seems to be working on calls but the quality is poor. This is a disappointment for a phone with ""aqua"" in the name. The battery life is terrible. It often lasts less than 12 hours. Sony customer support was worthless as usual. Now I have to send it in and be without a phone for 2 weeks. But seriously, it's a $200 phone, so what do you expect."
"2236","It get's hot easily not like red hot but is uncomfortable also poor camera quality"
"2237","I purchased this phone when the price first dropped to $200 on Black Friday. I figured this would be an upgrade to my damaged Nexus 4, rather than repairing it. The great part of this phone is that it had more RAM, drive space and a seemingly faster processor. Plus that fact that I could add an SD card and was waterproof was a bonus.Upon use I immediately noticed that the octa-core processor would heat up the phone very easily, to the point that it would be hot to touch. I use this for everything, from setting appointments, sharing files across apps, playing Candy Crush, running with RunKeeper and playing music, using Waze/Google Maps and posting on Facebook. It acts fine with using one app at a time, but crashes, overheats and slows down completely when multitasking. This is VERY frustrating when I'm trying to make a call or quickly set up directions for navigation.On the plus side, I am happy that it is waterproof. I went running last month, and during the last quarter-mile, I got stuck in a rain storm. Did not affect the device at all.Beside the fact that it has more storage that is also expandable, my Nexus 4 with less cores and less memory easily out-performs this phone. Hopefully the Z-series of this phone is much faster, else I may have to get the more expensive Samsung S series phones to solve my frustrations."
"2238","I bought this phone in Aug of 2015 and I still love it. It has everything that I need and want with a phone. It takes decent photos, and is just the right size for me. I did almost run out of space on it once but the problem was easily resolved by uploading all of my pictures to google drive and then deleting them from my phone. As mentioned by some other reviewers it does heat up sometimes but this is rare and has never been a real problem. The battery life is good, for me itusually last a couple days unless I am constantly using my phone. I did take some pictures with it while standing in a creek where the phone was exposed to some water, not completely immersed, and it was fine. The phone looks really nice and sleek and like I said is the perfect size for me I am 5'4"" and I don't like the huge phones. At the same time the screen seems really big when I am watching something on the phone. I have had the phone almost a year and have had no hardware or software problems. I am so happy I found and bought this cell phone it has definitely met and exceeded my expectations and I only paid a little over 200 dollars for it. I will probably replace it when it is really outdated but it will be hard to part with! I definitely recommend this phone if you are an android person."
"2239","Bought for my wife. She takes a lot of pictures with her camera and this works perfectly for her. The phone part is also nice. I have a Sony and like it very much. Bluetooth with my Sony TV"
"2240","Excelent phone at a good price !! Recomended 100%"
"2241","After having this phone for a few months now, I've found much less to like about it than when I originally got it.Performance is god awful, I dont do a lot on my phone other than basic social media and google play in the background pretty regularly and that already taxes the phone pretty hard to the point I felt like my Nexus 4 was faster (which came out a couple years before this phone did)Battery life is advertised for 2 days under light load which is respectable but I havent seen even near that, if you're constantly using 4G LTE data for even just web browsing the battery drains very quickly and you'll be lucky to see 6 hours on a full charge... charging speeds are decent for micro usbthe camera must be defective for mine because it doesnt seem to focus at all, everything I try to take a picture of looks blurry and it takes forever to snap...Conclusion... Its not a bad phone for 200 bucks but the more I use it the more I wish I just lived without a phone for a bit longer and bought something better."
"2242","I love it"
"2243","Excelent price, excelent hardware and price... great phone...."
"2244","i was very happy to purchase this phone was really fast shipping thanks to amazon butt very disappointed after i receive camera failure afer 2 pictures and going very very hot top back of the phone see picture i was big fan of sony butt very disappointed with this product I'm going to returning thanks as amazon costumer"
"2245","Heats up like hell. Cant hold to the face. This is the behavior right out the box. Wished had opened it sooner to send back. (Sigh)"
"2246","Over heating and restarts on it own several time in a day. I bought this afyer my experience with z3. As a second for my house hold use. Cobtiuesly having issues of restart regardless of uninstalling lot of apps and running with n dafe mode for a while. I always think Sony is good because t thisnone failed. May be next time I should think or wait till get a good review on new phones."
"2247","Good design but it slow compared for the price range"
"2248","The Phone turns off everytime i don't use it... And the unic way to turns it on is pressing the emergency ""off"" button... I think this product was broken because that price... I want a refund of my money."
"2249","Great phone"
"2250","My son loves this phone. It is fast enough to handle games and daily tasks. The screen is clear and responsive. I can't attest to the water resiliency as he bought a case for it to protect it. I highly recommend. It worked great with the Straight Talk Sim card I purchased here on Amazon for a discount."
"2251","awesome phone"
"2252","MIC/SPEAKER STOPPED WORKING 2 WEEKS AFTER THE 30 DAY REFUND/RETURN PERIOD!!!!"
"2253","excelente"
"2254","This is an good phone for the price you pay for it with a fluent minimalist interface that I like much more than other Android customizations, like TouchWiz. My only complaints would be that sometimes the colors of my photos are a little bit opaque for my taste and that, although the phone has a good battery life it is far from the two days promised by Sony."
"2255","Awesome! Good quality & affordable price! Thanks Sony!"
"2256","Great!!!!"
"2257","Reading online this seemed like my perfect phone, it had the power I needed and compact and stylish. I'm not a power user by no means I only play a couple of games that my Moto G can handle well and Internet browsing but this phone would constantly close my apps without an error and delete all the progress I had done with it. Not to mention using it in the lowest screen light would still make the phone so hot it would hurt to hold, and even iny pocket without use it would do it. Never had a defective Sony phone before and I got this brand new I honestly think thats just how it was supposed to work, which didn't work for me. I guess if you want a reliable phone and don't use apps or the Internet a lot I would recommend it."
"2258","Very good but I did get a sellsrecite"
"2259","nice phoe"
"2260","very nice phone love it"
"2261","Very good"
"2262","I'm still getting used to it and as usual comes with a lot of apps that you don't want or need but speed is good is easy to customize and was able to do the transition from my old phone pretty quickly"
"2263","The phone works fine but wont hold charge the battery drain very fast, I fully charged night before in the morning the battery only has%30 .it has also over heat problem."
"2264","So I just got the phone today and I'll leave another review in a few weeks. So far it's nice. The touch response is great, the resolution is great, the camera isn't bad if you manually adjust it, but the shutter is slow and having to change the settings often could be a drag. The only thing that scared me is that I've felt a couple momentary lags and it's the first day, but I was installing a bunch of apps, so we'll see. It's just my opinion, but I like the UI. I really hope I can enable voice to text. I bought the phone at $200,so it was definitely worth the price. The port covers are awesome, much better than those on the first z. My wife had the moto g 3rd Gen, so I'll leave a comparison soon."
"2265","great phone easy to use, the only disadvantage I found is that it heats rapidlyboth the frontal and back cameras have a very good resolution"
"2266","I cannot figure out how to use it."
"2267","Poor packaging. The phone that was sent to me does not have us warranty. Amazon cheated me on this. I tried to register on Sony support site. It says that this phone is not meant for US and does not recognize it's IMEI and says no warranty. Battery drains fast. Back Camera takes awful pictures. Did not expect that from Sony. Not sure if I got new one or refurbished crap. Feeling cheated."
"2268","Best phone I have ever owned and clearly one of the top ten Android phones ever made."
"2269","Excellent phone does everything as advertised. I'm very happy. For the money you would be hard pressed to find a phone with similar features."
"2270","This is my first mid grade Smart Phone, and I love it so far!"
"2271","So after long deliberation about my first smartphone, I chose the Sony Xperia M4 Aqua. I have had Sony Ericsson phones before that were very sturdy so I was hoping for something similar. My husband trusted my judgement, and also needed a new phone, so we ended up ordering two. We've had them for seven weeks now;Frankly, I am very disappointed. If I have one word to describe this phone, it would be: slow. I did not install that much apps or anything, but when switching on the phone, it just takes a long time. Also, when opening social media apps like whatsapp or facebook, it just keeps switching off and on while you are typing, extremely annoying. Taking a picture of something that is not a still object, is practically impossible. It takes 3-4 sec to take the shot, which is a very very long time. So you end up always missing that one moment. And when you take the picture, after a few seconds you see a frame being 'saved' but this is not the picture you end up with. So blurry pictures are now a big part of my library, unfortunately.Even worse with the video recording - without any sign that something is wrong, they can end up completely black. I was taping two of our friends saying 'I do' at their wedding, and afterwards it turned out there was absolutely nothing on the tape (you did see that something was taped though, and I could 'play' it, but as said, it is completely black). Next video I tried turned out fine - no idea why. But again, I missed the big moment because of the phone.When someone calls and you just touch the screen somewhere to pick up the phone, you are disconnected most of the times.My husband's phone stopped working after five weeks of light use - microphone did not work in 4 out of 5 times. He had to ship it to be looked at and has to miss his phone 15 business days without any replacement. This is completely unacceptable for a brand new phone! He should just get a new one, if you ask me.Also, be careful when placing the phone in your pocket, because the back tends to become really, really hot- almost too hot to touch at one point. Can not be healthy to walk around with, close to your body.And the last thing I do not like is the fact that it is too big for my hands, but that's just because I have rather small hands.What do I like -- I like the design- I like the fact that it's water proof, however did not put this to the test yet- I like the the ringtones- I definitely like the battery life (two days easily), takes at least 6 hours to recharge though.But I would not recommend it to anyone.UPDATE: in looking for a solution for the videos always turning out black - I found that this is an issue that is often reported and well know to Sony. Their only solution is to restart the phone. Then 1 or 2 videos can turn out OK."
"2272","Excelente"
"2273","Best in this price... I love Sony always...."
"2274","Perfect . Amazing phone for that price . I recommended a lot"
"2275","Received this product very quickly after purchase (I ordered it monday and got it on friday). So i really liked that. It was a new phone, the color on the box was not the color of the phone, which i didn't mind at all. (The box showed a white phone, though i had ordered a black one) Turned it on and works beautifully right now.Price: not terrible for this phone, so all around I am happy with my purchase"
"2276","Do not buy this product. I hate it. This is my first comment. I used this to take some photos. However, the photos can not be saved to the phone."
"2277","I HAVE ORDERED MY PHONE AND RECEIVED IT, WHEN I TRIED SWITCHING ON IT DIDNT ON AND I TRIED PUTTING CHARGING BUT STILL ITS NOT ON,TRYING TO CALL CUSTOMER SERVICE WILL SEE WHATS THERE RESPONCE ??"
"2278","Not sure yet"
"2279","This phone though a nice slick phone has a serious heating problem at the back. Even through a hard case its still warm to the touch. Sony needs to get this temperature thing right?"
"2280","A very sturdy phone, little bit slushy at times, but makes my teen-aged son happy-happy. Heats up soon with few apps/games running (and especially if you have a protective case). As an ardent Sony fan, the price and the quality of this phone is good. Would have given 4+ if not for the sluggish and heat factor. Best suitable for an early teen with minimal usage (and as expected gaming usage)."
"2281","Had for about a week, with no complains. The only problem I've noticed is a typical heat increase when gaming, and the YouTube isn't the best (takes a while to load videos)"
"2282","Love it"
"2283","very good"
"2284","Really a junky phone. Have only had 4 months now, and cannot hear a phone conversation unless I have it on speaker phone. Also constantly loses the 4g connection, I have to restart the phone so it will connect."
"2285","Great"
"2286","Worst cell phone ever, not reliable. It just heat itself and turn it off for several hours until the battery is drained. Not recommended at all, returning it to amazon."
"2287","I am writing to you to report the problem has been happening with my Smartphone Sony Xperia M4 Aqua , which since last January I have given use, it turns out that the problem started slightly from about 2 months turned off and lit , passing day the fault was increasing as the image on the screen froze , then think of a distortion of colors and shapes, he turned it off and had to resort to forced restart.The phone will have been two factory reset , and does not have different applications bringing (except for Whatsapp ) and currently does not work, start logo Xperia then Android , distortion of colors and shapes occurs on the screen and is off and so is every cycle ."
"2288","I received the cellphone in January 2016 because im from Venezuela. Its was a gift for my girlfriend and the last month was her birthday. The cellphone does not charge, the green led is off even when the charger is conected. I tried with differents chargers, computer conection, differents cables, press the reset button for 15 seg 30 seg 1 min 5 min. Press the vol+ and power button, vol- and power buttom, press the power buttom for 5 min, all kind o recommendations from sony.com and nothing. The cellphone does not start. I want to know what i can do about it. Thank you for your time."
"2289","I've been having some problems with the phone. I've tried to get a hold of the warranty that it came with and they said to just master reset my phone. I like the phone its just giving me a lot of technical problems."
"2290","*Update after 5 months*Loud speakers blew out.I'm pretty sure it's from being caught in heavy rain a couple weeks ago.Buy this POS at your own risk.It's cheaper right now so it could be worth the money.I've had this phone for a couple months now. I really haven't had a problem with it. The screen can get pretty warm at times but it hasn't overheated. The camera is really nice just not great in horrible lighting and the battery life can drain pretty quickly depending on the activity, but that's fine lol my only real gripe is that there aren't any good (protective) cases for it."
"2291","The phone itself is not bad, but the customer service from Sony is awful. After a few months of using the phone, the ear piece in the phone stopped working, I called sony and explained the problem, it still worked on speaker, and with the handsfree set in, but not when holding the earpiece to my ear. They insisted it could be a software glitch and had me reset the phone..... twice, which did not work.So I had to send it in for repair, and this is where the fun starts. Having been told it would take about 14 business days to fix and send my phone back, I am currently still waiting and we are on business day 28. To this point, after 4 phone calls, and 3 emails (because one representative actually told me that they didn't have a way to call people at the facility where the repairs take place, true story!), still no-one can tell me when the phone might be fixed.With that in mind, I asked for a replacement phone the last time I contacted them, I felt that was not unreasonable as they were well past their own schedule for repairing and returning my device, and clearly could not give any clue as to when it might be done. They simply ignored that request and said that my phone would be repaired and sent back when they got the parts in. This could be in 6 days, or 6 months.I would not by this product and would recommend people avoid sony products if this is what happens when the slightest thing goes wrong. The support (or lack thereof) is appalling for a company of their size and standing, and it could be a simple fix, if they would just replace a device when they are having so much trouble finding the part they need for it. Instead they are leaving a paying customer hanging, with no recourse, and without the phone paid for."
"2292","I bought this one. However It was not work. So, I returned this item, however my credit card was charged again by seller's mistake. DO NOT BUY THIS s***"
"2293","I got this on a lightening deal for $200 bucks. However, I want to address some claims. Unless you are a very light user you will not get two days off a charge. If you are a heavy user, you might not get one day. I'm a moderate user and typically end the day in the 20%'s, which is good compared to my old iPhone. In spite of reviews, games with a lot of graphics do not play well with this phone, a lot of lag. Angry Birds, Minion Rush, laggy. Camera is a big disappointment, slow to turn on and slow shutter response. Quality is ok, you just never know when you're going to get the picture taken. Other apps all work well without lag. I really like the thinness of the phone and the 5"" screen. Audio connected thought Bluetooth is loud. Call quality is ok. Works great with Android Pay."
"2294","Excelent"
"2295","Love it"
"2296","Overheating problems since the first days. I hate this phone"
"2297","Really good for the price. I have had the phone for about 2 months.I'll get to the two things I don't like1) No Wireless charging... can't really complain but the flagship phones have it. For the price this is no big deal but I miss it.2) Camera is ok. Its not great. If you buy a phone for casual photos you'll be fine... if the camera is biggest deal ever for you then you may be disappointed."
"2298","This is a sweet phone. They make the phone look really classy like Sonys higher end models. The insides are quality components that should perform better, but comparison tests show that it is a bit slower than similar hardware. Attribute that to the 'pretty'sony software/theme. Testers go out of their way to really torture this phone on youtube (see xperia m4 aqua nutella, knife, waterproof) and this ip68 rated phone does really well. I love this phone and am considering their tablet now. Water And dust proof, beautiful design, memory slot. What more to ask for? Laugh at those fools that spend nearly a grand on these 'smart phones', and then end up getting it wet or shattering it. No nense in spending that especially when you will replace them in a year or two. Thats just being a dumb user and giving money away to the company so the can build a spaceship campus. Battery life is impressive: with everything on (broadband data, wifi, bluetooth) and normal use (texting, phone, some surfing) it can go 3.5 to 4 days between full charge. The full charging itself is very fast, i say under 2hrs. This is all without Sonys battery saving modes! I'm testing the two battery saving modes now. Incredible phone, and looks very nice. Buy this phone for 2-3 hundred, spend another 15 on nice rubber case and glass screen protector. This phone looks and feels amazing in its protection, not clumsy and goofy like those samsungs and apples. Yes, get this phone and you will have a smart phone with a smart user, instead of blowing a grand on some ARM PoS that can barely compute."
"2299","Ok. Overall. The delivery was delayed by a week. User experience is excellent with the price."
"2300","Very Good Smartphone! Im happy with this cellphone is very fast"
"2301","Bought this phone on September 7 2015 and my screen was damaged I did not drop the phone or anything I turned it on and the screen looks dim from the bottom and lightly dimmmed on top and the screen looks blurry didn't even last a whole two months."
"2302","Great!"
"2303","Phone developed a problem with the microphone after about 10-11 months of regular use, with the microphone completely failing within days of the 1-year warranty being over. Tried hard resetting the phone, upgrading the software to Android 6.0.1, but the problem could not be resolved.Contacted Sony support and after plugging in the IMEI their website says my phone was not under warranty, even though it was within a year of my purchase date from Amazon.Also had regular problems with SMS messages on this phone - messages received from people would periodically be in all Chinese characters (copied and pasted to Google Translate and the translation made absolutely no sense). I also had quite an unreliable time receiving MMS group text messages, with some responses not being received, or in the incorrect order. This is after consulting with the AT&T website and confirming that I had the correct APN settings entered.I tried the default Sony messaging app, Google Messenger, Google Hangouts, Textra, and other SMS/MMS apps, with no success.I have thrown in the towel on this phone, especially after the manufacturer refused to honor the 1-year warranty (as advertised in the product description)."
"2304","The phone won't turn on again, only 6 months after buying it."
"2305","Great smartphone. Everything is ok. No problem at all. The price was even better. Thanks."
"2306","Another great Xperia smartphone from Sony. Nothing to complain about. Great phone."
"2307","The phone runs very well when I first got it the battery got really hot not sure what the problem was there but after the system update and restarting the phone it doesn't get hot anymore I wouldn't put it completely under water but I have used it in the shower many times never had a problem with any of the functions. to prank my friends I poured water on it thrown it in puddles and tossed around with a case of course and it's still fine. The wife didn't like the quality of the camera she likes to take selfies I didn't really find anything wrong with the camera myself"
"2308","Excellent works very well in Venezuela Movistar"
"2309","Oh this phone is great. I love SONY!! Sleek design and very good."
"2310","This phone has mostly just caused me problems. Sim cards won't work, pictures won't store, wifi is spotty. Just a headache."
"2311","all fine"
"2312","Product received super fast and as described."
"2313","Its great but it heats up and it gets to the point were it burns you hand, if you going to use a protector i recommend it and also glass and plastic doesn't feel right, you only choice try it or not."
"2314","Soon It began to be slow and microphone suddenly did not work anymore"
"2315","Bought cause my Z1s was damaged beyond repair and I've only had this one a few days. So far it has been great however I'm not a heavy user of apps and games. I'm hoping the heating and locking and slowing down problems I've read about are simply due to the early lolipop upgrades which nearly bricked my Z1s when it first came out, it was aweful, but after a long while and updates it finally started running smoother and cooler. I really like not having to pull a clip/door open and close every time I want to charge this one. The headphone plug doesn't seem quite as sturdy but if it works it works, the sound with my sony earbuds (the best earbuds for price too) is louder and seems to sound better on the M4 Aqua which is also good. I keep wifi and bluetooth turned off and it seems like it will last about the same maybe a little bit longer on average but not much, maybe could push 3 to 4 days with little to no use during that time, estimating 8 to 24 hours on a heavy day. Direct charging speed from wallwart usb seems pretty fast to me, still slow if usb from my laptop. Over all there are subtle differences, but nothing really bad or nor great, I love the sleek flat design of xperias, abd tho I know support kind of sucks, I'll keep my fingers crossed, I'll remain a Sony fan."
"2316","At first the phone got super hot and battery drained in less than 4 hours. It was either an update or me changing the network to ""2G only"" that helped to solve the problem and now the phone lasts easily for a day."
"2317","Battery does not as long as it is advertised"
"2318","Love the phone and it's under water capabilities. But the screen spiderwebed the first time I dropped it. :/ so the weakest screen on an xperia I've had so far."
"2319","I absolutely love this phone. I'm on it all day long. And yes it is waterproof which makes it even better. I will strictly be buying Sony Xperia phones from now on."
"2320","I am enjoying my phone. It's my first non-windows phone in 7 years. The camera isn't as good as the Lumia 830's camera."
"2321","It's fine for the price (I bought it for 150$+tax), has no so good camera, I was hoping a pretty good camera because... it's sony! But nope, is just ok. Ah, is really a pretty phone, good quality screen. Totally worth for the money."
"2322","ITS A GREAT PHONE!!"
